The boat was moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out:
I shall know about that soon, for I shall soon speak out to Athos.”
Have they spared me?
Coquenard; the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.
Do you know that I am growing old?
Baptistin looked at his master, who made a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him.
“The signs just now, and the holy water!
Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king’s room, so as to form a kind of trap-door.
On, then!
“MY DEAR COUSIN, I think I shall make up my mind to set out for Béthune, where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the Carmelites; this poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she cannot live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger.
D’Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand, and fell on his knees before his mistress.
I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I know that well.
“Hum!” said the host, in a doubtful tone.
“No,” replied Mousqueton, “Parry kept it.
“Jump then, Monsieur Pistache.”
The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.
It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect.
As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information.
“It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing.
D’Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness.
Poor Danglars looked so crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him.
“Luxury has everything.”
He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o’clock; he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontainebleau.
“On what?”
In the proper time and place I will remember everything.
“Yes,” said she, “it is Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us.
“My wife is at Durham and may return at any moment.
M. de Monte Cristo yields his right of using his.”
I am a physiognomist, I assure you.”
“What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?” was the reply, “I can do that when we get there.”
Your hand, Athos!”
The Château d’If Chapter 9.
“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,” replied the young man, “and that was fanaticism.

A dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.
The communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which does you honor.
But, contrary to all expectation, when the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual precision.
“Good-morning, creditor,” said he; “for I wager anything it is the creditor who visits me.”
“‘You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal parts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only persons who have loved me upon earth.’”
“In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made,” continued the impassive cardinal, “there lodges, I believe, a young Béarnais, a friend of the Musketeer.”
D’Artagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized them.
“Of course we do,” replied Albert.
Chapter II.
“He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited.”
M. d’Épinay became very pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the club were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks.
ah yes!” Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke; “I know your devotion to her majesty.”
“Let us proceed.”
This idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the stone-work.
“He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.”
“Well, then, it is a settled thing; and now, my lord, will you obtain for me an audience with the queen?”
“The Comte de Rochefort!”
Porthos didn’t understand any too clearly; but then we know that understanding was not his strong point.
“Héloïse, Héloïse!” he said, “what is the matter?
“With all my heart!” replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so tractable.
Barrois asked, “Mademoiselle Valentine?”
But if he annoys you, this young fool—”
Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she answered immediately.
“Indeed!” said Winter, “it appears to me like a bar of red color.”
Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed towards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”
“Why?”
“Presented to whom?”
“Stop, sir, look yonder,” he whispered; “don’t you see in the darkness something pass by, like shadows?
“Let us see if she shuts the door after him,” he muttered.
Oh, that I could, instead of taking up this defence, shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in worth.”
“Singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and pocket-book.
“What’s your pleasure, gentlemen?” replied the peasant, with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de l’Universite.
There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII.
“Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,—at any rate they postponed the matter for two months.
“Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?”
“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis.
The whole of the second story was set apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister’s apartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room, where he received his friends.
“No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that you will not complain, but hope?”
His task was the more difficult, as there was no board to support him.
“Oh, _mon Dieu!_ that is very easily done.
My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in heart, in person, and in thought.”
“Water, water!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Go away as quick as you can, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “and stay till I send for you.
“Let us go and see whether they are quite dead, or if they can still be helped,” suggested Raoul.
“I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_, in order that my suspicions might not be noticed.
“Good-evening, M. Beauchamp,” said Monte Cristo, as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening; “be seated.”
“Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000?
Think of it, sire!
“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.”
“Well, that some one will open the doors.”
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.
what is your name?”
“Then let us pray to Heaven,” said the girl.
This last expression of Richelieu’s conveyed a terrible doubt; it alarmed D’Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a warning.
“If,” she said, “there is one among you who knows the king, let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there.”
_Le Blanc_ was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace; in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from Compiègne, and four o’clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop.
“And I was asleep,” cried Raoul, “whilst you, sir, you had the kindness to attend to all these details.
The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind.
“Gentlemen,” said the count, seating himself, “permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may commit.
He placed the casket on the table; then opening it took out a little golden box, the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring.
“Well!” repeated Porthos.
He again struck it, and with greater force.
Remove from me the remains of doubt, which, if it change not to conviction, must become remorse!” The count bowed his head, and clasped his hands together.
de Villefort, the king’s attorney?
M. Danglars appeared; Debray reseated himself.
“But, God forgive me!” cried Anne, with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her, “I believe that you are yourself interrogating.”
A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning; but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly.
This fortress was his post as king’s attorney, all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.
Well, does not this tell you that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to beyond?
“Do you understand me?” he said.
Often he awoke in the night, suddenly, dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beaufort.
The two friends went near him.
“Then you pity me!”
“What?” said Morrel, “you dead?”
The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought.
“It must have lost its ferocity in the second generation.
This look of Porthos’s made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning.
The bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps.
M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation.”
“Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form, and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de Saint-Méran.”
There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat.
“That is forbidden me,” said Grimaud, “until the last moment.”
The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable that, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place.
We shall be carried in triumph.”
“Thanks to the influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty has been removed.
And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet.
“Ah, to inquire after the little La Valliere; she has sprained her foot, you know.”
“Why, he is a second Ariosto.”
The count then looking over into the street, saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over.
“I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me, my lord, or my prince, as it may suit you best to be called,” said our Gascon, who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat.
Upon the whole, however, the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while the crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each.
They quickly went downstairs.
The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.”
“Make it, monsieur, I listen.”
At three o’clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the other Swiss.
At this order, given in Athos’s habitually calm manner, the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthos’s brow grew smooth.
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices.
“Then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a priest—you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me.”
He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _Thousand and One Nights_.
Who knows?

He drew back terrified.
“But you’ll die of hunger,” said the patron.
“Yes, that was the way it ended.”
As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.
And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on the contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in anticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.
Allow me, then, sire, to intercede for her with your Majesty.”
A large wound, extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.
D’Artagnan trembled.
The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense not to say anything.
“You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the Château d’If to be imprisoned there?”
“Monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.
“Then, sir, allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man.”
And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.
Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and said the prayers of the dead.
My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved.
“But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de Saint-Méran?”
“I wish to see the governor.”
“Benedetto!” exclaimed an inspector.
D’Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.
“Hush!” said Mme.
“Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.
He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes, that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends.
Tréville,” added the king, in a low voice, as the others were retiring, “as you have no room in the Musketeers, and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps, place this young man in the company of the Guards of Monsieur Dessessart, your brother-in-law.
On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person, who, standing on the threshold, awaited news of his vanished master.
A week before he had received, in a cradle, a beautiful little boy three months old, with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words: ‘11 October, 1633.’”
“‘That Gascon’ has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent, address and political skill, to him he was only a tyro.”
“And as for me,” said Porthos, “I swear nothing, but I’m choked.
Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress.
Porthos raised his terrible fist, which whistled through the air like a sling, and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter’s skull and crushed it.
Comminges, Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men.
“Is the spot far from here?”
“Yes, there it is.”
“Well, take your hat and gloves,” returned Monte Cristo.
“Through or over; coachman, gallop on.”
Did you ever suffer from a strain, Athos?”
“Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.”
“Oh, this is what I feared!” said Morrel.
The moment that D’Artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him, he recovered his usual tranquillity.
“Oh!” murmured Valentine.
The carriage started at a measured pace, without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry.
A new governor arrived; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners; he learned their numbers instead.
Inform this dear friend that he may remain within, that I shall go and see him immediately.”
“Go, Laporte,” said the queen.
“Ah, that is where the art comes in.
“I do not ask you of his origin but what he is.”
“Sir,” said Albert, rising, “I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons.”
Mercédès raised her head, and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her.
“I can see nobody,” said D’Artagnan.
“Take care,” returned Albert; “no one has been able to accomplish that.”
As to the details, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the subject.
“‘Madame and most faithful wife.’”
Grimaud placed the pie before the duke, who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust; but La Ramee, who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art, passed his knife, which had an iron blade, to the duke.
M. Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs.
“Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture.”
Villefort went himself to find her; and d’Avrigny approached Noirtier.
“At what o’clock, please your Majesty?”
“Is that all, monseigneur?”
The position of the cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had added to his difficulties.
Well, I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone—positively gone.
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes.
I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to recompense and punish.’ Satan bowed his head, and groaned.
ah!
“Unless?” said Mordaunt, whose face was lighted by a savage joy as Cromwell spoke:
“Well, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment.
“Well, do you comprehend now?” inquired Faria.
So much penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely remove his suspicions.
In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet “baby grand” piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry, and Porpora.
“Only reflect, my good fellow,” said Athos, “it is but dying rather sooner.”
He then went out backward, and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm, crying aloud, “Long life to the Monseigneur!
“Come this way, gentlemen; come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made before the competent authorities.”
“Valentine,” said he, “dear Valentine, you must not speak thus—rather let me die.
“I am sure of it.”
“The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince.
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, cocking his pistols, “I will take charge of the one at the top; you look to the one below.
“What did he say?”
We set out last evening and here we are.”
“My child,” returned Monte Cristo “you know full well that whenever we part, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the flower—the flower falls from the tree.”
She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating.
“To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution, and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and carry off the prisoner.”
Do not seek to assist me in that which I am accomplishing.
Beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated; his story, however, had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things.
He was placed before a large glass, which reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move, which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him.
“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a simple narcotic!
“It will not be so difficult,” replied D’Artagnan, springing to the ground.
When D’Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about five minutes, and twelve o’clock was striking.
The young man was opening the door of the stable.
Molière had not written his scene in “L’Avare” then.
“I do not believe there is a God,” howled Caderousse; “you do not believe it; you lie—you lie!”
“Threats!” cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the defensive; “you are certainly going mad.
“Probably, if ever I get out of prison!”
“I want none; it was a temporary indisposition.
“The same as yourself.”
At Verberie, Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them; he had been observed to pass only three-quarters of an hour previously, but he was well mounted, as the tavern-keeper had already said, and rode at a rapid pace.
“I do not say,” replied Andrea, “that you never make a good one; but let us see your plan.”
“Excellent, my dear friend; better than ever.
“Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but tell me what they want.”
“Such was Cardinal Richelieu’s opinion, my lord.”
“You knew it?” cried Morrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte Cristo started,—he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved; “you knew it, and said nothing?”
“We expect him every moment.”
“Well, monsieur,” said Bertuccio, “this man with this spotless reputation——”
“_Parbleu!_” said Albert, “do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers’ clerks?”
“Is it pressing business?”
This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them.
“It is to be to-morrow,” said Aramis hastily.
“That is a strange question,” said Aramis.
“Go, sir,” replied the tutor; “but in Heaven’s name do not expose yourself to danger!”
“They may if they like, but we will not.”
Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced D’Artagnan had he dared; meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself.
“Yes, count,” returned the notary.
He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every ten steps to look at the light in Milady’s apartment, which was to be seen through the blinds.
A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open the door himself.
But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not here?”
*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS ***
“My very good friend and excellent neighbor,” replied the count, with a smile, “you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
“Maximilian,” said the count, without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle, “I come to seek you.”
Athos put his arm around Aramis’s neck and embraced him.
He cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him.
I assure you I intend to play the devil’s game to-night.”
“Yes, for an instant I hoped it was so.
“Your majesty is mistress,” said La Meilleraie, retreating a few steps.
and when?
“Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.”
queens are the weakest of their sex, when it comes to such things as these.”
I am ready.
“His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty’s favorite, if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for ourselves.”
Believe me, we have passed the time of success in intrigue, and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting Paris, where there will always be two queens as long as you are there.”
These are our arms, that is, those of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield, which has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother’s.
“Monsieur Bazin,” said Friquet, “Monsieur Maillard—you know who he is, he gives holy water at Saint Eustache——”
“I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my young comrade.”
Grimaud contented himself with pointing D’Artagnan out to his master with his finger.
Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Albert’s invitation.
“And see, here it is,” said the count.
I like your manner, Raoul, and your politeness has touched me.”
“Formerly I was your junior by two or three years, and if I am not mistaken I am turned forty years old.”
The moment you become an inhabitant of France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.”

Danglars intended travelling to Venice, where he would receive one part of his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna, where he would find the rest, he meant to take up his residence in the latter town, which he had been told was a city of pleasure.
Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of his folly, should attempt things beyond his power?
It was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first to arrive.
“Sir, will you grant me my request?”
Athos smiled.
Oh, succor him!
“Seek, then, my lord, seek these gentlemen; and if they will consent to go with you to England, I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne, besides as much gold as would pave Whitehall.
In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and, young as I was, I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads.”
“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”
“Where do your excellencies wish to go?” asked he.
When supper was over Blaisois entered.
“I fear I shall not have that honor.”
“He is alone?”
However, I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.”
You will get yourself decapitated, my beautiful queen, and that would be a pity.”
Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself, he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least a cardinal.
“Then why do you apply to me?”
Ah, I see you are smiling.”
“Go!” said the duke.
“But they will contest the will after your death?”
“Where do you live?”
One of the two, who was standing up, was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall, whilst the other, kneeling beside him, was collecting the pieces of stone.
Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.
But Danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting-master.
He alone would have any influence with them; I do not even know them under their true names.”
Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest.
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair.
Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, _family affair_.
Whilst Porthos, still in bed, was hooking on his cloak for him, a second knock at the door was heard.
“To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.”
Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive, sudden, and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and Villefort.
“Alas, sir, I never had any opinions.
“I know him well there!
It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by dazzling her.
D’Artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself.
“Yes, yes,” said La Ramee, “the matter concerns you, for you will have the honor to serve us; and besides, however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst, there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles, and that something will be yours.”
“Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.
It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that, particularly at this period, the compatriots of D’Artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated.
Halloo!
You are, therefore, your own master till seven o’clock in the evening; but at seven o’clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.”
“No, your eminence.”
He immediately made a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred paces from the camp.
“Where is Raoul?” asked Athos; “how is it that I have not seen him?”
“Your betrothed,
“Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will want a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.”
Come, Planchet, let us pay a visit to the king’s treasurer and then set off.”
But we must say farewell, Edmond, and let us part.”
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.
“As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the philanthropist.
30229m
“Have with you for one throw!” said D’Artagnan.
“Speak,” said the queen.
Then he came to the corridor, all the doors of which he found open; so, too, was the door of Athos’s chamber and that of the park.
“I had well concerted my plans,” pursued Aramis; “the coadjutor gave me sixty men; twenty guard the walls of the park, twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain, twenty are dispersed in the woods.
“Well, now, what are your conditions, if I employ you?”
And I, who have sworn to take him dead or alive, I am dishonored—and by you!”
“Oh!” exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.
The count bowed.
“Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.”
While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table.
I do not know you.’ ‘I am,’ said I, ‘the little abbé who reads _Lives of the Saints_, and translates Judith into verse.’ ‘Ah, ah!
“Would you have given up the letter, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan.
“What means this?” asked the count.
“Ah, no, madame, that could not be.
The order was obeyed; D’Artagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle.
“Well, what’s the matter?” asked the latter, “are you going to be ill just now?”
D’Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Tréville entered.
Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a bitter disappointment, he asked, “Have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice, Laporte?”
“Who told you so?

“There, you see it will not take long.”
La Ramee continued: “My lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to-morrow en tete-a-tete.”
Soon as Kitty left him, D’Artagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Férou.

“Well, it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests, and I remember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me, curled up, swinging its head and pointing its tongue, I remained fixed, pale and as though fascinated, until the moment when the Comte de la Fere——”
I am entirely at your service, except only for my orders.”
“Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor.”

Then, in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps, for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends.
Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command,—“Courage.”

“Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.”
“Pardon me, sir,” replied the valet; “you had forbidden me to disturb you, but the Count of Morcerf has called me.”

Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by Ali, and were received by the Abbé Busoni, who was praying by the side of the corpse.

Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity.
The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.

“You pushed me upon a heap which rolled down.
Paris is not paved with cambric!”
“Does anyone dare to slander me?”
“As happy as it is allowed to one of God’s creatures to be on this earth; but say out all you think, D’Artagnan, for you have not yet done so.”
You would fight only by broad daylight, warn your foe before an attack, and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness.”
“The will!” exclaimed the queen, frowning.
“I,” replied the Gascon, “I believe in devotion as a word at one’s baptism, for instance, which naturally comes before one’s proper name; every one is naturally more or less devout, certainly; but there should be at the end of one’s devotion something to gain.”
“With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!” said another.
“What does this mean?” demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.
On the summit of a rising ground, a little in advance of the enemy, appeared a short and heavy looking man; this man was surrounded by officers.
The company of French guards was composed of half of M. Duhallier’s men and half of M. Dessessart’s men.

The Prison Register Chapter 29.
So saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.

“Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders.”
“My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the Abbé Busoni.

Shut the dungeon as if he were alive—that is all.”
“Shall you be present in the reception-room?”
You will need it this evening, perhaps; you will certainly need it to-morrow.”

At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses.
“Now,” continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend, “now, as you have heard, D’Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal.
“But look!” exclaimed Madame Danglars.
It was the governor who returned, followed by the doctor and other attendants.
“Well,” said Franz to his friend, “what think you of all this?”
It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happy,—his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you.
“I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile.
“Come, gentlemen, have you decided?” cried Jussac for the third time.
“What was the name of your old master?” said Monte Cristo.
Groslow began turning the cards one after another.
The tiger, whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of blood—it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation——”
Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again approached her, and said in an agitated voice, “Now you may drink.”

I hear my brother.
He then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance.
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche.

Grimaud moved as if to leave the room.
While we wait, time will be progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the evening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of morning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a single day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.”

“He is not curious,” thought D’Artagnan.
“I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is all—to Athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters of Forges; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend, whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition.
Madame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when she saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head, and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran downstairs, disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her.
Well, here I am; be satisfied.
“No; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the interests of an illustrious personage.”

“They are about to send into our court, which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery, the two guards who attend him.”
“Have you really met with some great misfortune?”
“Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars.
“But,” said Danglars, who, on his part, did not perceive how soon the conversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a business transaction, “there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you?”
“No.” replied the captain, “but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port.”
His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.
Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic—Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost; Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart—in short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself, “You will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle.”
I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning, and here I am.

In your case it would be a crime.
There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate.
Doubtless, too, the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them.
“Sir, I am very hungry,” replied Mouston.
“And you have a letter?”
“Perhaps you mean to disobey me?”
This immediately recalled to D’Artagnan’s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of Mme.
After casting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier.
Suddenly an idea occurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.
I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haydée.
These men were shopkeepers, who had arms to lend to those who had none.
“Thou leavest thy servants, Lord, To see if they be strong; But soon thou dost afford Thy hand to lead them on.”

“No, my lord.
Has he not seen Monsieur d’Artagnan at my house?”

“Well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks; and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire.”
“I do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost.
“It is done, gentlemen,” said Athos.
D’Artagnan, I have always loved you as my son; Porthos, we slept six years side by side; Aramis is your brother as well as mine, and Aramis has once loved you, as I love you now and as I have ever loved you.
D’Artagnan did the same, with a little more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he fully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with the steeds.

“And Lord de Winter—do you know anything about him?”
“But what would you have us to do here, now that the king is dead?”
“Signor Pastrini,” returned Franz, “you are more susceptible than Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience.
No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.
I would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the Bastile.”
“Of lofty stature.”
“My father, who is a merchant, placed me with his correspondent, who in turn sent his son to join our house in London.”
“I fancy I begin to see my way,” murmured Milady, with a savage joy, burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction.
“A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow at the castle, and will return as often as you desire her presence.”
At this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that D’Artagnan could not repress a burst of Homeric laughter.

“I take them, then,” said the lieutenant.
“I would contest nothing; but I tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral, and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister.

Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.
He was a relentless enemy, that damned cardinal,” continued Aramis, glancing at the portrait of the old minister.
Caderousse signed it.

“We must extricate ourselves from this position.”
In losing sight of his guardian, whom he had quitted, gazing after him in front of the royal basilican, Raoul spurred on his horse, in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections, but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might betray.
He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards.”
You have often heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?”
These two instantly mounted, the coachman of the latter replacing D’Artagnan on the coach-box of the royal coach.
“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation and force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie?
“Ah, my child, my poor child!” cried the baroness, falling on her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief.
“At least,” D’Artagnan said to himself, as he took the road to Villars-Cotterets, “at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking.
I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years.”
Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and offended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was destined to hurl.
But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced.
“Let us talk a little,” said she.
From that day D’Artagnan felt lonely and powerless, without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from Heaven.
The countenance of old Dantès brightened.
The path was wide, but dark.
“See that you forget nothing,” said Athos, appearing to look about him, that he might hide his emotion.
“Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.”
“You persist, then?”
Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for?”
Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note, written in these terms:
As for the two others, I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real ones.”
“Thank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever,” replied Mme.
For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean.
She was carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars was recognized.
“As for me, I feel anxious to preach a sermon,” said D’Artagnan.
Happy, on the contrary, for what am I in want of?
See!
“My letter of recommendation!” cried D’Artagnan, “my letter of recommendation!
“Well,” answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness.
Oh, man, man—race of crocodiles,” cried the count, extending his clenched hands towards the crowd, “how well do I recognize you there, and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves!”
“And have you never revisited that village?” eagerly asked Madame de Chevreuse.

He says to you jauntily, ‘Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in Flanders; go and fight,’ and you go there.
He fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five years of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly marked nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache.
“Yes, in your own way.”

“Their vows were sacred and irrevocable.
“This moment come, my lord,” said D’Artagnan.
you look dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle Eugénie?”
Why, that’s as long as the Almighty took to make the world!
The Abbé Busoni did right to send you to me,” he went on in his ordinary tone, “and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future.
Athos made no reply.
“I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,” murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.
In the first place, La Rochelle appeared impregnable.
Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword.
Giovanni, light a torch,” he added, “and give it to his excellency.”
It was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet.
Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the evening.
I will have my eye upon you, for I shall be there,” replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, “and on our return, well—we will settle our account!”
There came to the court an ambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost her heart to him; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them.
The dishes were of silver, and the plates of Japanese china.
“Yes, you are right, D’Artagnan, a fatality that will separate and ruin us!
No voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity; the officer seemed a statue.
“Come,” murmured Athos, “if she is not proud of him, she must be hard to please.”
I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me.”
Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up.
This is the fourth which you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years, madame, I have only seen you four times—the first, which I have described to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens of Amiens.”
“I won back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my horse, and then I lost again.
The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable’s length of shore.
“Come hither, I say, and don’t be afraid,” continued Athos.
“Which means—” said D’Artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.
Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty.
So saying, the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.
D’Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Tréville, captain of the king’s Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men, serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
I am but a minister, who wants no servants, being myself nothing but a servant of the queen’s.
D’Artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side.
D’Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many; but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him.
A ground floor, ornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and another floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the eye.
D’Artagnan bowed.
I detest her, from antipathy.”
At any rate, tell me: there’s more chance of fighting in Paris, is there not?”
But as there were all kinds of people about, who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court, he whispered in his friend’s ear.
“The contract shall not be signed!” cried Morrel.
I will run, then, till my legs no longer serve, till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do.”
“Ah, yes, most assuredly,” said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.
“‘Close the door,’ said La Carconte; ‘I do not like open doors when it thunders.’
“But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.”
They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks.”
“I am not without a good reason for my conduct,” replied the banker.
You have doubtless heard of these massacres, your excellency?”
“Not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs, and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us; besides, it is rendering a service to one’s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them.”
“I?” said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, “when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast!
The carriage stopped at the door of the house.
“Aha!” he cried with a smile of satisfaction.
“How do you take it?” inquired the unknown; “in the French or Turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling?
The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen _entrées_.
“Monsieur de Chavigny—where was he?”
Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a Crœsus.
He was therefore instantly recompensed, either for his address or for his sensibility, whichever it might be termed.
“Athos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time,” continued Tréville, “to a young Béarnais, a cadet in his Majesty’s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had he arrived at his friend’s and taken up a book, while waiting his return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house, broke open several doors—”
“But come, what is this about?” asked Porthos.
“I am grateful to you for the sacrifice,” said Aramis; “but if your body be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.”
The child did not answer.
Then turning to Aramis:
She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of Buckingham.
“Come, then, and take it, friend,” said the Gascon.
“Oh, fie—a quarrel between priests, a duel between allies!”
Adieu.”
He opened his eyes.
“And if I lose?”
At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room.
Two hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved.
“Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest success.”
At first, on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed, D’Artagnan tried in vain to open it, but on the powerful shoulder of Porthos being applied to one of the panels, which gave way, D’Artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock.
“Half Norman, half Mecklenburger; will go night and day.”
“No, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he had received orders from his master.”
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind.
“Still my young scapegrace.
We have said that at half-past twelve o’clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had left home in the carriage.
The latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together, said:
“The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,” replied the young wife, “a fine well-grown girl.”
This boat contained an officer, a mate, and eight rowers.
Do you understand?” asked Villefort.
The prince assigned to every one his post.

Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North.
Another Queen in Want of Help.

“Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three cupboards.

They heard the guard going its rounds.
Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents; nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection.

He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything.
Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion.

One evening, when Mazarin, according to custom, went to visit the queen, in passing the guard-chamber he heard loud voices; wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing, he approached with his wonted wolf-like step, pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink.

“In that case I am lost,” said D’Artagnan.
“The best swordsman in the kingdom, my lord,” said D’Artagnan.

“Well?” asked Aramis.
“Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,” murmured Edmond.
The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room.
“That is true, Monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and whether drawn by myself or another, I assure you I shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman.
“Was this prepared in your presence?”
Athos and D’Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer.
Bazin, who was crossing the ante-chamber majestically in his clerical dress, turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him; but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them.
“There he comes,” said Beauchamp, “on horseback, at full gallop, followed by a servant.”
He then gave himself up to his happiness.
“I am lost!” was his second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea’s situation, an arrest meant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.
While the banker was waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and instead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments, and disappeared.
Aramis started back and drew his.

“It is true; I am too good-natured.
“For you, monsieur,” said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young man.

“Well,” said the count, “you do not get out, M. Bertuccio—you are going to stay in the carriage, then?
“The truth is, I’m very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me,” said Porthos.
“Yes.”
But no, the communication would not come through Madame de Villefort.”
“And as for your poor arm, what difference will that make?
“Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,—it is at Auteuil.”
There was a moment’s silence, then the carriage cleared the gate.
“But what were you to do with that woman?” asked D’Artagnan, with anguish.
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command had to be given to each.
Alas!
Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”
Speak!
Certainly, there are people whom I love.
Mordaunt replied by trying his opponent’s weapon with an amount of strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble; but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt had just achieved, he succeeded in meeting his sword, which slid along his own without touching his chest.
“Listen to me, Franz,” said Albert; “I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has always been courtesy itself to us.
“‘I swear it before the God who hears me.
Grimaud bowed, but stepped back.
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers.
“I should say no.”
“And I, madame!” said D’Artagnan, embarrassed; “you promised me—”
“Pardieu!
The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence.
“Very good,” observed Danglars, after having read the paragraph; “here is a little article on Colonel Fernand, which, if I am not mistaken, would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary.”
Monte Cristo motioned him to be silent.
Danglars turned pale; Cavalcanti moved a step forward, and Albert turned towards him.
Athos went down to pay the reckoning, while D’Artagnan and Planchet stood at the street door.

Then taking a passport from his drawer he said,—“Good, it is available for two months longer.”
“That is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be brought in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and devotedness—why, I should be a ruined man!”
“Courage, take courage, my dear mother!” said the girl.
“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to you only.
I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them.
“Do not lie, my angel,” said D’Artagnan, smiling; “that would be useless.”
“At least that will conciliate us all,” said Aramis.
It is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little Madame Bonacieux.”
The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort.
It was time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man-of-war.
The king has nothing like it.”
“Yes, but the fire,” ejaculated Mordaunt; “I have lighted it.”
Lord de Winter, on quitting D’Artagnan, gave him his sister’s address.
“Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure.
At nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night; then running downstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a cab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.
“Bring hither that horse.”
You do not know what felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a moment like that.
if he comes?”
“Shall I see you?”
“I, married?” exclaimed Monte Cristo, shuddering; “who could have told you so?”
Madame Danglars moved rapidly, as though she would spring from her chair, but Villefort stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention.
Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that permission.
Then, as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue, which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner, Athos and Aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured, and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent.
Let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts.
“Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,” replied Madame de Villefort.
He esteems me highly.
I received this morning five millions which I paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me; I put this creditor off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today, to escape that tomorrow, which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure.
“Well, Porthos, follow my examples; walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea.
Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome, left his name at Madame de Chevreuse’s and wrote the following letter to D’Artagnan:
“My most faithful friends, gentlemen, my most faithful friends; you have proved it.
He knows how, as you must have observed, to obey an order—for you did not, I am sure, come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak.
Can I be of any use to you?”
Near her was Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make use of.
“What prince?” asked Albert.
“No.”
“Listen,” said Morcerf—“if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to agree to the arrangement.
“Now, Albert,” said he, “you understand me—do you not?
D’Artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul, whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot, and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other.
Have you a name, then?”
Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes.
I believe he’s swimming toward us.
“Yes, but he must make haste; for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them.
As for Porthos, he assaulted the foe with such violence that, although his sword was thrust aside, the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it.
“Me!
He has been beaten.
Raoul handed the letter to the prince.
to have to make a false excuse to Porthos!
“You have a recipe for it?”
The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the gates of London.
“Come, come,” cried D’Artagnan, “we must finish with this,” and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard, who continued to lose ground, but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment.
The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition; she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from some odious calculation,—odious, as all his calculations were.
The other day a banker’s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold.”
So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep, that when at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him, his first words were: “Well, what’s the matter?
“None at all.
Bazin sighed.
“As for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran toward Ali Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips.
“Twenty-five pistoles,” said D’Artagnan.
“He?
“Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a Jacobin?”
“And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.”
The house to which D’Artagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening.
“Indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars, “I am ashamed to own it, but all your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me sit down;” and she fell into a chair.

“MONSEIGNEUR, Let your Eminence be reassured.
“Well, baron,” said he, “here I am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.”
The conversation had rested there and Scarron, through sheer obstinacy, had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently.
“My child,” exclaimed the old lady sharply, “let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future.
As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for five-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.
“Your arm is still strong enough, is it not, Porthos?”
“Well,” said Andrea, “let it be as you wish.
D’Artagnan scratched his ear.
“Oh,” said Porthos, “death is nothing: it isn’t death that can disquiet us, since we don’t know what it is.
“Yes,” stammered the old man.
Say that I am permitted to walk in those woods.
As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her.
Are you sure?”
“My poor child,” replied Monte Cristo, “that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you.”
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a shutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-law’s _fauteuil_, Milady, anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of possibility, and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen.
“I love to see you thus.
“You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him, and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him.”
“Then you are attached to me?” asked the duke.

M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his share of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become bankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do—disappear.
“He is dead, sir; a great loss.
“Sir,” he said, “there is one window of the convent lighted up.”
The Pardon Chapter 117.
Fortunately, I don’t know where he is.”
“And matches?”
“What have I, then, done to you,” said Felton, much agitated, “that you should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men?
“Porthos, my friend, you know I am descended on the father’s side from the Prophets and on the mother’s from the Sybils, and that I only speak in parables and riddles.
“Oh, my lord, my lord!”
“I do not know,” said Mercédès.
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more; Danglars, therefore, concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from Switzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and the sterlet from the Volga.
Danglars, astonished, opened the door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled on.
“Tréville’s company.”
As for Porthos, I believe him to be eternal, like God, although less patient.
“His eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed, and wants you instantly.”
Here it is!”
Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it.
Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as the tragic poet says.
The major drew himself up to his full height.
“Here I am,” smiled Porthos, with his sublime composure.
“But how can I sell out here?”
Unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his word.
At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Cromwell.
Is he still as stingy as ever?
“‘Tush, tush,’ cried the men; ‘keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at Nîmes.
“Give up Broussel!” she cried; “fine counsel, indeed.
I do not feel remorse, because that woman, I profoundly hold, deserved her punishment.
“Father,” cried Maximilian, “how could you say the _Pharaon_ was lost?
It was the same court of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak, except that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had himself been part of it; therefore everything which the Count de Guiche related was new to his traveling companion.
“I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted.
Speak loud, very loud, for they will be listening at the door.
“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.
The next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the fever had not abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability.

“Excuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.”
“If he is dead, I shall die too.”
Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him.
The citizens always took up arms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against nobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the cardinal or Spain.
“My brother, who made you his heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body.
No?
“Monsieur,” said the steward, “it is fatality, I am sure.
“Did none of you charge your purveyor, Godeau, to send me some wine?”
It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.”
“Pardon me, you are right.

“No.

“The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen in Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbé Busoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has done much good.”
“Let us hear the history,” said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to seat himself.
“When will you do that?”
“Eh, pardieu!” said Mazarin, with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money.
Certainly I see him.”
Then, turning to Noirtier,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”
“How the devil hast thou two horses?” asked D’Artagnan, jumping on one of them.
Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no doubt, a great lady—for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the Mass.
But tell me——”
The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands.

“I am young,” gently replied Haydée; “I love the life you have made so sweet to me, and I should be sorry to die.”
Andrea read in a low voice:
D’Artagnan signed to them to draw near.
Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook, which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened.
But to die?
Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of Paris.
If he turned up an ace first he won; if a king he lost.
“What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine; “you no longer seem to love any of us?”
Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward’s extraordinary repugnance for the count’s projected drive without the walls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey.
Athos did the same.
Aramis, at this movement, drew his sword.
The door opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared.
With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn, which he observed within gunshot range, a little in advance of the place they had reached.
“He was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor himself.”
Monsieur!
“Do you then really suffer?” asked Morrel quickly.
Now, to see things which I cannot understand, to procure impossibilities, these are the study of my life.
“Then, here’s to our next merry meeting!”
He repeated his question.
I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare.
At this moment the clock struck eleven.
Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and as she constantly bent over her child, it was difficult to read the expression of her face.
D’Artagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses, but the cardinal shook his head.
“Do you intend to sit up for me?”
He looked at Albert—he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half smoked it.
Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny, and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio.
“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular.
“Hey, friend!” cried the duke.
Are you not rich yourself?”
“In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.”
The young shepherd stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher, followed him for a second in his track, and then fired.
Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons; Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands, Athos with his sword in his scabbard, his pistol in his saddle-bags; calm and cool as if on the parade, except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes.
Then the cardinal added, “_A propos_, sire, do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her.”
“No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.”
“I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a half; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the profits.”
My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities.
“Delightful; shall we be quite retired?
“Against calumniators,” said M. de Tréville.
“Pardieu, if that is all, I am hungry, too; but it is not everything to be hungry, one must find something to eat, unless we browse on the grass, like our horses——”
They advanced, and Athos, who was the first to enter, gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face, framed in its long and now untidy, matted hair, the blue veins showing through the transparent temples, his eyes seemingly swollen by tears.
Words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors.
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept his face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with her eyes.
“How can I tell you?”
“My Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return.
“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without raising his head.
But I was going to tell you that I met M. de Morcerf the other day.”
You can understand, dear friend, with what hope I was inspired by that last letter.
“But,” said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, “I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question.
“When once in the Bastille, there is no afterward!” said the cardinal, in a low voice.
But I repeat to you, I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up—”
“Will the petition go soon?”
“What as to the carriage?” exclaimed Albert.
They ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately.
ignorant of their real enemies, they do not perceive that it is not the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine things to them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.
“What?” said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this speech.
When they arrived at the antechamber, above the door was visible a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture, indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon.
Monsieur the Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion.”
D’Artagnan saluted M. de Tréville, who held out his hand to him; D’Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude.
M. de Tréville entered the king’s cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty in a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the handle of his whip.
“Keep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.”
“And now, my dear child, adieu for the present.
“But who is she?”
Chapter IX.
At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever, and when they parted, each to take the route agreed on, they turned back to utter affectionate expressions, which the echoes of the Dunes repeated.
“Oh, count, have pity upon me.
Come, calm yourself, and reckon them up—M.
“Sinbad the Sailor.”
“So far, so good,” laughed Athos.
Such was Albert’s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection, he made no attempt to change it.
“In which world?
In order, doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission, the priest rose as soon as d’Avrigny departed, and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but also that leading to Madame de Villefort’s room.
“Go; I must be alone.”
The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off, only the doors are locked.”
The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her affection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover.
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “don’t be too angry with me, I beg.
Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No.
Not a thought was given to a life which you once, Mercédès, had the power to render blissful; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel.
“Edmond Dantès, _Count of Monte Cristo_.”
We dispense with your saying grace.”
“Well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a condition to pay them.”
“How much?” asked Athos.
“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”
Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse him!”
D’Artagnan, Going to a Distance to discover Aramis.
“Or rather, sir,” said Aramis, with his peculiar irritating politeness, “the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom; for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not mistaken, we saw you in the company of a third gentleman.”
“‘How, and why?’
“No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?”
“Yes,” said the old man.
“M.
“If a man had by unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your betrothed,—a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound that never closes, in your breast,—do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?”
“She is ill!
An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through.
“_Ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of the singular remark he has made about me.”
“Let him run on,” said Danglars, restraining the young man; “drunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.
“Agreed,” returned Albert; “but remember, Signor Pastrini, that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for.”
Chapter 74.
“Yes, if the thing be possible.”
I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be named lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion.
“Well,” said Porthos, “arrange the table, Mousqueton, and while we breakfast, D’Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us.”
“Where is the count?—where is Haydée?”
“Is everyone here, your excellency?”
“As to that,” answered Mousqueton, puzzled how to get out of the difficulty, “I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the English.”
Valentine opened her eyes.
Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box.
“I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code, but as regards the codes of all nations.
“Dreaming.”
how kind you are,” exclaimed the young man, pressing his guardian’s hand; “and I can set out immediately?”
“Oh, it will happen, you may be sure,” said D’Artagnan.
“But,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “why was I absent?
The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement, and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor.
You see, I have been a soldier ever since I attained manhood.
It was Ali, my Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.”
Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place.
“Monsieur does me wrong,” said Planchet; “I thought he had seen me at work.”
“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.
But this confession concerns me only.
I, your son, as you call me—I will not let you!”
“If these are Spanish doubloons, or even gold crowns,” thought D’Artagnan, “we shall yet be able to do business together.” He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket.
“It is enough,” replied the prince.
“That would be nothing for us four; it is too much for us two.
Are we not two despairing creatures?
“Nevertheless,” said Athos, “in your absence——”
Metà della metà.’9
Beauchamp, who had watched with sincere pity the young man’s paroxysm of grief, approached him.
D’Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent speech.
The duke uttered a cry, but Grimaud did not give a single moan.
She has taken care for herself,—at least I hope so,—for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me.
You shall place it on that table, and you may remain between it and me.”
“And why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow?
“True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together.”
“I am commissioned to seize your person, sir,” said Comminges, in the same tone and with the same politeness; “and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me.”
“But there are no more,” said she.
Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and when he returned to defend his benefactor, he was dead.
what are his means of existence?
The evidence will support it.
“My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of Providence and the love of Maximilian.” Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.
“The bodies were not plundered, were they?
“‘“I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII.
“Raoul!
This track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore.
“Stop a bit,” said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, “stop a bit, I am in it.
That’s more time than we want.
Now Mazarin was alone and defenceless, as he well knew.
“Mind, Aramis”—D’Artagnan smiled as he spoke—“since we are together again, let us agree on one point: what age shall we be in future?”
“Of course.”
“Very well, monsieur; I will obey you at all points.”
Go and look for the Comte de la Fere; I wish to speak with him.”
The tumult now began to increase; the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction; the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage.
You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them, can act with energy——”
Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I detest you.
It was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a fire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September.
“Did he die?”
“No,” replied Andrea, dryly, “no, I cannot.”
Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins.
“Just so, take it and go.
death is depicted on his face!
“Do not let us do things in a hurry.
I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an exception to the usual form of accusation.
“Certainly.
“Nonsense?
“Zounds!
“Then?” asked Caderousse, shuddering.
persons whom I do not like!”
He then laid him down on the floor, where D’Artagnan, after giving him just time enough to draw his breath, gagged him with his long scarf; and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle.
“This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.”
Only, that there may be no delay, I shall borrow one of your horses.”
Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris, why this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why this lost kiss?
“Don’t disturb yourself, Julie,” said he.
“‘And follow me wherever I go?’
“I confess it.”
“Halloo!” he cried, “are the prisoners still there?”
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment.
“If what you say be true,” replied the count, smiling, “perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family?”
It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people, generally, alone attended.
“Yes.”
You see I am calm and strong.
Nobody serves me for nothing.
I had quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”
“Mademoiselle’s lady’s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.”
“What the devil are you going to do?” cried D’Artagnan, “you will be shot.”
“You?
Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions’ example.
“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.”
Then turning to D’Artagnan, she said:
“By me?
“Soon,” said Haydée, “we halted on our march, and found ourselves on the borders of a lake.
“Good-day to you; have you slept well?”
“And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice.”
I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something.” Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said.
Certainly, after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de Villefort towards his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to the authorities; then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death, as I now am, sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall become the avenger.
As yet he could form no definite plan; all must depend on circumstances.
I am not yet twenty-one, and Eugénie is only seventeen; but the two months expire next week.
“His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together.”
Leave your hold, then, I beg of you, and let me go where my business calls me.”
“Whom are we going to attack, sir?”
Haydée’s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers—nay, there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence.
And he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass.
“Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment.
In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness.
“Vicomte, come here,” said Athos; “the duchess permits you to kiss her hand.”
“Let us go!”
“I?”
Let us, then, support monarchy, in order to support ourselves.
Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.”
“Of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.”
As she told the queen, she had not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal—a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only a political precaution.
“She was young, you say?”
Père Pamphile, more wine!”
Through this the king was to escape the next night, and, hidden by the black covering of the scaffold, was to change his dress for that of a workman, slip out with his deliverers, pass the sentinels, who would suspect nothing, and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich.
What has the count done?
The salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same expression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these two living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room, forgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation.
He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound.
“The other night she left.”
“And who is this wretch?”
“What do you mean, blockhead?”
Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left, and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity.
“We are forbidden to give you any explanation.” Dantès, trained in discipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.
“Thanks, madame,—thanks for your punctuality;” and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated.
Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some place.
“Come,” answered Mazarin, “I see it will be necessary for me to capitulate.”
“Yes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of her, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while I—”
In that boat sat three men, unquestionably brave, whose courage no man would have dared dispute; nevertheless, at that voice, that accent and those gestures, they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins.
You are free, you leave the count’s house, and you take your mother to your home; but reflect, Albert, you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her.
with Anne of Austria—for that affair was over—but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre, who was embroiled with the Duc d’Angoulême.
“Avenge me of that infamous De Wardes,” said Milady, between her teeth, “and I shall soon know how to get rid of you—you double idiot, you animated sword blade!”
“Because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying that Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound.”
“And where is he now?”
“Mother,” he said, turning towards Mercédès, “this is M. Debray, secretary of the Minister for the Interior, once a friend of mine.”
Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Mercédès in the world, and he might yet be happy.
“True,” interrupted the young man, “I had not looked upon it in that light.”
“No, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another, and pardon you.”
“Good!” said D’Artagnan to himself.
“We can only save you by being free ourselves,” replied D’Artagnan, in a rapid, low tone; “and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will arrest us with you.”
“Enormous ones,” answered Beauchamp.
“Doctor, do you hear them call for help?”
Never a mistake or delay—a fellow who paid like a prince.
“And you did not warn me!” cried Caderousse, raising himself on his elbows.
“After nine at night, pardieu!” said Aramis, “the rule of the convent is very severe.”
D’Artagnan, in particular, had a perpetual buzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: “A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere.”
I will do as children do, for fear of losing the paper—repeat the name along the route.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
D’Artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use.
Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to D’Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets—only she believed she could say she was not dead.
“Monseigneur,” replied Milady, “a fair exchange.
“That is to say, two hundred more—a hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me.
“Stay, sir,” said Anne to him.
The prisoner started and bit his lips.
his father!”
Take it quickly.”
“My idea?” said D’Artagnan.
Thanks to what Aramis had told him, D’Artagnan, who knew already that Porthos called himself Du Vallon, was now aware that he styled himself, from his estate, De Bracieux; and that he was, on account of this estate, engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon.
“Ah,” said Cavalcanti to himself, “if I only had that britzka, those two good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!” And he sighed deeply.
The windows on the ground floor, according to a custom in provincial villages, were barred, so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison.
“You said, sir, you would like to help me, but——”
“Parliament can never have passed such an act as that.”
“No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans.
The next day, on awaking, the count perceived Raoul by his bedside.
40112m
“Your turn, my Lord,” said Athos.
The prince leaped to his feet, extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound, there was no mistaking it—it was the noise of cannon.
“Yes, truly, dear friend; and I may even say the sight of you increases my dismay.”
Diavolo!” he exclaimed, “I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges, who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door, in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four-headed combination of devils.” And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps.
“Indeed?”
“Are not you the person who brought me a letter,” inquired Franz, “from the Viscount of Morcerf?”
“My dappled grays?” demanded the baroness, springing to the window.
“Let us go on to another of his exercises.”
Then, seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy, “Let us go out, Albert,” said he; “a ride in the wood in the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return to breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and I to mine.”
“That ring comes from Milady?” cried Athos, with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion.
“I see that you are right, logically speaking,” said Maximilian; “but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today.”
“She was my mother!” cried the young man, who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force.
Dost know where Porthos is?”
Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man!”
“Wait.”
The first risk that Dantès ran was, that the jailer, when he brought him his supper at seven o’clock, might perceive the change that had been made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue, Dantès had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word.
I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example to you—not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de Tréville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as a child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII., whom God preserve!
These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village.
“Drink.”
But the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.
“Oh, go on, monsieur, go on!” said Madame de Chevreuse eagerly; “you can’t imagine how much this conversation interests me.”
“Go on, I am curious to know two things.”
“Praise God, monsieur,” replied they, bowing together.
Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission; but the sentinel, who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general, thought the order did not extend to the young man.
The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air.
She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer.
I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king’s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would occasion a loss of precious time.”
In royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all.
I claim, then, the right to choose my opponent.
“Well, that she may have no doubt on that head, I will go and inform her myself.”
“Who and what is this man?”
“For everything,” cried D’Artagnan, who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus.
Dantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve.
“And I may profit by Monsieur’s happiness, and go to bed?”
“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord.”
If Bonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population.
If, after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not recover, then pour the rest down my throat.
The notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged the papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his spectacles, turned towards Franz:
If it were nothing but a sword thrust, why then—”
Sit down, dear count, and go on with your story.”
“Very well, let us say no more about it.
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill. As for you, although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves, I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field.”
“To cross the Tyne, reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose, who will not sell you.”
“It is he!” exclaimed De Winter, seizing the arm of Athos; “it is he!
“Reverend sir,” said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.
A red handkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton, they would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man’s shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw, seemed of gigantic size.
“Yes,” returned D’Artagnan, who had overheard him, “to-night, gentlemen, we rescue the king.”
Who will support them?”
But suppose one pass, as is permissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym, then, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an ‘elimination;’ you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence, without the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a punishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense of the word, of him who inflicts them.
“That’s the man, my dear fellow; he was an annoyance to the cardinal.
“Ah!” replied Mazarin, “so you have no money?”
And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.
“Six o’clock.”
let them come on!
“Chastised, Monsieur!” said D’Artagnan, “the expression is strong.”
“When my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier.
The Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of Sedan, and the title of prince, granted to him and to those belonging to his house.
Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake.
“The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted.”
You prohibited my mentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips.”
D’Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.
At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men, servants and baggage were aboard.
The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence.
“Certainly, I will do so,” said the young man, with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention.
Only he is not quite sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues.”
“Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed.”
Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court.
“Then you are wrong, madame.
You must not stop an instant on the way.
“Oh, a day and night soon pass away.
“What you find in your trunks.”
Go; I will reflect.”
THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON Chapter XXIII.
This alone can stop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which I aim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms.
a brute, that cardinal.
Where is the letter you speak of?
“It is no doubt the same,” said he.
and you, my lord?”
I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I have given up hawking.
“Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior.
“No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself.”
“Why did you not accept it?”
No!

He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support him on his horse.
“His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty, something secret and private—a mission that could be confided only to a sure man—and so has sent me to Saint Germain.
In consequence he took to his heels, arrived breathlessly at the councillor’s door, and knocked violently.
From Lyons to Avignon (still by steamboat).... ......... 16.
“But what is the use of harnesses without horses?”
“You know the watchword?” he said.
Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.
“I have no doubt of it,” said D’Artagnan.
“Nor in the third,” returned Porthos; “and even when one is killed, one rises again, the proof of which is, that here we are!”
“How very singular,” cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.
And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make D’Artagnan shudder, but D’Artagnan could now see it without alarm, and smiling in his turn, with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could, perhaps, alone give to his countenance, he said:
Franz remarked, while he gave these details, that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him, but that he was unwilling to ask it.
“Go on, D’Artagnan!
You are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect.’
Villefort shrieked, clasped his hands, and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air.
Raoul sprang from his horse, to which he left the charge of its own preservation, and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman’s side; he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water; the animal began to breathe again and, as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid, redoubled his efforts.
“Not too much so,” replied D’Artagnan, with a bow that was not deficient in dignity, “since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.”
The conditions are favorable; what else was opera invented for?”
The deputy procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.
“I, monseigneur?” replied Milady.
“Or kill yourself!” said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in the amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary).
“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment.
Occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary; the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.
The unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased, as he crossed the threshold, to be a man—he became a number.
“That is likely,” said D’Artagnan; “but the man who has abducted her—do you know him?”
“What circumlocution!
“Were you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,” replied Felton, “the greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself would aid you with my prayers.”
I began to fear that he would not come.
it is a very cold one, my dear friend,” said Aramis.
“Listen, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan; “you cannot but perceive that all this must end, some way or other.
“I know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.”
With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud.
“I am all attention,” said the abbé.
The result was that to prevent MM.
The prince was said to be in person at Bethune.
“What is the matter?” returned D’Artagnan; “we are saved!”
Apropos, if you fire—and you will do so, for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder—remember that in single combat, which often takes place in the cavalry, never to fire the first shot.
“Sir, we don’t keep any,” was the reply of the people who opened the doors; “but please ask at the hay dealer’s.”
I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be guilty of such a sin.”
I shot two with my double-barrelled gun, and two more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were still left; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so short, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan, and I already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom you see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre.
And who am I, to nourish such ambition?
Stay, count,” he added, “you, who may be called the emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces of paper of this size, each worth a million?”
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper, which regaled the passers-by through this Egyptian scene with its strident, monotonous note.
“I am at home to nobody,” said Milady; “observe, to _nobody_.”
destiny!” murmured the abbé.
oh!
Monseigneur!”
A few soldiers, commanded by a sergeant, drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse.
“Sir,” replied D’Artagnan, in the calmest manner possible, “you are very young; I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks.
“This moment, sir.”
“Where are we to go, my lord?”
“Yes,” said the duke, “but take care, my dear La Ramee, for I propose to beat you badly.”
Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice, in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp, like the hissing of young vipers.
“To himself, my friend, to himself!
“Athos,” said D’Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and appearing in his shirt, “prepare yourself to hear an incredible, an unheard-of story.”
“Where did he lodge?”
Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king.
“You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen?
It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan:
“Wait, then, monsieur, wait,” said the king; “I will not detain you long.”
“Well, pray, is there anything to be so surprised at?” he said.
He was alone.
We were speaking of hanging.”
“And then?”
“Have you any knowledge of him?”
“Yes, you, sir!

Having aroused the enmity of the Sultan, he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.—Ed.
He guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of Chantilly, when the procurator’s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse.
“You do well to boast of it,” said Andrea, who, without becoming angry, as Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.
“Now,” said the deputy, “answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?” And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him.
Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries.
“Prepare yourself, Maximilian,” he said with a smile; “we leave Paris tomorrow.”
“I have but one man on board, and I am as sure of him as I am of myself.
“I say so, and I repeat it for the third time; that house is one inhabited by my friend, and that friend is Aramis.”
Speak, speak!”
They close it.”
“Or find some one else,” continued D’Artagnan, turning his back.
He smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose.
“It is he,” said she.
“Now, say if I conceal anything from you?”
Charles, having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos, embraced them both.
“Sir!” cried De Chatillon.
“Sir, you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you when I have only just arrived, but——”
“You are right; but you have made my mouth water.
Porthos wanted to follow him.
“Without the saddle?” said Aramis.
“No, sir,” replied Anne of Austria, “and you may retire until the time that I mentioned to you.”
“Go away from here!” said D’Artagnan, whose purposes were in conflict with that order, “that is not so easy, since I am on the point of falling, and my horse, too, through fatigue; unless, indeed, you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.”
This last reason appeared convincing.
And he retired, discovering Mazarin, who was in great confusion, to the astonished gaze of Aramis.
Shall I speak to him?
“I have never accomplished anything alone,” said D’Artagnan, shaking his head.
“What?” said the king, with hauteur.
But his confidence in Grimaud, whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind, increased, and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance.
Chapter XIII.
The count took another spoon, and again dipped it into the golden box.
The committee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to shake hands with him.”
“How was that?”
“I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I conjure you do not abandon me.
“Some years only.
“And you will find traces of poison?”
“‘Every revolution has its catastrophes,’ returned M. de Villefort; ‘your brother has been the victim of this.
“I offer you a beggar, my lord.”
The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him closely.
“I have a letter to give you from the count.”
And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose, two of the first actors of the day, might have envied.
“Yes,” cried Morrel, “make haste.
“I think not,” replied Château-Renaud.
“The same,” said Villefort.
“No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household is almost unlimited.
“And you?”
What have I done, then?
Villefort understood the king’s intent.
My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure, for she is very partial to the little girl, to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter.
The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls, which were picked up by La Ramee and the guard.
“It is a wretched bed, but that is not my fault, and it is you who have chosen it.” With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary.
The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture, such as became a man of good birth, who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles.
As nine o’clock sounded, D’Artagnan was at the Place Royale.
Bonacieux blushed.
“You cannot think so, dear love!” replied D’Artagnan; “but now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?”
that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen days.”
He arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haydée, who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back.
“Yes, yes,” resumed De Guiche; “I am sure he can fire a musket when required.
“No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of anyone’s.
D’Artagnan felt himself bewildered.
“Ah, ah!” said Lord de Winter, “after having played comedy, after having played tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?”
“But as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?”
“Hush!”
“Well, if any misfortune happen to me,” replied Monte Cristo, “I wish my daughter to be happy.” Haydée smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head.
“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the priest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”
Should your hand still be too weak to use this sword, Raoul, so much the better.
“And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next apartments,” said Franz, “I warn you, that as I have been four times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you will make a good profit.”
“Who told you that?”
“We know him,” said Athos, “he never left the king.”
Then ’tis I who am mistaken, for you have always been a good chronologist.
to be named the Just—”
At half-past one they descended, the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises, which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever, and which gained them the applause of Franz and Albert.
“It is you, sire, who have now incurred hers.
At this instant the sergeant, who had been for his orders, returned, and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks, said:
“Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is impatient.”
The fact was that Emery’s son had run a great chance of being suffocated, one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed.
Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose you.
“I will not answer for it,” said Monte Cristo.
“Well, my good friend,” returned the abbé, in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part, “you are at liberty, either to speak or be silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end.
It was still about a quarter full, as we before stated.
Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange was exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished to come back as ambassador to France, the king himself—remember, my lord—the king himself opposed it.”
If I were a ‘Frondeur,’” said D’Artagnan, “I should knock here and should be sure of a good supper.
Seeing D’Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes.
What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end?”
“My good Charles, I particularly recommend to your care Planchet, the laquais of Monsieur D’Artagnan.
“Good!” said Caderousse.
Parry closed the door and approaching the king, his face radiant with joy:
“But then, philosopher that you are,” said D’Artagnan, “instruct me, support me.
“If he is a prince, he is wrong not to maintain his rank; I do not like anyone to deny his origin.”
He became curious to solve the problem.
“We are going to return to the service, Mouston,” replied Porthos, still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost.
He had a remarkably fine garden, full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit.
Chapter LXXXIV.
“Close by here, monsieur,” replied the notary—“a little beyond Passy; a charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.”

“To Saint Peter’s first, and then to the Colosseum,” returned Albert.
“Well, then,” said the baroness, “if slave she be, she has all the air and manner of a princess.”
The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.
The fragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès paused with anguish on his brow.
“You will do me honor, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan.
“I shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged.
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing.
“Thanks, D’Artagnan, thanks!” cried Aramis, almost in a state of delirium.
Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that as well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples.
The cardinal’s house had no secrets for me.
“That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone vow to live a single life.”
But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way—they killed time for him till eight o’clock in the evening; then would come night, and with night, sleep.
“Said to bear the name!” repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and eager.
Moral wounds have this peculiarity,—they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful, always ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the heart.
“But, for heaven’s sake—” resumed Aramis.
Woman is sacred; the woman one loves is holy.”
“And now,” said the unknown, “farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude!
The king looked at Aramis with astonishment.
“Haydée had remained until the close of the meeting.
He attacked this wall, cemented by the hand of time, with his pickaxe.
He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like that of a sleeping angel.
If you reveal it to anyone in the world, I shall be lost, and perhaps yourself likewise.”
“May it not be about that cursed affair?” asked Aramis, “in which case I do not greatly care to go, for it will be to pocket a lecture; and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them myself.”
Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your hands.
But you,” continued M. Bonacieux, in a tone of perfect good fellowship, “what has become of you all these days?
“And to think that I couldn’t find that out,” said Porthos, scratching his head; “it is so simple.”
“Nothing was certain; besides, her Majesty had said, ‘Ladies, wait for me,’ and she did not dare to disobey the queen.”
“Yes,” said Madame de Villefort; “and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of Valentine, to be altered in her favor.”
Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his sister-in-law employed them they must be the best.
Felton continued to descend.
They reached Saint German without any accident; on descending, the queen found the prince awaiting her, bare-headed, to offer her his hand.
While working night and day, I sometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better than suffering.”
Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with her.
He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his eccentric character, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune, he would produce a great effect there.
There were collected and piled up all Albert’s successive caprices, hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes—a whole orchestra, for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes, pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords, and single-sticks—for, following the example of the fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that complete a dandy’s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick; and it was here that he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.
“But from whom did this ring come to you, Athos?”
His voice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles; his eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a drunken man.
“No violence; violence is the proof of weakness.
“Upon my word, I think he acted very generously.”
“Why, I think,” said Aramis, blushing as usual, “that his ring not coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token, D’Artagnan may sell it.”
Take care.
She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.
The banker soon returned.

But the count did not answer.
Chapter XLI.
“Yes, if we are better mounted than he.”
The accident was set down to the account of robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood.
An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival.
The proposal was seductive, but La Ramee was an old stager, acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set.
It is not natural for letters to enter people’s houses in this manner.
“M.
It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore.
“Oh, take it—take it,” said the count; “Haydée is almost as civilized as a Parisian; the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her, but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume, you know.”
With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud, who followed the little troop, understand everything, and they passed on like a whirlwind, D’Artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice.
“That is the best plan, believe me.”
“Ho!
He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he should return by Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Nîmes; and, if I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at Nîmes, with an innkeeper with whom I had dealings.”
“Half a pistole if you can find out,” said D’Artagnan.
The president read:
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.
“Are you really frightened, madame?” said Monte Cristo.
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king.
“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself.
Be calm—for I am sure that D’Artagnan and Porthos are at Rueil, alive and well.”
“I wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep, my child; you must be fatigued from yesterday.”
His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.
“I do not think so,” added Château-Renaud, with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.
And they continued their way, crossing the barricades, getting the chains about their legs, pushed about, questioning and questioned.
But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light—that is to say, with all its advantages; when he had pointed out to her, in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris, the viceroyalty of Font-de-l’Arche, in other words, of all Normandy; when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font, Madame de Longueville contended no longer, except as is the custom with pretty women to contend, and defended herself only to surrender at last.
This one will not oppress you by his dignity.”
“You are a great almsgiver,” said the visitor, “and although you are said to be rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor people; will you accept my offering?”
“Shall we not set forth?” asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès; “two o’clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour.”
Athos looked at his watch.
Well, I have ten thousand for you.”
“But what must I do?” asked Milady.
I saw the executioner return into the king’s room, change his clothes, put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear.
“Luigi Vampa.”
“Well,” asked Anne of Austria, when D’Artagnan reappeared, “what does it mean?”
The first notary handed over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague.
sir,” said D’Artagnan, “how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side?”
“It seems to me,” said the host, “that this is not the first time I have had the honor of seeing Monsieur.”
“And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?” asked Beauchamp.
“What do you think should be done,” asked Athos, “if we have no news of them to-night?”
“I do not reject it altogether,” said Athos; “but I wish to remind Aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set out, all the Capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever person will be arrested.”
“Good-day, sirs,” said the duke, advancing; “you are puzzled by what you see here, but one word will explain everything.
But has one ever seen such a wild fellow,” continued he, “making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel!
“I took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who sent me a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners.”
“I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine—it was the second pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet.
“But after his bath?” asked Morcerf.
“I did, indeed.
Villefort went immediately.
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop.
“Oh,” cried Edmond, “to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles!
The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich, possesses a vessel of his own.
“I know so many men already.”
“No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to eat.”
“Monsieur Laporte,” said D’Artagnan, “go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king, but they shall see him in bed; add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence, so as not to awaken him.”
“None whatever,” replied Eugénie.
“To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders, your honor.”
“You are ungrateful, D’Artagnan,” said Athos; “yes, ungrateful to Providence, to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner.
“It is written in the good book,” said Monte Cristo, “that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation.
“The punishment?” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, “the punishment, monsieur?
“Now go down,” said the abbé, folding his arms.
Come, tell me!”
It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of D’Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away.
“Ah!
It must have been for his hide, for, _certes_, the carcass is not worth eighteen livres.
That glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin, who, reading in it a declaration of war, seized D’Artagnan by the arm and said:
“It is a long story.”
“Here are the horse’s hoofs again, it seems, Athos,” he said carelessly.
“I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him stammering,” said Planchet, in a piteous tone, “but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things, for I imagine that those lofty walls, now turning ruby in the setting sun, are the walls of Blois.”
“Grimaud always sees, dark or light, night as well as day,” answered Mousqueton.
“Yes, the priest.”
“Hold your tongue, hold your tongue, madame!
However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never even moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the trumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra.
He drew his sword entirely from the scabbard, and followed him, crying, “Turn, turn, Master Joker, lest I strike you behind!”
Ah!
You see there are two wanting.”
“Come at dinnertime.”
The light of day reassured me; I went and threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating knife, which I concealed under my pillow.
“You have no enemy here—there is no one but Fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.”
Your ignorance on the subject, therefore, is easily accounted for.
“Putting on his cloak and gloves.”
“Read!” said he, “read!
At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs; the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held.
It is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion.
A long pause ensued, which lasted until all the flowers were removed.
He stopped short.
“It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.”
Prepare, then, for your departure, and never despair of us.
Let him find it out if he can!
It need not be said that D’Artagnan was still thinking of the husband.
Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word.
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood.

“Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,” said Peppino; “You have paid two louis in advance.”
I have written a letter today; that letter is not yet gone.
God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse nobody.”
“Oh, yes, in spite of all I could say.
The carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed.
Yes, we are severed; there is the great, the distressing truth!
He opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief on the horizon.
“Oh, sire!” cried the four companions, with one voice, “we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majesty’s service.”
The keeper would leave me in the background, and take all the glory to himself.
“Give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then,” said the cardinal.
“You are right, madame, and I will not finish.”
You told me that!”
D’Artagnan, following the strange custom of the times, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders—Spain yonder, woman here.
“Surely,” said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, “that must be the Countess G——.”
On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away.
Ten leagues of wood, of marsh land and valleys; he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon!”
D’Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Tréville.
Anne hesitated.
The audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.
Chapter 37.
The bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason, was occasioned by the battle of Lens, announced by the prince’s messenger, the Duc de Chatillon, who had taken such a noble part in the engagement; he was, besides, charged to hang five and twenty flags, taken from the Lorraine party, as well as from the Spaniards, upon the arches of Notre Dame.
“But _I_ will know!”
“It is; it is I who tell you so; make preparations for departure.”
“When?”
“What!
“Ah, you frighten me.
“Thousands of wild goats.”
I know his character; he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests.
“You—you?” said the young man, looking fearfully around him.
His Musketeer’s uniform became him marvelously.
“And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?”
“But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October——”
As to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had more imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become pope, adorned his head with a cardinal’s hat.
“Indeed it is, after so long a separation.”
Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness.
Upon my soul, that future captain of mine is a lucky dog!
This is the matter, gentlemen; answer and exculpate yourselves, for I stand here to accuse you.”
“Ah, you scoundrel!” he said to the sergeant, “I believe you are impudent to me!
de Guémené.
“And I answered you, Porthos, that it was not a good plan; that we couldn’t go a hundred steps without being recaptured, because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves.”
“Ah, and a master stroke, too, I assure you.
“Mordaunt.”
He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window; he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards.
Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception of the one celebrated in the _Thousand and One Nights_——”
“I tell you what, M. Franz,” cried Albert, “you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now.”
Chapter LXX.
The storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane, whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.
You will restore them to her Majesty; and as a last memorial”—he looked round for some valuable object—“you will add—”
He extended a hand to Raoul and said:
Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof against him?
“Last evening.”
“Willingly,” said Maximilian; “particularly as I have business in that quarter.”
Louise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded lightly forward.
“Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay.”
Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali?
“But supposing he doesn’t mount?”
What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces at you?”
“Well,” said she; “if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment.
“Yes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without my tools I am fit for nothing.”
“Listen,” said the young man to the sentinel.
Gondy bit his lips.
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme.
“Yes,” replied the young man, “I ask you in what year!”
“I!” cried D’Artagnan, “not in the least.”
We shall require it.”
and he is dead?”
I forgot,” said Athos, laughing.
Chapter 38.
“This cannot be the establishment of Athos.
Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he might feel perhaps annoyed, but he knew Monte Cristo’s eye was on him.
I know it will end in that way; but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches, but——”
“And shall we begin at once?”
Fortunately, deceived by D’Artagnan’s trick, they neglected to reload their guns.
“And with all this, how unassuming he is!
I should never have the courage to come down again.”
“Yes, yes,” replied D’Artagnan.
“Only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one is poison.
“On paper.”
“Go, then, dear friend,” said Aramis, “follow your own career.
“He called her Milady.”
“Oh, yes; but only as No.
“Adieu, Athos, I am going to raise an army.”
“Mother,” replied the young man, “you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man.”
But go on, Beauchamp.
D’Artagnan drew from his pocket a paper.
Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete.
But let us return to yourself.
“Besides, sir,” said Villefort, addressing himself to his future son-in-law, “excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected will need not personally wound you; M. Noirtier’s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it.
“All the nobility of Rome will be present, and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society, she must go there.”
“You are only betrayed.”
“Unfortunately, I have no idea where they are.”
“They will come for her tomorrow or the day after, with an order from the queen.”
And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty’s service.
As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him, until, pressed on all sides, Scarron found no way of escaping his escort, except by throwing himself into the river; but the water was icy cold.
By that means all our secrets will remain in the family.”
This frequently happened.
M. d’Épinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum, shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.”
“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to Faria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you.
The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered, preceded by a sergeant and two men, who brought supper in a basket with two handles, filled with basins and plates.
“Everything is possible.”
At the end of the piece Étienne entered, and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits.
“‘“Then we run another risk,” said the general, laughing, “that of being upset.” We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly.
“And me, too!” said Aramis.
“I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations, but a foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor, demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty.”
At his mother’s ball he danced once with Eugénie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice of it.”
“We are gentlemen, monseigneur,” said Athos; “require our parole, and give yourself no uneasiness.
“He is.”
She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed:
“Peste!” said Porthos, “it would be a pity; animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each.”
Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean, he came, his horse going at a foot’s pace, to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year, seven men surrounded by empty bottles.
But tell me all about it?”
“But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,” said Franz.
“Well?” asked Athos, when he had closed the letter.
Caderousse continued to call piteously, “Help, reverend sir, help!”
“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man.
“Well,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you see, my dear friend, that this is war to the death.”
“I thought so, too; but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received from Madame the Constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show me, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on the road hither to take her away.”
They still hesitated an instant; but, as before, pride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.
It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,” interrupted Valentine.
“They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,” said another, lifting the feet.
The doctor stood before him, with one hand placed on his shoulder.
“Who are you?” asked the man.
Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke him, and to fight with him; all that would be folly.
“Haul taut.”
“Come, first of all,” said Athos to D’Artagnan, “my friend, that I may shake hands with you—you, our rescuer—you, the true hero of us all.”
“At Notre Dame.”
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.
“And what is it to me?” replied Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders; “do I know those people?
It was ten o’clock when they arrived.
“I say it is easy enough,” answered Porthos.
They will treat you as a deserter, I warn you.”
Since I have the good fortune to meet you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of your friends.”
“I shall be grateful to you all my life.”
It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her.
“Madame,” answered the count, “you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings.”
He was passing the Chinese Baths, and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte Saint-Martin, and to be going towards the Madeleine.
This woman exercised over him an unaccountable power; he hated and adored her at the same time.
“But if they refuse can I count on you?”
“It is over,” Aramis had said.
“What do you say to this, Du Vallon?”
Greet each other, then; and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads.”
“Unfortunately, that is true.
Nevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that Valentine’s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.”
Draw, if you please, and instantly—”
“Silence!” then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Felton.
“At least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity, that you love another,” said the young man, in a caressing tone, “and I repeat that I am really interested for the count.”
The presence of my daughter and myself in France is already irksome to him; much more so would be that of the king.
“I shall not sell it—do not fear.”
We here present the letter verbatim:
“Ah,” said Valentine, “the thing you desire begins with the letter N; it is with N that we have to do, then.
If the letter must be written under your censure, my faith, I renounce the task.”
Alas!
he knows how to crunch fowls, to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night, that’s all.
This, however, was nothing to a sculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a fresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it.
The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
“What are you doing here?” asked the count, seeing him covered with dust; “I did not send for you, I think?”
“His manners are admirable,” said the countess, “at least, as far as I could judge in the few minutes he remained here.”
What should I care for either riches or poverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her?
“Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,” said Franz, “that the countess’s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason.
“Well, let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor,” said the queen.
“And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six millions.
“Be seated, Juxon,” said the king, falling upon his knees.
“True,” said the major, “there might be doubts raised.”
Cromwell’s House.
“What does all this mean?” asked Aramis.
“But,” cried the young officer, “speak, then, speak!”
“Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind.
He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning.
“Well, my lord, what I foresaw has come to pass.”
How did you leave the count?” continued he.
They then separated.
The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie, which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected.
The queen then gave her orders, spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow, indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it, announced another visit on the following day to Val-de-Grace, where she intended to pay her devotions, and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her.
“Oh,” cried Andrea, leaping with joy.
Caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in, some way of escape.
“Aramis,” he said, “break your sword.”
The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo; and when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the coachman pulled up and did the same.
At length, he one day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be found, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of ransom.
“At what hour did he leave your hôtel?”
Then they saw, as the felucca turned, two other heads peeping, those of Aramis and Grimaud.
“And in half an hour,” said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, “our name is dishonored!”
“Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained?”
“Where is the prisoner?” said a voice.
My father looked at his watch, and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish.
“By a Musketeer?”
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people.”
“Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between Monsieur de la Trémouille and myself?”
come!”
“Oh!
“Perhaps it will be too late,” said Gondy, still unmoved; “perhaps I shall have lost all influence; while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt.”
What, then, to do?
“And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?”
We shall meet again, Master d’Artagnan,” continued the leader, raising his voice.
He remained, therefore, mute and motionless, hardly venturing to breathe.
“Do you know, sir,” asked the baroness, “that you are improving?
“How so, Planchet?”
With discretion D’Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed the threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young man, “Come in!” cried he, “and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her Majesty’s presence, tell her what you have seen.”
Chapter XIII.
The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions, good and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind.
“And you replied to him with that notion?”
Arrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house, isolated, solitary, and dismal.
I cannot now repeat to you, sir, all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was more than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and hate the Jesuits, said then to myself, ‘It is really well, and I am very glad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once, for I could not bear it.’”
Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead.
And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary.
He breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the beauties of the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon.
This was Albert’s favorite lounging place.
“And I am yours, body and soul!”
“How does that annoy you?”
“Yes, that is true as the Gospel,” said Porthos; “I heard her with my own ears.”
A quarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich.
This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await the arrival of M. d’Épinay, and the following day the contract will be signed.”
“He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of gratitude.”
“He is well educated.”
“Well, monsieur?” asked D’Artagnan.
You may conclude your interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to Signor Luigi, who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.”
“He is a glutton.”
“So much the better—so much the better!
D’Artagnan colored.
75.”
“The deuce!”
For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man, that dear Marie; I know only one other woman who can do it as well.
Albert advanced furiously towards Beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand.
“We must fly,” said the queen.
“Not at all.”
D’Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for.
When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir, to which we have already once introduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some drawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M. Cavalcanti, his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name.
“Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for it.”
“Then draw down your hat, sire, that he may not discover the substitution.”
“And, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris; I had need of distraction.”
“What are we to say to this?” asked Franz.
“I think he entered the service.”
But I will tell you.
Against whom do they cry out?
“In the first place, gentlemen, you know that I was the means of Monsieur de Rochefort’s escape; well, I was very near being hung by Mazarin and that made me more popular than ever.”
“At Bourges?”
Should you not have known me again, in spite of my eight-and-forty years of age?”
Gondy smiled.
“Indeed!
Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is very warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his place, but did not sit down.
To this question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them.
The queen had them.
M. de Tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning; only, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he informed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre, and that he might repair at once to his post.
A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to the fog, was the cause of this error.”
The servant drew back and said, “If you wish to go alone, sir, I will go and tell my mistress.”
“You are mistaken, viscount; I believe he has not a franc in his possession.”
They looked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence.
“Belay.” This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantès had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.
“She may have forgotten something.”
“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”
“Then I shall really have them?”
Go and see those whom you love and who love you, and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of you.’ And I came, sir,” added Raoul, gazing at the count with a smile of real affection, “for I thought you would be glad to see me again.”
“The monk!” cried the host; “where is the monk?”
The lieutenant’s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing-room; but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention, but began to arrange, with so much cleverness, nicety and gayety, his straw bed, that the mouths of all these poor creatures, who could not go to sleep, began to water.
“St.
In addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles.
It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage.
Haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors; she continued:
“Well, those studs,” continued Mme.
“Indeed madame,” said Monte Cristo: “I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am going.”
“Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?” asked Monte Cristo.
“In fact,” said Athos, “this delay is not natural; they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did.”
“Because they failed.”
Mme.
“Monseigneur is correctly informed,” said D’Artagnan.
He had at once declared for a military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the 53rd of the line.
“Ah, captain!” said the officer, “everything is quiet hereabout—if I did not know that something is going on in yonder house!”
He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress.
Come!
The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed.
But he was not listened to, and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the Spaniards.
He was coming here to hasten her marriage with Franz.”
Do you wish to destroy me?”
But let us wait a little and reflect.
The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed at once to the stable.
Noirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all.
Tell me, I entreat you, my dear doctor, that you may be deceived.”
“Faith!” said Porthos, “as for me, I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much.”
He brought it to bear, skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning, and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible.
“Ah!
Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts.
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded.
“Yes and no.
The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair.
“Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame.
“I should think so, indeed.
Suddenly the jailer entered.
Monsieur de Chavigny, be so good as to lend me your cane.”
“Go from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchâtel.
These words were addressed to the Countess G——, who had just arrived, and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia, the duke’s brother.
“Alas!” said Charles, “that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault.”
The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied.
He could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle-piece the countess’s smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen case, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered:
Ah, if I were but twenty years old!”
“Go to the devil with your Latin.
“The convent, your honor, is at the other end of the village; I know it well.”
“What do you expect to get?”
“Ah Comte de la Fere,” said a calm voice, though hoarse with running, “is it your habit to calumniate the absent?”
Aramis shuddered in spite of himself.
As to that, we know D’Artagnan’s courage; he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle.
Your orchestra is too noisy.
Few have passed through this revolutionary period, in the midst of which we were born, without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate.
Chapter XV.
The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night, but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose.
“What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!” remarked a third; “I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father.
Did you forget that this great man, this hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death, _prurigo_?”
your honor, in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels.”
Then, extending his hand, the old man said; ‘I thank you, my son; and now leave me alone.’
As D’Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not within.
The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.
And raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties, he said,—“Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!” And he fell back on the bed.
Seven o’clock in the morning!
The noble and distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself, that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness—such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more than the friendship of D’Artagnan; they attracted his admiration.
“There is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet; and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth.”
...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara
He heard me patiently, and when I had finished, burst out laughing.
He hoped, by means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much.
“I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself.”
“Instantly,” said Athos.
I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he will never return.”
“That is easily understood; it was you who took him, count,” said Raoul, smiling.
“Hold your tongue, stupid fellow,” said D’Artagnan; and laying hold of the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest injury.
“But I—but I,” cried Olivain, pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore, “how shall I cross?”
But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and inspired him with new courage.
Dantès thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land.
M. de Tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair.
“Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.”
“Who told you that, my dear?” asked Milady.
Are you one of us, Monsieur de Rochefort?”
My friend, you impose a painful task on me.
“The short one.”
“The Comtesse de—”
Just now, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.” Noirtier turned pale, and made a sign that he wished to speak.
The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to question the messenger, but he had disappeared.
“I do not send you away, but you have had the small-pox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you.”
What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another.
Really, honest men are not so scarce as I thought.”
“These young fellows can none of them drink,” said Athos, looking at him with pity, “and yet this is one of the best!”
They were attired as peasants of Albano, Velletri, Civita-Castellana, and Sora.
That, I think, is as much as I shall want.”
Ah, I would give much to have five hundred louis, only.”
And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who, ignorant of what had happened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing some new catastrophe.
can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
“Ah,” said Caderousse, “I had promised——”
In recalling all he had been through, he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer; and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man.
“On my word of honor,” said Athos, “one must be either a Mazarinist or a Frondeur.
“Ah!
What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged?

“Well,” said he, “friend, what matters the regiment of guards to us, and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance?
M. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and bolted.
He opened it and read as follows:
“No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.”
“Mordaunt!” muttered the four friends, exchanging glances.
“Look, look, doctor,” said Villefort, “he is quite coming round again; I really do not think, after all, it is anything of consequence.”
“Oh,” cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, “this is singular!
Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike reverence.
“Ah, but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow; Beauchamp, for instance.”
“But this is trampling on the weak, sir.”
“Then listen to me.
“I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.”
Night came, the two women had watched, hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard him pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps.
“Shall you have the courage?” said Athos.
“Go then, take what guards you find here, and pursue him.”
“Thank you, sir,” replied Raoul, blushing; “thank you a thousand times.”
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.
I will extinguish the fire with blood!
“But tete-a-tete.
“I will find the means myself.”
“Yes, count.”
“Why for him and not for me?
“When you like; but have you no groom?”
“Needless,” said the Englishman; “I am well furnished with such playthings.”
“But there are oubliettes!” replied Athos, smiling.
“Here I am, my friends,” replied D’Artagnan; “not only free, but in favor.”
“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air of determination that made his companion shudder.
Would you like a proof of it?
“That is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count, with all these horses?”
It was in this pavilion, on the ground floor, that D’Artagnan and Porthos were confined, suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament.
The count patted him gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
“Yes, how do you know it?
It was ten o’clock at night; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count’s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered.

“Yes, to a convent.”
“But what makes you sigh?”
“And now, once more, adieu,” said Morrel.
COMTE DE WARDES
You are Madame Bonacieux!”
stop!
“Name it, sir, I beg.”
I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me.
“Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you.
Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet, but he had seen nothing of D’Artagnan; they wished to take Planchet with them, but he could not leave his troop, who at five o’clock returned home, saying that they were returning from the battle, whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII.
“However, nowadays there’s no need of so much heroism.
Porthos and Aramis did the same.
“But have you not come from Auteuil here?”
“But to do this he must have spoken?”
Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city.
You do not believe me?”
You have acted kindly, count, in bringing me back to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss.
“What is your sister Valentine doing?” inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward; “tell someone to bid her come here, that I may have the honor of introducing her to the count.”
At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.
“Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I—it was La Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned to the galleys.”
Why, it is a rank of itself in France, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.”
Oh, no, Athos.
“An excuse for us!
“Ah,” said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; “yes, I have heard that death is in that house.”
“Oh!” muttered Mazarin, “I do believe he is going off with the diamond!
“What is the matter, madame?” said Mazarin, uneasily.
“Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,” said the Gascon.
“That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese, Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her mother’s side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will help you in the search.”
And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!”
The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon, washed the plate, which thus served for every day.
“Ah, they are my scourges.”
He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl.
“‘I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha.
“Wife, wife!” cried he in a hoarse voice, “come here!”
My dear Albert, one word, for I must give poor Lucien a respite.
“No; I am safe for a few days at least.
The monk made no reply, but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed.
“I want air, that is all.”
Every time I see you is a fresh diamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart.
The Two Prisoners Chapter 15.
“Take care, Albert,” said Franz.
Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him.
Why, he imprisoned himself, I swear to you he did.
Groslow jumped up, ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine, cards, and dice.
“In a dungeon.”
As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared among the rocks.
“Oh, that is very easily arranged.
The voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook the partition.
“Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful.”
“Yes, sir,” she replied, “every confidence; speak.”
“Read,” she said.
But, instead of growing easier, Dantès’ pains appeared to increase in violence.
“Hate you, blame you—_you_, Edmond!
“Is it a very beautiful vessel?”
Help me,—lend me your assistance!”
One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but not so the other; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them, hear them when or where he might.
“No; captivity has subdued me—I have been here so long.”
“Ah,” said Mme.
I recognized your name in it.
“Be quiet, Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “we are observed.”
Au revoir, not farewell.
Porthos looked at D’Artagnan, quite amazed at the resources with which his companion’s Gascon sharpness continually supplied him.
I wrote verses in the style of Benserade——”
Their spirits live in me.
Your very grateful, MILADY CLARIK
Friquet heard perfectly, but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road.
“You are right,” said the duke.
Where for?”
Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify, by a pretext at least, my abandoning my countrymen.
“I should never have thought of that,” said Porthos, “and yet it is very simple.”

“Twenty men.”
“I will, I swear to you.”
He knew all objection would be useless, and instantly determined how to act.
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until he found him.
“One minute,” cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to reply.
I think some one is coming.”
“Embrace, with all your heart, the vicomte, for your devoted, friend,
They were indeed two elegant horsemen, with figures slight and upright, noble faces, bright and proud looks, loyal and intelligent smiles.
Now, you understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years.
“I divined that you would become mine, count,” replied Morrel; “besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.”
“Ah, count,” said he, “his father loves him so much!”
“And where do the servants sleep?”
Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him.
The same had been done for the queen and Madame the President.
“That’s it,” said the tutor.
Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the count.
When my father conspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.”
“This is all very easy for you to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “for you, Athos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak, and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos, who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your valet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your theological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious man, with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means and without resources—for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even a Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the terror, or the respect in Planchet?”
My wife and child shall escape from this gulf, carrying treasures with them; she will live and may yet be happy, since her child, in whom all her love is centred, will be with her.
that is another thing,” said Porthos.
“Pardon, madame,” he said, “I am not a lawyer, I am a mere soldier, and probably, therefore, I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words; I ought to have said the wishes, and not the will, of the people.
“Who are you, then?” demanded D’Artagnan, lowering the point of his sword, but without yet surrendering it.
I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars.
Pardon me, monsieur, but you are not—”
“Where were you, then?”
What could be his intentions towards him?
“Then he must be a wonder.
“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo.
The king entertained great regard for my father, who had fallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted.
“I am only temporarily a Musketeer,” said Aramis, humbly.
“Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed.”
“Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly returned by the way he had gone.
“The king has made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for the paltry sum of two million francs, to a _mésalliance_.
“It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée.”
“Let my lord at two o’clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts.”
To-morrow we shall retake Lens and beat the enemy.”
Raoul bent his knee to the ground.
“Do you possess 400,000 francs?” inquired the notary.
“The king!
They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette.
“Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale.
Albert could not understand the banker’s look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it perfectly,—“Did you see,” said he, “how he looked at me?”
D’Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them to be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like so many madmen.
The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.”
“Today?”
Her face was so passionless, that he, as every one else present, was incapable of reading her thoughts.
He is waiting till your majesty is ready.”
With that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and when you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the hands of usurers.”
“Why,” replied Athos, carelessly, “she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.
“But a humpbacked general!
“And why, Parry?”
He approached the wall, and tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and D’Artagnan could get no hold.
Five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince’s door.
“And these men were your friends?”
We are friends, are we not?”
Athos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him to surrender.
“Why so?”
“You are here in the apartment destined for you, madame.
He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and which was surrounded with divans.
“Go in, then, Grimaud,” said Mousqueton, handing him the beer pot and gimlet.
“Good,” he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so powerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him.
And the musketeer rose, grumbling, took his sword, hat, pistols, and cloak, and followed the officer, whilst Porthos, alone and sole possessor of the bed, endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep, which his predecessor had set him.
“I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.
“Believe me,” continued Tréville, “in enterprises of this kind, in order that one may arrive, four must set out.”
The Monk.
Villefort rose, half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
“Care not for me, sire; think only of yourself.
“I believe I did.”
“But you, I presume, have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce?”
Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness?”
What have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to make an accusation of passing false money?”
He entered with a tolerably dignified step, and some little haste.
I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually, and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship, the _Pharaon_, did not come into port on the 15th, he would be wholly unable to make this payment.”
“Yes, you will live!”
VOLUME TWO
At the same moment Mordaunt, for it was he, leveled his pistol at Winter; it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier, who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos, murmuring: “He is avenged!”
There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted.
“But the child—the child, sir?” repeated the agitated mother.
Love.
You are right—he is worth us all, and we avow it to you!”
Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it.
“Well, we will go by the Corso.
“Porthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,” replied Aramis.
It was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal.
This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.
He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf, and ranks among the peers.”
“We took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission.”
This time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted.
Adieu!
D’Artagnan, as we have said, perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase.
Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up by his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations.
This was a great affront to the king’s army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no longer, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII.

“All day?”
He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumetto.
On D’Artagnan’s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul—the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life’s disillusions.
The poor woman’s head and arms fell; her legs bent under her, and she fell on her knees.
“Very good, very good!
“Peppino,” said the brigand chief, “give me the torch.”
He shall go thither.”
The matter being thus decided, the two friends found, about two hundred paces further, the tavern indicated.
In the first place, I was four years making the tools I possess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen.
One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying.
“It is strange,” said Aramis.
Why buy what one can take?”
“Probably.”
The harlequin had reassumed her peasant’s costume, and as she passed she raised her mask.
You, a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman!
To prison with him!
Bonacieux, who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband.
“Come in, my lord,” said Philip in a low tone, “and I will show you something droll.” Morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he saw some playing-cards fixed against the wall.
The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with their trembling wings.
He was thinking of Mme.
“It has hesitated at nothing in the past; why, then, should it be less daring in the future?”
Then, as I believed my husband would be at home, I hastened hither.”

“Do you say as a monk?”
“Withdraw, sir,” said Buckingham, “or I will call my attendant, and have you placed in irons.”
“You know him, then?”
and his predecessors; and he saw that the complement was not half empty.
one can no more now reckon on one’s friends than on one’s footmen,” said Porthos.
For my own part, I have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles.
“Don’t stir,” whispered Monte Cristo, “and put down your hatchet; we shall require no arms.”
Well, then, at the end of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water.”
Franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father’s death, which had hitherto been a mystery.
Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel, in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity.
“No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, _La Gironde_; she comes from India also; but she is not mine.”
Chapter 54.
“I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty.
“Nothing but one word!” said D’Artagnan.
“Could you engage to bring him to me to-morrow morning at ten o’clock, on the Pont du Louvre?”
“Yes,” said the queen; “but his son?”
He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell.
And how does France appear in your eyes, accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?”
I cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends, one whom you all know—poor Franz d’Épinay.”
“But,” Blaisois ventured to say, “I have heard you relate, Monsieur Mousqueton, that once on a time, at Chantilly, you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare, carp with a line, and bottles with a slipnoose.”
That knife was for you, my lad; she would have killed you.
Anne followed him with her eyes, and as he withdrew, at every step he took, a disdainful smile was seen playing, then gradually burst upon her lips.
“Yes,” said Noirtier.
D’Artagnan took possession of his command.
At this moment a horse without a rider, covered with foam, his nostrils extended and eyes all fire, galloped up, and recognizing his master, stopped and neighed with pleasure; it was Arthur.
“What do they say?”
The peasant, the gardener, was Rochefort, whom he believed to be in the Bastile.
If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
But hear me,” continued she.
D’Artagnan alone had discovered nothing—he, ordinarily the most inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him.
“A sailor.”

“Ah!
A worthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married, and securing her a position.
“Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.”
“Edward,” cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up from the floor, “do you hear me?—Go!”
“The fact is, we, that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I, hesitated a little.”

Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away.
Well, monsieur, I am at your service.”

‘What is the matter, dear grandfather?’ said I, ‘are you pleased?’ He gave me a sign in the affirmative.
THE RENDEZVOUS
“How could this ring come into the hands of Milady Clarik?
“Oh, but that is dreadful!
Oh, am I happy enough for that?”
“I assure you, I shall be very much in the way in that little boat,” said Mousqueton.
“But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father.”
“Ah, your pardon,” said Albert, turning round; “will you allow me, captain?”
“Of whom I bought her,” said Monte Cristo, “as I told you, Albert, with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills.”
You can’t imagine, my dear fellow, the sort of man he is.
Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey’s visits.
Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords; he felt it was no longer to be a butchery, but a fight, and he resumed his usual good humor.
He placed his hand on his dagger and stopped.
Remain neutral monseigneur, if you find that I act as becomes a gallant man.”
Albert understood the allusion in a moment, and was about to throw his glove at the count, when Morrel seized his hand, while Beauchamp and Château-Renaud, fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge, held him back.
M. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further; but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon Porthos, he contented himself with saying, “Monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?”
And, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat, stole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain.
“Alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “I have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it.
Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend.
“Oh, yes it is you indeed!
His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start.
“Your horse, seven against eight; a point short—you know the proverb.”
“You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here—more than many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his country, obtains.
Monsieur de Mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to General Cromwell, instead of King Charles, which would have been a disgrace, rebounding from us to him, and from him to your majesty—a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son.
“Certainly it is not mine.”
“Yes, if it isn’t contrary to the rules.”
“Here he is.”
d’Épinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with pleasure, at least with indifference.”
“What do you mean?”
He is moving; and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to see.
At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner.
They who love believe easily in love.

And to all these questions poor Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark, solely because happiness is egotistical.
How, sometimes, the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence.
“Exactly.”

“My dear Count,—When one travels, and especially for three months, one never has a superfluity of money.
“I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation.”
“Fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven.”
She howled as the hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature, which also seemed to groan with despair.
But I must see him instantly.”
Your brother-in-law is a barrister?
“True,” said M. d’Avrigny; “we will return.”
“Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them aright.
Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn, a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn.
“In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.”
Chapter 16.
There D’Artagnan was asleep upon a bench.
However, you may look and see,” added the lackey, raising the curtained entrance of the tent.
Giovanni obeyed.
Now, I cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.”
I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place, nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us, but our estates are confiscated, our ready money is exhausted, and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess.
I?
That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping him—a stranger to your country—with arms, with money or with troops.
“What is it?” asked D’Artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend.
I entreat you to write to me, for you form a part of my existence, and, if I may venture to tell you so, I also feel anxious.
“I suffer from emotion?” said Monte Cristo.
“Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those three million?”
La Ramee made one movement, in order to satisfy his conscience.
Baptistin entered, and remained standing at the door.
As soon as that important business is concluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars.”
Set out for Naples, the Hague, or St. Petersburg—calm countries, where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot-headed Parisians.
He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy.
“What sort of a man is he?”
“Death alone can separate them,” remarked Fernand.
“No.” said Villefort; “fetch the nearest.”
She has experienced much anxiety; but she is now at length a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly.
“Ah!” said D’Artagnan, who began to understand.
“Why, you know I told you,” replied Danglars, “that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance.”
“Yes,” echoed Porthos, glancing affectionately at his sword, still hanging on the wall; “we can wait for him; let him come.”
“But it was my husband who would not hear of lending.”
Danglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate.
This evening, then, at a quarter to nine at the gate.
“Yes, that disturbs you?”
“Yes, yes, to be sure, Kitty,” said D’Artagnan; “be at ease, my girl.
If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,—for my fortune is theirs—before me they were nothing—after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity—ineptitude!

It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher.
My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain.
However much of a Jew he may be, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles.

His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer, who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.”
He went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road, but Gondy reflected for a moment, and then said:

A vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed.
Aramis immediately complied, and sang the song in a very lively manner.
“Now escort me.”

Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke.
When at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn, a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath; then, fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular expression, the dying man uttered the last death-rattle and expired.

Monte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say, “God is for and with me.” With an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt its pulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine’s room, of which he double-locked the door.
“You do wrong.”
“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said Villefort:

“Is he then so ill, dear Voiture?” asked Aramis, half hidden by the window curtain.
The procureur shook his head.

From two o’clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the _fête_, exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and the pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses’ feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.
Go; make out my bill and notify my servant.”
One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever.
“I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has put above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow out, instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your narrow, limited field of observation.

He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street.
“I have something important to reveal to him.”
Have you lost your heart?”

He is a priest, learned in cases of conscience, and we will tell him ours.”
“Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator’s wife, and not to say a word of the wound?”

“You are very kind, but I may be prevented.”
I have touched the hand of the great man!” cried Bonacieux.

Chapter 8.
“Quite possible, sir; do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to headquarters.”

The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.

We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to Flanders.

We say _almost_, for the idea that a young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary strengthens it.

“Ah,” said Villefort, smiling, “I confess I should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me.”
You are not judges!
The two men remained opposite one another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity.

“She departed last night.”
At this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head, but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.
The host insisted; but the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.
Can it be with me?
“My wife escaped!” cried Bonacieux.
“Bah!” said he, “I have travelled through Sicily and Calabria—I have sailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate.”

“That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to take my bank-notes.”
He remembers that I saved his life, and as he has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders.”
The four friends were reunited.
The old man’s interrogative eye said, “Which?”
He had thought the king and queen charming at the ball.

Bonacieux pushed a little servants’ door, open by day but generally closed at night.
If I am a prisoner, what crime have I committed?”

“Speak, monsieur, speak,” said D’Artagnan, who instinctively scented something advantageous.
Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of Waterloo?
“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely.
“I?”
Faith, you are indeed right not to return to it.
“Monsieur still insists upon seeing him?”
You will tell him, in order that he may not doubt, that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul, which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn, and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles.”
Chapter LXII.
I am quite resigned.
Milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without uttering a word.

“This cannot be Monsieur Porthos,” observed Planchet replying, as it were, to his master’s thoughts.
“Oh, madame!” cried the young woman, falling on her knees; “upon my soul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!”
“My lord, to a well-bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track; he is certain to reach the other.”
“King’s Musketeers,” said Athos, more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so.
“True,” said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, “true, if this person were not on his guard, as he is;” and he added with a smile, “He will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.” At these words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went towards a table on which lay his son’s toilet articles, lathered his face, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising whiskers.
Bonacieux—he ran, full of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before, but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied.
I know a clever person at Tours—”

“See, I have not slept,” said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed; “grief does not stun me.
What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor.
“Come,” said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed back to its original situation, “let me hear your story.”
“The postscript is explicit.”
“How so?”
“_Quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_.”
“And that man, what has your Eminence done with him?”
My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September—that is to say, precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life—the Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire.

Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de Longueville?”
“Yes.”
He arrived; Valentine was expecting him.
“Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing Andromeda.”
Then put down three hundred livres,” said the procurator’s wife, with a sigh.
“And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness?”
Porthos, kill every one who stands in your way.”
The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word—his majesty’s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort was introduced.
“Yes; go.”
How?
‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘does it still displease you that I should frequent a certain house of La Rue Payenne?
The magistrate was seated in an armchair, writing, with his back towards the door; he did not move as he heard it open, and the door-keeper pronounce the words, “Walk in, madame,” and then reclose it; but no sooner had the man’s footsteps ceased, than he started up, drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and examined every corner of the room.
“Do you think so?”
“A country clown,” said Anne of Austria, “people will laugh.”
D’Artagnan started.
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.
What say you to that crime, of which I have the proof?”
The concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind.
“What for, Philip?” asked Albert, who, being a constant visitor there, did not understand this opposition to his entrance.
“Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened.

Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring any suspicion.
The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my relations.”
The officer followed her.
A detachment of carbineers, fifteen abreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the _barberi_.
“My patron died.
“Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair?”
Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then explained to him what I wished to procure.
“But you were speaking of Haitians?” said Monte Cristo.
“On whose side?” asked Athos, fixing his clear, benevolent glance on the countenance of the Gascon.
“To prepare her system to resist poison?”
“Well, for my part,” said Athos, “I found Aramis’s Spanish wine so good that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys.
“It was necessary; my man was going to fire a pistol at me; but you—how did you get rid of yours?”
“Do you know the numbers?”
He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread:
“Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business?”
“And on what account?”
“You will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if you wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone.
“Return whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that poor kickshaw!
When were you here?”

“Who has given them to us?” said Porthos.
The boy found him sitting where D’Artagnan had left him, still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary.
“Humph,” said Morcerf, “this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.”
“Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?” asked the young man, withholding his arm.
As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre, to meet again beyond St. Denis—a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results.
At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger’s face, while his own remained obscured.
Anne of Austria ran to her jewel case.
May I reckon on you as an auxiliary?”
He returned thus, formidable and implacable, advancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general, who could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him again, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him, drew back, and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand.
“Well, now,” she said, “let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak.”
“The father’s?”
And you?”
“Impossible!
de Morcerf’s, who is deceased.”
Both resumed their way.
“You will know presently, my friend.”
Conspiracy Chapter 5.
The jailer, therefore, only grumbled.
“But where is Athos now?” cried D’Artagnan.
“Is the conference ended?” asked Eugénie, rising.
I only know it says, ‘Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods, nor yet his wife.’”
“All right.” And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise.
“It is evident, by their sending for me, that matters are becoming complicated.
I am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter.
At daybreak I left the chamber without noise, leaving my charming companion asleep.
“Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace,” said Aramis.
“Murder!
A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance.
Mark!
“But the king—where is the king?” exclaimed Athos, anxiously.
When I returned to Paris, I learned that you, the widow of M. de Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.
And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably, not toward London, where D’Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going, but to Durham, whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne, and accompany us to the royalist camp, on this side of the Tyne, near Newcastle.
This man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman, had become an admirable jailer.
“But,” cried Felton, “that is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there.”
He had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals.
And moreover, in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves.
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain, and drank it.
If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view.
“Oh, no, not at all, vicomte,” Athos replied; “he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him.”
Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you.

That French officer——”
“Better; but do you think that we’ve got them this time?”
Which was the real delinquent?”
The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous Gascon.
“I’faith, no,” said D’Artagnan; “I was not in voice; Monsieur du Vallon has a cold and did not cry either.
“I do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.”
“When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress.”
Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile.
“Possibly,” continued Aramis, “came toward me, accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest tone, ‘Monsieur Duke,’ said he to me, ‘and you madame,’ continued he, addressing the lady on my arm—”
“Thank you, I have just returned from sea.”
“No.”
He commanded a retreat, which began, step by step, foot by foot; unhappily, in an instant he fell, mortally wounded.
“No Count of Monte Cristo” added Debray.
The figure put the comb in its pocket.
Shake hands—I crave your friendship.”
“Sire, you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to, therefore gratitude is on our side.
“You are not a priest!” cried the executioner.
Grimaud had, indeed, during twenty-two years of service, seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athos’s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy.
The next day must clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend, the Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring of Gyges, and by its power was able to render himself invisible, it was very certain he could not escape this time.
You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!”
At the banker’s door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf.
“My dear Franz,” replied Albert, “when, upon receipt of my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count’s assistance, you promptly went to him, saying, ‘My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to deliver him.’ Was not that nearly what you said?”
“‘Denaro e santità,
Danglars meditated an escape; but the walls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed.
“Ah!” cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.
“‘Here,’ said he, to Cucumetto, ‘here are three hundred piastres; give me back my child.
“Permit me to inform you, Count,” said he, bowing, “that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.”
What is it?”
“What?”
“Not at all.
“See,” said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray.
“Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”
The quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily:
“Why, really, it was all exactly as you say!” cried Madame de Chevreuse, clapping her hands.
Where are your Musketeers?
Besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot to risk our lives; but _she_,” asked he, in an undertone.
This winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which the young girl had bought a fortnight before.
“I understand,” said he, “perfectly.”
“I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a count, so that he is not one at all.”
Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain.”
At these words there appeared in Noirtier’s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there: “You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.”
And besides, he considered it most expedient, without exhibiting too much ill-will, to follow to the end his role as confessor.
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape.
“Yes, count,” replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.
“Because it is for victors to make conditions, and you are not yet victors, gentlemen.”
to saddle!
“I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.”
This Andrea was a wretch, a robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable name.
“Go; and where shall I find you?”
Mother Nanette!”
“To do her violence, without doubt,” said Athos.
Stop a moment; does not that sunbeam yonder, just by the side of the town, glitter on the Ironsides?”
“No, no; thanks.
“I told you this, I am now grieved I have kept my word.
Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile.
Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”
It is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere.
“Why?”
“Quite a canoe.”
“It is not a question of the past, but of the present,” said the queen; “you said you could give me advice—what is it?”
Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and showed her two immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants, of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce.
“Yes, sir, provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end I wish to attain—I mean, the remission of my sins.”
“And why not?” asked the young man.
We are not such devils as we appear to be.
The monk recovered his usual expression.
“And do you comprehend, Grimaud?” said Aramis.
“The marshal.”
“That is to say, you don’t believe what I have told you; is it not so?”
M. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother.
After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the door, crying out:
He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling, but a sort of buffoon, a punchinello, a pantaloon.
“The headsman of Bethune?” exclaimed De Winter.
you’ve missed me,” cried Aramis, “but I swear to Heaven!
“The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart, for whom, I hope, you’re preparing a pretty trial.”
Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”
“Why, he would be annoyed if I did not play with him.”
Monsieur de Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province, and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter.
Those who took me from my father, and who always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original proprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make the most of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth, and even to increase the value, if possible.
“Impossible; you are his confidant!”
“What for?”
“Saved?” repeated Morrel, not being able to conceive such intense happiness; “by whom?”
“The next day Mercédès came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent.
Robert Macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas—“Chien de Montargis” and “Chien d’Aubry”—and the name is applied to bold criminals as a term of derision.
“Give your orders,” said the three musketeers.
But all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought, the countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by degrees, and recovered perfect serenity.
“What then?”
“Be,” said the letter, “on Thursday next, at from six to seven o’clock in the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the carriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant.”
“Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box.
She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.
There was a moment’s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror.
“My dear Athos,” he said, “I am going away.
“Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me.
On the front of the monument was inscribed: “The families of Saint-Méran and Villefort,” for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée, Valentine’s mother.
“But,” said Andrea, ill-temperedly, “by my faith, if it was only to breakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil had taken you!”
The praise was well deserved, for had not the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which he knew everything, the baron’s countenance would not have led him to suspect it.
“Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,” interrupted Aramis.
D’Artagnan, as he crossed the Pont Neuf, congratulated himself on having found Planchet again, for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him; nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the situation which he held in Rue des Lombards, a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced, at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party.
?”
And Athos?”
The beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance.
Then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless, remarked in him, “There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.” And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris.
“Don’t speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word brings back my mother to my recollection—my angel mother, who died too soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven.
Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois, the only serving-man whom he had left.
“And the other?” asked Athos.
“If, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M. Cavalcanti in that room, where he, the betrothed of Eugénie, has never been admitted.”
hi!” cried the steward; “the house servants, with the carbines!”
“Ha!
The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes.
“Everything, believe me.
“Father,” replied the child, “I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king.”
D’Artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question.
At length an old, worm-eaten shutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of D’Artagnan.
“That is to say,” replied Milady, driven into her entrenchment, “that I have not the honor of knowing her personally; but I know a great number of her most intimate friends.
My son, I bless thee!”
As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman.
I am rich enough, forsooth, to distribute his authority on this occasion.”
“You are right.
“The countess,” said Morcerf, “was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive.
“Pen, ink, and paper,” muttered Fernand.
This was not, however, a rope ladder, but a ball of silk cord, with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs, the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board.
“A lover is never terrible,” he said.
“Some grand personage—a prince I believe they said—the Count of Monte Cristo.”
“‘You persist, then?’
His guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise, and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress, while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind.
Tell the viscount so, and that tomorrow, before ten o’clock, I shall see what color his is.”
If I stay in Paris I cannot go to Rome; if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister; and it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur d’Artagnan a captain and Monsieur du Vallon a baron.”
“He knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from Paris.”
the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice, which naturally you took care not to adopt.”
“Monsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will.”
“Come, come,” said Maximilian, “I will serve as your guide; such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant.
“But another thing.”
“What is this?” said Aramis, on seeing them arrive.
Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians; D’Artagnan ate in silence, revolving in his mind the most audacious plans.
“That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself.” Albert smiled.
All this I did scrupulously.
“Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.”
“Ah, if I were in your place——” said Albert.
“True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.”
Paternal Affection.
“From the count!” murmured the two young people.
“Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?” asked another.

He might be recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman.
“Oh, how extraordinary!
“I expected this,” said Felton.
And you are going to Portsmouth?”
She listened at Eugénie’s door, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.
“Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of September at eleven o’clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven), I shall come to receive the money.”
“Yes, monsieur, quite ready,” said Bazin; “but it took me some time to bring up all the——”
“Yes.”
While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking dreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of Providence.
“I believe,” said Raoul, “that I have got something like a scratch on the arm.
“Indeed?” said Morrel.
“Faith!
Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximilian.
When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall.
You can see it in his eye.
There was profound silence.
Albert de Morcerf,” said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, “I cannot throw you out of window for three weeks—that is to say, for twenty-four days to come—nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed.
“Nothing more easy.”
“Now, sir,” said Albert, “if you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand.
“Shame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst!
I have since learned that he was confined in the Château d’If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his death.”
“Who is there?” answered the voice of her he sought.
“He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock, which hangs behind his uniform,” said another Musketeer.
“Relating to him?”
“If I am astonished at anything,” remarked Porthos, sententiously, “it is that it has not already happened.”
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame.
Peppino pretended not to hear him, and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly.
The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning, ‘The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!’”
As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”
What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go?”
Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss.
Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz.
“And what is the news?”
Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.”
He meets Albert de Morcerf in Italy—it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars—it is that he may give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his door—it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction.
“What?
“Egad!
“None.
Chapter XXX.
Is that your name, monsieur?”
He was, notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more serious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.
“Yes, go; but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity.
The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal.
Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought.
Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death?”
“Poor fools!” said Athos, emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys, merited it no less, “poor fools!
The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt.
After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man, who approached them, swimming vigorously.
Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of D’Artagnan, and even gave him her hand to kiss.
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket, and tying a knot at each corner—the signal agreed upon—waved it in the air and the man came up to him.
The poor duke swore, fell into a rage, yelled, and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior of Vendome; but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter.
“Nay, nay!” cried Caderousse, smiling, “you have not attained that honor yet.
“Mother,” said Albert with firmness.
“Dear D’Artagnan, dear Du Vallon, my good friends, perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me.
The footman went out.
“As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment.
Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor.
“Oh oh!” said Aramis, “there are questions between them at this very moment.
There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity; and I will say further—the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.”
“What are these things?” he asked.
One of the gates began to yield.
“Well, if you should be restored to favor, don’t forget me.”
I swear to Heaven, on the contrary, that if they fall upon him I will fall upon them.”
“If she objects to your marrying M. d’Épinay, she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition.”
“Because,” said Andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, “I thought I heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now.”
“Sir,” said M. Beauchamp, “Albert was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray so much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him.
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!)
He had the resolution to stop with this.
Instead of aiding the movements of my horse, I paralyzed them; and I was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world, when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water; therefore, sir, if you will agree, henceforward we are friends until death.”
“Ah, there!
For example, you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St. Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples.
Poor child!
“Ah, you surprise me.
“Dear Valentine!”
“How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight?
“Yes.”
“He will be here tonight.”

“Because tomorrow, Haydée, you will be free; you will then assume your proper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours.
“Yes, doubtless.”
“’Tis an illustrious name,” said the lieutenant, “and had one day triumphal honors paid to it.”
The man of superior abilities always finds admirers, go where he will.
Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary.
At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Cromwell.
At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her carriage, and went out.
“How can I?”
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement.
“Well, then, let us sup.”
Villefort, approached Noirtier.
“Are you at variance with the Englishman?”
Then I renewed the search.
“Holloa!” said he, “what does that mean?”
“Madame,” replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, “I have already had the honor to observe that my father has—at least, I hope so—abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order—a better royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse than warm, decided preference and conviction.” Having made this well-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court.
Everything is in readiness for our flight, and we can select any time we choose.
Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about.
for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her.”
“Certainly.”
“That he wouldn’t swear.”
You have restored my courage by a single word; go, I will rejoin you.”
“What would you have?” said the Musketeer.
He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s hand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles.
“I, my lord,” answered the Gascon, “I differ from Monsieur d’Herblay entirely as to the last point, though I agree with him on the first.
“Yes, it is indeed he.
“His talent?
Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream and a reality, between the project and the execution.
“I was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found my way into the apartment of some churchman.

“Come,” said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, “if I did not like you, do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me?
how lofty, how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day, when he said to his adversary: ‘You have insisted on knowing my name, sir; so much the worse for you, since I shall be obliged to kill you.’ I was near him, those were his exact words, when he stabbed his foe as he said he would, and his adversary fell without saying, ‘Oh!’ ’Tis a noble gentleman—Monsieur Athos.”
Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another, even if it were darker and deeper, for a change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford him some amusement.
Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him.
That evening Milady gave orders that when M. d’Artagnan came as usual, he should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.
Marseilles resounded with their well-earned praises.
His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had been.
These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle, and no doubt want to carry off the king.
“That is what deceives you, Debray.”
He rose gently, so that his head was just above the round of the barrel, and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mordaunt.
27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for your punctuality?”
It was not without foundation that a report of the king’s intention to leave Paris by night had been circulated.
“And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence?”
I am doing a little sum in arithmetic.”
That pretty little _soubrette_ whom D’Artagnan had already observed then came in.
“That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same.”
“For life,” replied Porthos, in the same manner.
“Alas, do you not know?”
He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.
I married that woman when she was a young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family; I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that this woman was branded—this woman was marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ on her left shoulder.”
In that case I will forgive him.”
He recalled his arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a spoonful of hashish.
“’Twas that low fellow, Bonacieux.”
Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition.
When I came to myself again, I was stretched in the same place.
Morrel attributed Penelon’s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he was, no doubt, engaged on board some other vessel, and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having, if we may so express ourselves, worn mourning for the _Pharaon_ longer.
“Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too?
In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone, whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by D’Artagnan and Porthos.
If you do not come across one, return for me.” The patron shook his head.
You say M. Danglars dined here?”
Who knows but that, in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in his power?
CAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY Chapter LIII.
“Who is this officer,” inquired Raoul of Athos, “who is speaking?”
She was in a little boudoir, hung with blue damask, adorned by red flowers, with a foliage of gold, looking upon a garden; and reclined upon a sofa, her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it.
“No.
“They are coming, full gallop; the prince is with them—ah!
Mousqueton is propped against the door and here’s the key.”
Was it the Englishman who carried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?”
But instead of going to her own room, Valentine, having once gained her liberty, entered the gallery, and, opening a small door at the end of it, found herself at once in the garden.
“He!” cried Albert; “yes, it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred.
“My lord,” said the guard, “I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel, who believes that, be he ever so closely watched and guarded, the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsuntide.”
“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man.
“‘Down with Mazarin!’ I’faith, the treasonable word is out.”
The surgeon declared that the situation of the Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.
A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent.
King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy.
It is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls; he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him, and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante-chamber.
“To come back and besiege Rueil.”
A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée, seemed one of fire and blood.
“Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what I have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of——”
There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the spot where he sat.
This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.”
“My word,” said de Winter, rising, “I think the hussy is going mad!
On their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochellais.
Now you are a man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert, be prudent.”
“He expected, you will remember, to be here on the fifth.”
We therefore represent six fighting men; if we should meet a little troop of enemies, equal or even superior in number to our own, shall we charge them, Raoul?”
Why, it was he who carried me off!”
“Are you ready, sir?” he said at last.
Poor lad!
“And in three months’ time,” said Albert, “you will be at my house?”
“And what did he do the rest of his time?”
“Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it!
“Oh!
“When you please,” said D’Artagnan.
My mother tried to force the door, that she might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside.
“Madame,—Being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself, by reason of a wound I have received in my right hand, I have commanded my son, the Count de Guiche, who, with his father, is equally your humble servant, to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of Lens, and that this victory cannot fail to give great power to Cardinal Mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of Europe.
The count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.
One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor.
He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey, and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy.
an affair for the police!
“He shall die, then, since you condemn him!” said D’Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.
The queen smiled.
“Exactly so,” said the young men; “you have probably guessed right.”
“But you receive him at your house?”
“Eh, your excellency?
“My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed—he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us.
He proceeded slowly and in deep reverie.
Valentine instinctively raised her eyes, as if to thank heaven.
“You child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do, that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress.”
Thank him, then, madame, if you have any affection for me.”
“Is this the man?” asked the captain, who was attentively reading Plutarch’s _Life of Alexander_.
With this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of D’Artagnan.
Since his majesty still lives, since the honor of the throne is safe, everything else is a matter of indifference to me.”
Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be silent.
Chapter 85.
“Well,” said Porthos, “it appears to me that the means are very simple.”
Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais Royal, the cardinal knocked at a little door, and after thanking D’Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal, he made a sign to Guitant to follow him.
It was Planchet, who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont.
Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor.
“Yes, my lord.”
At this moment the door was opened, and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner.
Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick; after which ebullition he departed—not, however, without walking several times to the door of the press-room, as if he had half a mind to enter.
“Whenever her majesty has need of me,” replied the coadjutor, bowing, “her majesty knows I am at her command.”
Mme.
I will not attempt to argue with you, but I blame you.”
“Madame will be tired tonight,” continued Monte Cristo, “and will, no doubt, wish to rest.
Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart, tragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly.”
Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.
From their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by Albert de Morcerf reading _Cæsar’s Commentaries_, and by Danglars studying the _Life of Alexander_.
“To what?”
“Impossible!
About seven o’clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty.
“And upon what then must I live?
“You, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried Grimaud, “impossible.”
“‘I believe the storm is over,’ said he.
“So sick that he is dying, and he wants to confess to the coadjutor, who, they say, has power to remit great sins.”
Madame de Villefort, who was in very good spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but Mademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth, notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her like a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.”
That, however, does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service, as I am to that of your majesty.”
I am dead drunk, that’s all, and never did a man more strongly set about getting so.
In the anteroom, Valentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant.
An apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini’s hotel.
“Tell me, may I shake hands with you, saying, ‘Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured me, and retain my friendship,’ or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms?”
“_Pardieu!_” said Athos, “it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.
“Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things?
Dantès, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him.
30327m
The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but Porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator’s wife was obliged to give place to the king.
These individuals are under arrest.
“You are right—that is the principle on which I wish to act.”
“Very well, take Blaisois, with whom I know not what to do, since I already have Grimaud.”
Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him, he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged, in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies.
“Be it so.
“Hush!” said La Ramee; and one by one he sent away the guards, on various pretexts.
“Has any horse got loose?”
The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert’s prison, and Franz and the count followed him.
The Swiss, with an air of stupefaction, looked at the hostess, who turned pale.
Be easy, I am a gentleman.
The king turned quickly around, with tears in his eyes and heart.
God forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account!
Albert entered, looking very handsome and in high spirits.
“Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.”
“I never lie, madame.”
“Buckingham, the executioner of this angelic creature!” cried Felton.
She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago.
“Yes, I recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot sleep: ‘Strike, save England, save thyself—for thou wilt die without having appeased God!’ Speak, speak!” cried Felton, “I can understand you now.”
“Yes, madame, he shall live,” said Monte Cristo, surprised that without more emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her.
“Yes, indeed, count,” said Madame Danglars; “and tell me, did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?”
“Have I not always fought for your glory and interests?”
The king smiled, patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle.
Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the _concierge_ that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them.
The father of M. de Tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money—a thing to which the Béarnais was accustomed all his life, and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit—in default of money, we repeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto _Fidelis et fortis_.
“To yours, monsieur.”
The next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening.
Chapter LXII.
“And La Ramee?”
“Stay,” said D’Artagnan, “and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door.”
“And who?” asked M. de Tréville.
“It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want.
Franz and Albert bowed.
The Dinner
The matter had been named to him by D’Artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the money to him, then the glory, and then the danger.
“If it were so,” answered Athos, “we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter, for he would come in for his share; he was one of us.”
The novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, “Don’t you know a gentleman named Athos?”
“Have you ever seen the Tuileries?”
“They are beating the rappel!” cried Chatillon; “we must discover what is going on.”
Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string.
Yes, I have said it and I now repeat it: our destinies are irrevocably united, although we now pursue divergent roads.
“Are you wounded?” cried Aramis.
It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la Fere.”
“Oh, chevalier!” cried the king, “what can I say to you?
Château-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other; the impression was the same on both of them, and the tone in which Morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.
my lord—who told you that?”
“Very well.” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars’ contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker’s wife should exercise in providing for the future.
A moment later Friquet went out, carrying in his hand a large leather bag; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold.
This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth.
The young man, wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M. Morrel in person.
But to return to our duchess.”
“And even for all day to-morrow, if you want it.
“All right, all right,” said the jailer; “all right, since you will have it so.
Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled and shook before the tempest.
“And what do you know about the state you talk of?” said Mme.
Four of the guards, who were constantly near the prisoner, assisted in picking up the tennis balls.
He had been known, in the circle of the Musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their pearly hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening, ceasing to be calm and agreeable.
The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which the sun glances obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity.
“Instead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself.
“Yes.”
“He showed it me; but that is not all—there is a codicil, as I said just now.”
Peppino passed, lighted his torch, and turned to see if they came after him.
I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times.
The young man’s trembling voice was scarcely audible.
As he had said, it had been a long time since any one had needed him; and that demand for his services on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign.
However, I’m glad not to fight them until to-morrow.
“And what of that?
“I shall be happy to do so; the morning air has made me hungry.”

“Yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop.”
THE WIFE OF ATHOS Chapter XXVIII.
One would think we had tipped the wink.”
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction.
“Madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille.”
Monte Cristo drew him in gently.
“I do not understand,” stammered Lucien.
“Well, you have an annuity.”
“Certainly,” continued Monte Cristo, “I make three assortments in fortune—first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes.
Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there.
The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight.
It was the evening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have lasted twenty-four hours!
“But if I were wrong——”
“Possibly.”
The editor was reading, with apparent delight, a leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a composition of his own.
I, the offspring of a noble family, who placed reliance upon your friendship—I was near dying of my wounds at first, and of hunger afterward, in a beggarly inn at Chantilly, without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters I addressed to you.”
A young priest, with a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the church of that convent.
“With you, sir,” replied the baroness, “one can wish for nothing, one is so sure to obtain it.
the _Pharaon_!” said every voice.
Danglars looked absolutely stupefied.
“_Avanti!_” said the same sharp and imperative voice.
You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre, that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made.
I am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force.
“What next?” asked Albert.
“With Madame Danglars?”
“My faith,” said Athos, “I have nothing to say against a retreat.
The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered from his captivity.”
Until to-morrow evening you are not at your own disposal.”
“My God, that’s all.
You are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my tastes, and am without passion, I hope.
“My God!
He will answer you.”
“I have ten left,” said the man, “for here are eleven, and I had twenty-one, five more than last year.
“Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very significant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad to see me?”
“’Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return.”
All this was answered by an expression of D’Artagnan’s.
He was, perhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a companion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity.
He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister.
By degrees everyone awoke.
“You have a good memory,” said Mazarin.
Remember, Raoul, this!
coward!”
But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same man.
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle.
When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists, it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass.
“Sword in hand!”
“I!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Mordaunt,” he said, “you are a terrible servant.”
Grimaud did not answer, but bowed a second time.
“The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.”
“Where is she?” asked Athos.
* A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.
The _mandaïa_6 never fails, never trembles, never strikes thirty times ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais, and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer.
You must not weep, no, you must not groan, you must tremble!”
Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from St.
“How do you know it?”
Let her do what she likes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.” And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass.
“Except that which I ask of you, dear love.”
A bed without curtains, four armchairs, and a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with a _prie-Dieu_, all its furniture.
“Now,” said D’Artagnan, “for the actual man.
They both mingled, as they had leave to do, with the servants and peasants.
My private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side.”
“My faith, monsieur, with great pleasure!
Noirtier gave his assent.
“And where is this man?”
“Fortune has been kind to you, then?
“You are sure it is not he?” said she.
“A man who has pursued her a long time.”
Pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were you a priest I should not dare tell you that, but you are a man, and you know mankind.
Everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle.
“I understand; and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a certain place?”
I have not said adieu to him!”
She wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling, awaited D’Artagnan’s reply.
we are coming to your aid.”
With him they will be gentle and docile as lambs.”
We were able to prove the contrary, and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty, calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre, where your royal munificence has provided for her a home.
Now, on such a day I can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten.
“You see,” said he, calling D’Artagnan’s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour’s walk, “we have made a tour of my domains.”
He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper from the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh.
The Count of Monte Cristo had just entered.
Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century.
“I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.”
“What do you mean?—of whom do you speak?
She is some emissary of the cardinal; a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head.”
What I most loved after you, Mercédès, was myself, my dignity, and that strength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my life.
Your kind attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her.
He was dressed with all the English peculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee.
“Is your jailer gone?”
Chapter VII.
I tell you I am going to die—do you understand?
But D’Artagnan had now slipped through the window.
‘You cannot go wrong—the road is bordered by trees on both sides.’
Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at Jussac?”
Speak, then, I beg of you; I wait and listen.”
“Ah,” said Morcerf, “I see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted.
“What are you looking at?” asked D’Artagnan.
“To obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed.
“What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?”
My friend, Monsieur du Vallon, is of a very melancholy disposition, so much so, that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day.
“He is afraid I have come to borrow money,” thought D’Artagnan.
you are not wrong after all, and life is sweet.
Mordaunt followed the carriage, and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended, and remained motionless, amidst the moldings of Jean Goujon, like a bas-relievo, representing an equestrian statue.
“And you were deceived, my dear sir,” replied Aramis, coldly, very little sensible to the reparation.
how can you tell me that?”
And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Château-Renaud, leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.
D’Artagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily, when an idea came into his head which silenced him.
To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king’s ransom in his waistcoat pocket.
There are yet five days left; five days are more than I require.
You met him at a dinner party at my house, and you introduced yourself at his house; that is a totally different affair.”
“By the way, M. de Château-Renaud,” asked Beauchamp, “how is Morrel?”
Toward six o’clock M. de Tréville announced that it was time to go to the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was past, instead of claiming the _entrée_ by the back stairs, he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber.
D’Artagnan, meantime, pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression.
“You say so.”
“Madame Bonacieux!” murmured D’Artagnan.
Has the law any eyes to witness your grief?
That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin; he fell into meditation.
“Therefore, my dear Mr. O’Reilly, you are my prisoner.
Monte Cristo wrote:
Oh, I am dying!” He again fainted.
Now, my lord, he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony.”
The host obeyed.
The queen saw this, and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion, for addressing Raoul again:
“I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell it.
“Granted; but if you please, let us not theologize, Aramis.
We can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs.
The recent events, the solitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost incredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum.
“I have my pride for men—serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot.
The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all, for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening, and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them.
Only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering.”
It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord.
A door opened, through which the attendant and the baron disappeared.
“Now,” said the unknown to Franz, “I do not know if you are of my opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another.
He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the steps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias.
“Impossible?
“On honor?”
“‘That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.’
The king was not mistaken.
And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there?
And they walked on again.
“What do you want, M. Bertuccio?” said he.
Upon that, Athos yielded.
“I will think of Maximilian!”
And Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said:
The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne, in the environs of that city.”
The count sat down.
This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantès, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially.
He was discovered; all hope of flight was gone.
“Are we to pass the night in the king’s room?” asked D’Artagnan.
“But you told me the island was uninhabited?”
“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”
Do you know what gave him strength?
“Take notice, captain,” he continued, giving Planchet his expected title, “take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen.”
Turning to his friend:
It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from Buckingham.
Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow, and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.
“Porthos?”
“Yes, ’tis given.
“But,” argued Porthos, “I speak French and they are all English.”
Consequently, the procureur is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police very much interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which I am very grateful, they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood, under pretence of their being Caderousse’s murderers, so that in three months, if this continues, every robber and assassin in France will have the plan of my house at his fingers’ ends.
Cries were heard from the interior, of which they could not comprehend the sense.
“Go!
“Thank you for the compliment, my young friend,” replied Aramis, “we can see from whom you learned courtesy.
“Shall I give you the change, my officer?” said the host.
The idiot!”
“And when you know, will you tell me?”
The story has been told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated it.
D’Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together to the tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux, who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life, and M. de la Trémouille, who had nothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his hôtel.
“Monday next!
“If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,” said Albert, “I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least.
“Married?”
“Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness.
“This is not his writing!” said Athos.
“Yes, you know the amount.”
“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here,” replied the count.
Now four days had elapsed, and Valentine still lived.
The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists, come and say, ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;’ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize twenty.
“Yes, to go and meet him.”
“Well?” asked the two gendarmes.
“Why bind thee?”
Have I travelled in that country?
“An infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!”
“There appeared in his journal last night—but wait, and read for yourself.” And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as follows:
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “no divided attention, I beg; let each one pick out his man.”
A man arrived yesterday from Yanina, bringing a formidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other paper.”
The host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger.
“Yes, truly; and I assure you.
“Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too.”
“Well, read the letter again.
“Instantly, monseigneur.” And Rochefort went hastily out of the apartment.
Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat.
“Oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!” said Caderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.
“Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so much the better, that is all.”
Fortunately, however, he had not been taken; the people, believing that he had escaped by some back entrance, retired and left him at liberty to retreat.
“Have you not thought so?”
“And now I look very much like a man who is going to be murdered.”
“One, two, three, four, five,” said Monte Cristo; “five millions—why what a Crœsus you are!”
At this very moment the court is making overtures to me; hitherto I have repulsed them; but since such men as you assure me that I am wrong in doing so, I’ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the Duc de Chatillon just now.”
that is no impediment, sir,” said she; “I have had greater men than you arrested—Guitant!”
He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman.
M. de la Trémouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts, which recalled him to life.
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage.
“In the stable.”
The Countess G—— insists upon it that he is a vampire.”
His hands, of which he took little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil.
“Adores it.”
“Well,” said he, “was I mistaken?”
“Yes,” the Gascon answered; “Athos!
The cavalier entered the second hall, which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers.
“Yes.”
My brother is only your second husband; and your first is still living.
Mine, also, are from him!”
in five minutes it will be too late!”
Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?”
“And as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own once, I estimated it at a thousand pistoles.”
Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!”
“Really, my dear count,” said Morcerf, “what I admire in you is, not so much your riches, for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself, nor is it only your wit, for Beaumarchais might have possessed as much,—but it is your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in a second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness.”
Your swords are in the corner; do not forget them, they are in many circumstances very useful; there is Porthos’s purse, too.”
“How useless?” cried the president, “what do you mean?”
“Do you know,” said Franz, “I have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.”
“First, a thrust with the coadjutor, whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillet’s and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting me.”
We have parted company this long time; all three have left the service.”
“Do you hear?” interrupted D’Artagnan; “become a Frondist, my friend, belong to the Fronde, and remember that I fill the count’s place in everything;” and he jingled his money.
“What dreadful sufferings!” said Julie, remembering Valentine, but whom, with a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her brother.
we do what we can!” And she rushed out of the room.
He sent us home in his own carriage.
Teresa had yielded in spite of herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him.
“Come, I am growing an old woman!” said the duchess, pensively.
He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account.
“Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe?
Chapter XII.
27.”
“Nobody, by the faith of a gentleman.”
“Under what circumstances did we meet?” he asked again.
“Ah, ah!” said he, “she is asleep; that’s well.
Chapter V. The Gascon and the Italian.
“I found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while feigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.
From this point everything was a blank to Dantès—he knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned.
Coquenard, she could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband.
“No; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer talk, we rise to dissertation.
“Indeed,” said Porthos, looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away, “you are right, D’Artagnan; Mouston will do; Mouston has a very fine appearance.”
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS Chapter XII.
“Let us go, then,” said Franz, “since you wish it; but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso.
Go, and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this.”
D’Artagnan looked, and was seized with pleasure.
“Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the arena, ‘He who is about to die salutes you.’”
Planchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont regiment.
“You serve the cardinal?”
“Yes, at present,” continued Lord de Winter, “you will remain in this castle.
“But,” said Porthos, “I think I have an idea, in my turn.”
We have made a wager—a wager which could not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to divine the true cause.
I had provided myself with a dark lantern.
In two days, and by using up two or three horses (that’s nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at Béthune.
Rochefort obeyed and retired.
“A prisoner?” he reiterated.
“That’s all very simple,” said D’Artagnan; “I expected this letter.
Send him away and all will then be well.’”
Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but in vain—they opened again as soon as shut.
The count went to his _secrétaire_, opened it, and pulling out a drawer filled with gold, said to Franz, “I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself.”
“By Heaven!” cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife, and striking the count in the breast, “you shall disclose nothing, reverend sir!”
“What?
“That is well.”
At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean, D’Artagnan upset a man; it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on.
Ask them to sing one more song; it is so delightful to hear music in the distance, when the musicians are unrestrained by observation.”
“But don’t think yourselves in a better position than you are.
“Decidedly and honestly.”
“I know not if it is finished, my beloved child,” said Monte Cristo, taking the young girl’s hands; “but I do know you have nothing more to fear.”
The Island of Tiboulen
Just then the lamp again flickered; the noise startled Madame de Villefort, who shuddered and dropped the curtain.
“Athos!” repeated M. de Tréville himself.
“It is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe.
Kitty will conduct you to my chamber.”
D’Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion, turned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation, and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his hand towards the young man.
“No; what I say,” replied Bonacieux, “is only that I may know whether I am delaying you.”
“I know something of diamonds; I have had some.”
“Then I understand it all!
“No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers.”
“This young man must not, however, fail in his duty,” said Athos.
This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects—fallen from her high estate.”
1.B.
“Indeed?” said Albert.
He was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he had not slept.
“Just so.
His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm, but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped.
No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way.
“Without revealing himself?”
“Are you not married?” asked the countess.
Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard.
“But where is Madame de Longueville?”
“And how much did they possess?”
“Cardinal, desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court.”
“And is that all—is that all?” replied Buckingham, impatiently.
“They do, indeed.
However,” he added, turning to Porthos, “I should not regret dying, sir, were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to you.”
On leaving Paris, Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger; but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger.
“Gentlemen,” said Château-Renaud, “it is not Morcerf coming in that carriage;—faith, it is Franz and Debray!”
“Whenever it shall please your Majesty; but I shall be always happy and proud, sire, to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see reign between you and the Queen of France.”
Remember that.”
“Is this corpse come to life already?
Your doors are guarded, the airholes of your cellars are guarded, and I could say to you, as that good La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort, you must be either bird or mouse to get out.”
“Very well.
He would never think of faring in the same manner as his master; he only drank from the cask.
“Zounds!” replied D’Artagnan, “why don’t you give yourself up directly, feet and hands bound, to that wretch?
He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre, but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen, attended by more than five hundred men.
“By the queen’s almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,” said Aramis, coloring.
All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off.
“His hatred of the king, who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De Winter.”
“I thought, I must confess, that these tales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.”
“Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is to see everything.
“Well,” said he to Morcerf, “but I think your father will not be the only angry one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered person.
Ah, but what is the matter with your hand, D’Artagnan?
We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all; Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies.
It is not a man, then, but some angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good.”
This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin.
I have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts.
The general, who had almost fainted, revived.
In the chamber of D’Artagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged.
What object, think you, have this expedition to Ré and this league with the Protestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting?
“No, let us belong to no party, but remain friends; let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists.”
0029m
“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you yet.”
“Five or six days hence at the latest.”
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed in sign of assent.
“Entirely so, my dear D’Artagnan.”
Those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm?
“I did.”
A woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him.
“Then, put me to the proof.”
Bonacieux.
“And yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind.
“Our conditions said, ‘No revenge,’ you will please to recollect.”
“And don’t forget,” said D’Artagnan, “to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two English gentlemen.”
Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far, said:
“I must have left it in my room,” she said.
“Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepelini.”
“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from anyone.”
But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell’s.
“And if I give you this password,” said she, “would you forget it as soon as you used it?”
“Because I was shown up the private stairs.”
No object affects me; and I even feel here, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you.
And taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining room; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade.
Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment!”
Villefort, thunderstruck, fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother.
He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which, mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling.
“Come, then,” said the prince; “let us lose no time.”
The queen read it, recognized the writing, and, since there were no details in it of what had occurred, asked for particulars.
The dog shook his head.
We shall descend by the first window in the gallery.”
“How do you mean?” said Valentine, looking anxiously around.
“Oh, for me; that is another matter.
Has not some sage said, ‘Nothing too much’?
“Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a material form.
“I swear I will, by Heaven.”
“Humph,” murmured Athos, “it is certainly she!”
It was on Thursday, the abbé’s reception day; people went there in crowds.
He raised him, almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture, at the risk of flaying him in the passage.
What could I do for you, Edmond, besides pray and weep?
“Then,” answered Albert, “I am better informed than you are, and know who the owner of that horse was.”
“Well, this surprises me, for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!”
The clerks gone, Mme.
“Will she permit it?”
Now, as I dislike him, and hope his railway, his electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin him, I am watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.”
D’Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative.
“It is well,” said Haydée; “your order shall be executed, my lord; I will forget even your name, and be happy.” And she stepped back to retire.
“D’Artagnan, monsieur.”
“Who, then, am I?”
“Well, sir,” said Danglars, “in case your proposals, which do me honor, are accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled?
D’Artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all his voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from Paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his master instantly.
“Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign, with full license and privilege.”
Noirtier looked at the dictionary.
“A fallen prince!” exclaimed Mazarin, piteously.
The prince, who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill-bred fellow, made out a list, against the grain, and sent it.
And Eugénie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and read:
“No.”
This way!
I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her.
“Ah!
Our blow has failed for to-night; let us withdraw.
“Thank you, La Ramee,” said the prisoner.
“Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner?”
In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well as I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in politics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.
Yes, the Marechal de Grammont is right; this will change the aspect of French affairs, but I much fear it will do nothing for English, even if it does not harm them.
Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I don’t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during the year.
30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.
I have answered for you.
D’Artagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple—on the contrary, thanking his Majesty greatly.
“True, on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest.”
He had only to step over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in his arms, and flee far, far away.
“I don’t know English, Athos,” said D’Artagnan; “but you know it and will interpret for me.”
You can’t think how I have missed him, the great simpleton.
Do you know that, monsieur?”
“Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses, ready saddled.”
“The usurper converted!”
No.
My hôtel will be always open to you.
I love you so tenderly that I cannot help being jealous, even of the past.”
“Do so.”
But it was too late.
“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your mind?”
“Pardieu!
If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
The Carnival at Rome
Parry knew this room, as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle.
“For,” added he, “the future cannot fail to mend; I inevitably look for better times.
The patrol passed.
It is the count’s reply.”
“It is he whom we must warn.
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.
With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over.
“Do not be unhappy, dear friend, on that account; if you have done nothing as yet, you will do something soon,” replied Athos.
“I have not that honor.”
Cromwell’s Letter.
As hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct:
“How?
“The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its setting, and weighed it carefully.
Hold!
Felton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this scene.
Louis XIII.’s confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in reply to the call.
Is anyone ill in the house?” The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets.
In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not.
Bonacieux, against Buckingham, but above all against D’Artagnan—projects lost in the distance of the future.
In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot.
I seemed to be going mad.
“You are right, father; I understand you.” Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols, he said, “There is one for you and one for me—thanks!”
you will get me out if they put me there,” said D’Artagnan.
Let them try to pursue him!
“You asked me for five hundred men, did you not?
One day, in a moment of despair like yours, since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too.
Bonacieux; “therefore, ask my own secrets, and I will reveal them to you; but those of others—that is quite another thing.”
“Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.”
We will see, gentlemen, we will see.
“Oblige me by taking a seat,” said D’Artagnan, pushing a chair toward Mordaunt, who sat down, pale but calm.
“One must,” replied Monsieur de Bouillon, “sacrifice one’s comfort to the public good; but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted.
20207m
The thought was maddening, and Dantès threw himself furiously down on his straw.
I was present during his last moments.
The army, I will answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs.”
“No, indeed,” said D’Artagnan; “I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that remembrance.”
“Fine sport, by Jove!” cried Porthos, with a laugh that shook the windows.
Turning back again, he said, “I thought I saw Winter move; if he still lives, by all you hold most sacred, do not abandon him.”
What was there in it?”
Bazin was then at the height of joy.
The cardinal took the queen’s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips.
“What?”
“And you receive silver from that man?”
He questioned Jacopo.
D’Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.
The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre, which they entered.
There was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall.
Peppino, who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories, struck a light and lit a torch.
In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words D’Artagnan informed him where Mme.
See how deadly pale he is!
“Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I only suspect.”
“Is, then, all that I have heard really true?” she inquired.
“A knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it,” replied Felton.
Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I cannot die without confiding her to someone.”
They halted for the king to dine.
He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France, and begged us—the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallon—to accompany him.
Villefort dropped his head and sighed.
“Oh, Villefort, Villefort,” murmured the count, “this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours!”
“I have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket.”
Then he laid it down, seized his pen, and wrote a few words.
The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker.
Your devotion does not commit you too far, Monsieur de Rochefort.”
“But it was on leaving this club,” said he, “my father disappeared.”
“She _seemed_, did she?”
“No.”
His face was pale and drawn, like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle.
then you are going with me?”
“My very self, dear friend.”
“See,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow.
It is horrible, indeed, but no one assassinates.”
Dantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak.
“Well, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed, that’s all.
Chapter 96.
Andrea felt his heart leap with joy.
This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air _à l’Anglaise_, and the ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral treasures.
“Not at all!
The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy.
“Yes, that’s the thing, my lord!” cried his custodian, gaily.
“But if they fire, all is lost!” cried D’Artagnan.
His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.
As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five-and-forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage.”
Our former life, has it still no attractions for you?
We two are worth a dozen.”
“Silence!” said Mme.
Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read as follows:
He almost believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the crime of De Wardes.
“This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks.
Do as I do.
“Grief has consumed her,” said Villefort—“yes, grief, doctor!
D’Artagnan related his adventure with Mme.
“What proofs do you require?”
“You are determined to leave the chateau?”
This threatening answer, unluckily for the court, produced quite a different effect to that which was intended.
“But if you yourselves should be struck?” said Athos.
I am accustomed to adversity.
This was the departure of Fernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother.
This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find D’Artagnan.
Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required.
my lord!” said the queen, “you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time.
“Of which he is the brightest ornament,” said Beauchamp, drinking off a glass of champagne.
Let us go immediately.”
“No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars.
“How much in that little bag?”
“I was there this very day.”
“No, this is his blood.”
Now, who was that someone?
A man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a tradesman.
La Ramee went out, but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment.
“Let us go,” said she, “I place full confidence in you, my friend!”
It was said that she had poisoned her second husband; she had tried to assassinate her brother-in-law; she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival, and before leaving England she had, it was believed, caused the favorite of the king to be murdered.”
“A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place de Grève.
“You may get into trouble by what has taken place.”
“Read,” said the old man.
Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart’s pulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed.
“Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.”
The builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.
So that in spite of edicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the Musketeers; that is to say, chief of a legion of Cæsars, whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads—he who dreads nothing, as it is said.
“How many are they?”
Mousqueton ran thither, hearing the noise.
“And now,” said Athos, “while they bring the wine, tell me, D’Artagnan, what has become of the others, come!”
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “I am fatigued with reading, and all this Latin confuses me.”
The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay.
“Yes,” said Porthos, “let us take the opposite direction; if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger.
“I don’t say exactly,” answered the Gascon, confused.
“I!
In the meantime D’Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued his route and reached St.
“And who thinks of using him ill?
They were willing and ready to retrace their steps, when, in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town, upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart, Athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk, which represented, with the awkwardness of a first attempt, two cavaliers riding furiously; one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words: “They are following us.”
They have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers, and here they are.
The three companions advanced rather humbly—for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves—leaving Athos the post of speaker.

A CONJUGAL SCENE Chapter XLVI.
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps.
Take it from me when I am—dead.”
“Can you not understand that Monsieur d’Artagnan, being my friend, might take me into his confidence?”
“Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear viscount.”
“That is impossible; but I will tell you a true story, my lord.”
Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two great black feet, which she placed upon her husband’s plate, cut off the neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised the wing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the Musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it.
“The person to whom you were conducted yesterday.”
“Even under this disguise?” asked Mazarin, raising a cloak which covered an arm-chair, upon which lay a complete dress for an officer, of pearl-gray and red, entirely embroidered with silver.
“They lost her?”
“Well, my lord!
“If it brings us back to France——”
“Yes, I heard.”
Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host, who rushed into the apartment crying out, “The Spaniards!
Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about, but he had with him a waxlight, to help him to explore his mysterious strong box.
Madame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.
Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.
Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose of, goes straight to the grocer’s or druggist’s, gives a false name, which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or six grammes of arsenic—if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood.
Chapter LXXXIX.
In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon.
what do you propose?”
There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point.”
Chapter XXVIII.
but it is your own fault.
“You have had too much already, drunkard,” said Danglars; “and if you continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand on your legs.”
to meet D’Artagnan with a false excuse!
“‘Quick!’ said a voice at the end of the gallery.
“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality!
Good, it is by my side!
You are a lieutenant?
let me overtake him!”
“Yes, skirmishers; that is to say, highway robbers.”
“Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it.”
We will talk Italian and Spanish.
Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome Spanish _genet_, she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.
The count withdrew for a moment.
You must take a carriage and an escort, and guard the prisoner with the greatest care.”
“Accept it, my lord, accept it,” said Aramis.
The true nobility laughed at him, the talented repelled him, and the honorable instinctively despised him.
Aramis came behind, giving his arm to Porthos.
“Well?”
“If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands.”
I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very amusing!”
“Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé, “and then observe the lines traced on the wall.

CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY Chapter LIV.
“Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it?”
On the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as D’Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a glass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the road to Paris.
She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain Gaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M. Morrel.
For my part, monsieur, I am Catholic—my father, faithful to his principles, having made my elder brother a Huguenot.”
He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself, devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition; he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission.
The same silence, and then, ere the host could oppose his design, Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt.
“Himself, captain—himself.”
“Do you think, father, that if now I should ask for a company the queen would give it to me?”
why have we not a Grimaud near every prince?”
She blushed, and that she might not answer, clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them.
“Pooh!
At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity of the weather continuing to increase.
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.
“Yes.”
“Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one.”
Albert was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed:
“That horse was to have identified us in the day of battle.
As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.
So you suppose I have need of an escort?
The stranger, then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and seriously placed himself on guard.
The two young persons obeyed.
“Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment; Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources.”
what a gourmand you are growing; I haven’t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years.”
“Go, Comminges, and may God aid you!”
“I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect.
“Why, then, only see!” cried the novice; “we shall soon be well acquainted, almost friends.
“He is an original, then?”
“Grimaud,” said Athos, still on the breach, “another musket!”
“Everything,” said the abbé.
I will do my best.”
that’s a different thing; yes, I know there are traditions of that sort,” said Comminges.
“But since they served your eminence so well, why are they, my lord cardinal, in prison?”
Cornélie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray.
“Be it so!” said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture.
The events which have taken place in my house, though they now occupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or if, indeed, a few enemies should persist in remembering them, why then I will add them to my list of crimes.
“Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world.
But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin, who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.
“Ah, capital,” said Beauchamp.
“When I hear misfortunes named, madame,” he said, “I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own, and then I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind.
I fear that she has badly sprained her ankle.”
“But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned the count.
Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks, fell upon Athos, twined arms of steel around him, and tearing his sword from him, said in his ear:
Supposing, also, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three millions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per cent.”
For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars—excuse my impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the family.”
“What happened to the worthy captain?”
“Of course not!” rejoined Caderousse quickly; “no more do I, and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now.
“We have already asked that question,” said Château-Renaud, “for none of us has seen him.”
You see, Felton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy, no blood will flow.”
By degrees the passage narrowed, yet the duke continued his course.
“Oh!” he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.
“Repeat it!
de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply.
“And that is nothing?”
“No, not that way, I beg, sir,” quickly exclaimed the cardinal, “be so good as to pass by yonder gallery, by which you can regain the hall.
He confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade—the same who was killed—to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the Barrière de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they had missed the carriage by ten minutes.
“Place this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till I send for him.”
Among these two hundred levees, that of Tréville was one of the most sought.
There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression.
But he can easily become one, if he is not already; it is no uncommon thing in Italy.
Is that not true, Monsieur Bonacieux?
The first impulse of these three, and of those who last entered, was to cast an inquiring glance at each other.
To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream.
That’s too many, gentlemen, too many!
“You think then, as I do, that she deceives me?” said the king.
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were defined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.
“And why not?” demanded D’Artagnan.
“Impossible!”
They brought me that book.
On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment.
The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning to the boat, said, “_S’accommodi_.” The Italian _s’accommodi_ is untranslatable; it means at once, “Come, enter, you are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the master.” It is like that Turkish phrase of Molière’s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance.
In fact, they touched the sloop.
“Now, madame,” continued Debray, first opening the closet, then the chest;—“now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each, resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash, making I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker, who, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest assured.”
He ran up the steps, entered the church, and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel, asked him if he knew Monsieur Bazin.
“M.
there is constancy!” Then turning to Grimaud, he said:
“I was going to ask you,” replied the baroness with a beating heart.
As to the astute Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by hitting him in the face, as Cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.
“But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more——”
“I imagined it must be,” said Morrel.
“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she?
It was Rita’s father, who brought his daughter’s ransom in person.
yes, it is so long ago,” answered Porthos.
“Besides, what did I ask of you?” resumed Porthos, with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship.
“You have, perhaps, no money?”
The faint glimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led to the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery.
ah!” exclaimed Rochefort.
The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other, following an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of Corsica.
Impossible, impossible!”
“Dead, dead!” cried Patrick.
There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly.
“Yes; but you stopped at the idea, I hope?”
Beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone.
“Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV.”
“It is indispensable, my lord.”
And he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled down his cheeks.
“La Ramee, I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you, particularly; treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated; that is, never leave him alone an instant.”
“For everything.”
Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid if, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so completely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery.
“Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?”
Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report.
His ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy.
“She was walking with her nurse Marceline, in the place where the woodmen cut the wood, when, passing on horseback, I stopped.
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy.
“That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables; that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor?
A cloud settled on his brow, evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness, instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there.
“Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?”
Beauchamp,” interposed this strange man, “the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself.
“I asked you if you knew him?”
At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door, and told his master that the horses were ready.
Chapter XI.
The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hour’s interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes.
“Monseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.”
I will send you to Constantinople.”
When he reached the door a stream of people, who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out, stood on each side, as he passed, many among them glaring on him with threatening looks.
“Ah,” said Dantès, “you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with toil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”
“Tell me.”
We can wait the more contentedly, that it is not absolutely bad here, but for one thing, at least.”
“Just so,” replied Aramis.
“Yes, and that’s all settled!” exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail.
“And you did not tell him that you came from me?”
“Of course,” naively replied the servant.
13, Paris.”
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “till she comes out.”
Chapter LXXXII.
Bonacieux, with great emotion, “in my name I beg you!
“Ah, Monsieur de Rochefort!
“You understand, then, monsieur,” resumed Planchet, “that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against Monsieur Broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine——”

“Commend me to the cardinal.”
Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned.
However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it earnestly afterward, he was the first to act.
_We hear from Yanina._
“Look, Emmanuel.” Then turning towards Monte Cristo, “Count,” said he, “in the name of all that is dear to you, I entreat you not to kill Albert!—the unhappy youth has a mother.”
La Ramee was going out.
“I am free,” replied Maximilian, “and rich enough to support you.
He was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams—a coffer long and deep, locked, bolted, fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard, and which the hands—a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not without elegance—of the procurator’s wife were about to open to his admiring looks.
“I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion.
“We must understand each other,” said the duke.
Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew to him with open arms.
The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit.
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches, and of her footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved, and then also disappeared.
It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the offence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight, and it was evident Danglars would not fight.
The man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe.
Meanwhile Albert had revived, and, continuing to read, he threw back his head, saying:

He entered by the Faubourg St. Jacques, under verdant arches.
Her pretty face arrested my attention; I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with her.
“May the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur!
“Nothing, my lord, except that he is tormented with remorse.”
“Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of it, I think?”

As he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath.
The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.
“‘Why?’ said Caderousse with a shudder; ‘why, that he might not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.’
“Oh, nothing but a scratch,” said D’Artagnan.
“Well, but can’t you speak?”
“My worthy Cocles,” said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, “do you remain in the antechamber.
It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance, but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time.”
“From Madame de Montbazon?” he cried.

Let us return to M. Franz d’Épinay.
“That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M. Bertuccio.
We went to take Monsieur Athos to the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain.”
“When I like.”
The king looked towards him.

“Ah!
“But is she safe?” asked the father.
At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature, his form, nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against the red tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel.
“This knife was my only hope.
“Folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at.
Ah, here is one of them, I believe.”
“Are you sure of it?” asked Albert.
They walked from one end of the chateau to the other, Porthos looking with wondering eyes at D’Artagnan, who was counting on his fingers.
So, my dear Aramis, say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny.”
“It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you; but remember that you are not to strike till I give the signal.”

An instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and spurred.
“Impossible!” cried Milady, “you are such a valiant man, and such an expert swordsman.”
M. Morrel, allow me to present to you M. Franz d’Épinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom I made the tour of Italy.
“Why is she not come?” asked the prince in a low voice, addressing his brother.
“It is, my dear Valentine,” said the baroness, “that you are, doubtless, suffering.”
Yesterday, for two hours, I was at the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and for two hours I prayed most fervently.
Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and covered it with kisses that Mercédès did not even feel.
“Come, come, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, “do not affect to be strong-minded; there are tears in your eyes.
“What have you to say in your defense?” asked Bradshaw of the king.
But D’Artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man, complete, except for the sword, arranged along the wall.

At the queen’s last word, D’Artagnan had dragged Porthos into the gallery.
“See that, now!” said Porthos; “and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him!
Villefort hung his head, d’Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said “Yes” with his eyes.
Nearly four years had passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time.

Then, rushing hastily out of the apartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study, but he rapped there in vain.
D’Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest’s could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis had procured him.
The valet went out of the room, this time by the centre door, but still as silently as before; one might have fancied him an apparition.
“But in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty.”
“I was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs—an officer, brave and handsome as a youthful Caesar;” then, pretending to see Raoul for the first time:
“Oh, sir,” exclaimed M. de Boville, “your fears are unfortunately but too well founded, and you see before you a man in despair.
Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes.
“Thank you, and God reward you!
“Intact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and mine.”
Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise, was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks, believing too, that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth, namely, patience and Christian charity.
Soon, as the road turned, the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view; then, a quarter of a mile beyond, a white house, encircled in sycamores, was visible at the farther end of a group of trees, which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers.
But all the time he was in Paris, you, of course, did not lose sight of him?”

An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf.
“I will not,” continued he, after a moment’s silence, “conceal from you, that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities.”
Villefort sprang into the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his arms.

Escape had never once occurred to him.
I am a brute.
“To me, to a brother?” said Felton.
“Yes, my lord.”
At this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other, the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed.
“What do you want, Henrietta?” she demanded.
Close to the hedge the steps stopped.
“Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.”
“This is not to the purpose,” said Eugénie; “let us speak candidly, sir; I admire candor.”
Keep watch from seven to nine.
The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping.
Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel, devoted friends in business, merry companions in our ancient pleasures.”
“No,” said Danglars, “no, decidedly no; keep my signatures.
“Ah?—what next?”
“And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers.”
“What is that?” said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not over.
These words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused.
Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy; every one turned around and beheld Athos, livid, his eyes dim and his hands trembling, supporting himself on the edge of the boat.
“Do you wish for time to pay?”
“What, mother?”
de Chevreuse and consequently the queen.
Chapter III.
“Father,” he exclaimed, turning pale as death, “what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat?”
“Do not say that, Debray,” returned Beauchamp, laughing, “for here is Château-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.”
“No, my friend,” replied Athos, in his gentle but decided voice, “we came here to defend King Charles; we have but ill defended him—it remains for us to save him!”
Why, every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that—for a bullet may break a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head.
“Ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance!
“Horse!” said Aramis, with a grimace of disgust.
To you, perhaps, they will accord the time they have refused to me.
“It contained my fortune!”
“Help, help!”
“Oh, this is very interesting,” said Debray; “if there really has been a crime, we will investigate it.”
“On the contrary,” said D’Artagnan, “we shall hear better.”
Now, I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but——”
Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed upon the count.
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten o’clock; if he did not return by ten o’clock she was to sail.
“And the prince was pleased with you?”
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I perfectly recollect him; I think he was your colleague.”
Mazarin wished to approach her.
“That house is suspected, Tréville,” said the king; “perhaps you did not know it?”
“And why day after to-morrow?” asked Madame de Chevreuse.
“In fact, I have rarely seen such excess of impudence.”
At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all probability, the opening must be.
I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.”
“Alack!
The arrest produced no sensation, indeed was almost unknown, and scarcely interrupted the course of events.
The door opened and Bazin entered; on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair.
“What would you?
“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had raised.
“Ah!
“Do you fear he will not understand?”
Have you not heard that some one is coming here?”
“Still?” cried Villefort; “oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.”
“And why?”
It was just five o’clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear.
All at once there’s a noise like a cannon—that’s the air blowing up the deck.
“You see I am generous, am I not, mother?”
“I dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had left—my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster.
Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained.
I have fought too long; they have sold me, they shall give me up, and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads.”
“Colonel, colonel,” cried Mordaunt, “you are betrayed.
“I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say, ‘Gentlemen, your servant, Mousqueton, is thirsty.’ What does Monsieur Bracieux care, think you, whether I am thirsty or not?”
“Yes, monseigneur.
“One of them was a foreigner, English, I think.
“Ah, to be sure.”
“Does your excellency happen to be hungry?”
Mazarin, after this half humble, half gallant attention, went away.
“If it be not an indelicate question,” resumed D’Artagnan, “have you grown rich?”
“What dost thou there, rascal?” asked Comminges.
D’Artagnan was known to this valet-de-chambre, who was no other than Bernouin, and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the cardinal.
“Toward Paris, sir?”
“Monsieur de Beaufort?
Chapter XXXI.
But how to die?
So saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her fears and agitations were genuine.
The man made no reply.
“A mortal enemy.”
“I wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out.
“Let her humble herself, then, and come to me first.”
Comminges, so to speak, threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him.
“Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby.
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?”
“Well, upon my honor,” said Athos, “your Eminence is right in taking us with you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces.”
I am not unhappy while I possess my son!”
The Dappled Grays
“Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth.
“What ails our friend?” said Aramis, “he resembles one of Dante’s damned, whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels.
Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room.
“Indeed!” thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry clerks—for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table, “in my cousin’s place, I would not keep such gourmands!
“But as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief, he should have been—”
I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have sacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it.
Oh, Mercédès, I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow, with the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen with cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it, consumed with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison.
Athos, on horseback, without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges, followed the cardinal in silence.
Athos took his son’s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee.
“But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent.”
“On my word,” said Franz, “you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as Ulysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.”
D’Artagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet.
“Exactly so,” said the host; “I remember it perfectly.
“Andrea, he has some secretaire with a spring.”
What I know is, that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Cæsar’s _Commentaries_, and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me, that unless the next morning, before six o’clock, four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker’s, at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist.
Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws, without revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all—in thirteen throws.
At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number “1.” D’Artagnan knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he entered the chamber.
The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.”
“Since,” said D’Artagnan, “they have friends who ask it for them.”
“Ah, you have a noble heart,” said the count; “so much the better.”
But let us be quick—the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the Fort l’Evêque or the Bastille who has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.”
He rapidly devoured his food, and after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a lever.
I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you.
The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island.
Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison, Monsieur du Vallon and myself, because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I., brother-in-law of the late king, your husband, the consort of Madame Henrietta, your sister and your guest, and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr.
The baron, finding himself disarmed, took two or three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward.
“What matters it, if you avoid them?”
He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March, that is, ten or twelve days after Napoleon’s return.
“Well, do you not adopt this means, Athos?” said D’Artagnan.
The cardinal smiled.
“What!
Villefort shrugged his shoulders.
Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.”
“I salute you, “MARIE MICHON”
That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées, the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner.
“I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by the day after tomorrow.”
Debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself, he bowed with an air which seemed to say, “As you please, madame.”
Mousqueton inquired, therefore, the state of the case of his old friend, who confirmed the statement of D’Artagnan.
It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer, had come in person to see him.
For instance, there is apoplexy—that lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which brings everything to an end.
He opened a window and leaned out to listen.
“True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”
The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low voice: “It was scarcely nine o’clock when I heard a noise in the street, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, I found that somebody was endeavoring to open it.
He will explain to you the steps that I expect you to pursue.
“To M. Franz d’Épinay.
“And I also,” said Porthos.
And then he—a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man without family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and restaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats—was about to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little attentions which “the harder one is, the more they please,” as old soldiers say.
M. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had predicted.
“But why, mother?”
Anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her.
They won’t devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!”
“I—I was where D’Artagnan stands.
“Approach, M. de Villefort,” resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom.
“By no means,” replied the count in the most frigid tones; “Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities.
Well, sit down, and let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which I have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one.
M. de Morcerf will accompany me.”
The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves.
Then he rang.
The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road, but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside.
Chapter 17.
“From her Majesty!” said Buckingham, becoming so pale that D’Artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal.
The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family.
What am I?
At this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.
“Pardon me,” he added with a smile, “I leave you, Albert.” Albert understood his thoughts.
Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him to the count.
Our family, although still rich (for my father’s income amounts to half a million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I myself was, at the age of five years, taken away by the treachery of my tutor, so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence.
“And me, too, monsieur,” said Blaisois.
Charles Stuart, you are our prisoner.”

The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step; their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces.
How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin?
“Pardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,” said he; “but, not knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a friend.

The silence became almost painful when, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie:
“But,” said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, “we are friends, are we not?”
There, however, ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank.
“What more will you say?”
“Was I not a good ambassador in France?”
‘_This is the head of Ali Tepelini, Pasha of Yanina._’
3, 1627
“That, then, is your opinion?” asked Aramis.
“We will be with you at that time,” said the major.
“Give it to me, then.” And Monte Cristo took the letter, which he opened and read.
Ever since Valentine’s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent and sad.
“So I presume,” said Athos, “that you have a large number of the nobles with you?”
“Do gentlemen, then, make verses?” asked Raoul, naively, “I thought it was derogatory.”
“Viscount, your countenance, your goodness and your courage incline me toward you; my gratitude is already due.
A young man—we can sketch his portrait at a dash.
“My good friend,” said Valentine, “I should take you for a visionary, and should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this.
Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that his billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.
“But where are you really going?”
But this year,” continued the horticulturist, “I’ll take care it shall not happen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe.”
Do you fancy because you have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us?
“I am patient, but go on.”
“Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the martingale of man.
“The one with a white dress and so many diamonds—the fair one.”
“M.
I shall call you presently.”
Pressing his lips close to the planks, he exclaimed:
Determined to put the advice of M. de Tréville in practice instantly, D’Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order to superintend the packing of his valise.
He was then reconducted by the little staircase, instead of passing through the ante-chamber where D’Artagnan was waiting.
“A telegraph?” repeated Madame de Villefort.
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estrée, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal’s quarters were upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house without any entrenchment.
“’Tis true.
“They thought this order did not concern me, sir; nevertheless, if you wish it, I am ready to go.”
“You are mistaken, friend D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, always on his guard; “this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.”
“Because these horses are not to be sold,” was the reply.
When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination.
“My father,” said the young man, bending his knee, “bless me!” Morrel took the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and kissing his forehead several times said:
Has he taken off his doublet?”
“That is well; wait patiently, then.”
Caderousse drew a deep breath.
30119m
“But what?” asked the groom.
It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance.”
Now, here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that he did not.
“By the scorn I will throw upon her.”
“Have me arrested on the part of the queen,” said he, “and I—I will appeal to his Eminence.”
At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty, and hastening his steps, as if to reach the other side of the port, scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking.
“Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,” said Madame de Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door, led by his mother.
And he is in Paris?” continued he, addressing Raoul; then turning to the queen: “We may still hope.
Are we not their Majesties’ servants?”
“As I was anxious to repair the wrongs I had done the prisoner,” resumed the innkeeper, “I took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty.
“Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?”
“Eh, eh!” said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period, “there is one who will be equipped in good time!”
We say the gravel he trod under his feet, for D’Artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of Angoutin.
The Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice.
I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.
She had laid that down the preceding evening.
“Doubtless,” replied the count, “since no one hears me complain.”
“You command us, my lord, to do so?”
“Well, where the devil are you going now?” cried Athos.
As Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him.
and their captain—see!
“Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from ambition,—Fernand and Danglars.”
and what is it to be?
“You should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are; but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.”
See, it is on fire yet with his hot blood, for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound.”
“There it is, then,” said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the carriage.
Thank you, viscount,” continued the prince, laughing, “and I appoint you from this moment my interpreter.”
The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.
“Then it was so,” murmured Winter, “and the next day Henry IV.

“To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars’.”
Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father, now a madman, and her brother who died last September with his mother.
“And I,” said Porthos, rolling his large eyes, “remember, I will skin you alive.”
Do you want money?
Felton reappeared, and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in ready spread.
Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so.
They led me away masked.
“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Danglars; then, approaching Monte Cristo, he added, “especially before young M. Cavalcanti;” after which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question.
He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball-room, that Valentine ran to him, saying:
But Monsieur de Tréville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first sight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the Musketeers.”
And yet we must be drawing near the disclosure.”
“Afraid of being heard?
“With regard to myself, Monsieur de Rochefort,” replied Mazarin, “I am not, like Monsieur de Richelieu, all-powerful.
The four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it.
Athos smiled.
“It is this, madame: that you should appear to have reflected, and publicly acknowledge an error, which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government; release Broussel from prison and give him back to the people.”
The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the moment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a map the route from St. Petersburg to China.
Andrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm.
“I am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.
“Immediately,” replied D’Artagnan; “we have not a minute to lose.”
Tomorrow, then!” he added, turning towards Bertuccio.
“Ah, he’s gone to Blois; the poor boy——”
It seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto.
The door being closed, the four friends waited in expectation.
When he reappeared, Athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on D’Artagnan, but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face.
“His honor’s equipage is waiting,” said Mousqueton.
The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head.
“And did you also discover a bitter taste?”
Come, come, madame!” cried D’Artagnan, seizing her hands, and surveying her with an ardent glance, “come, be more generous.
“Good,” replied Athos, whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty; “tell the captain we are coming.”
It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of the lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong.
“Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.”
They both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.
“‘But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent my recommendation.’
In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in France, and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche’s anti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman’s drops are among my favorite remedies.
“So far, then,” said Danglars, mentally, “all has gone as I would have it.
The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that Cæsar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals.
When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume.
They ordered the driver to take them to No.
“Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue de l’Echelle, and ask for Germain.”
What you would now do amounts to treason.”
This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.
“By General Oliver Cromwell.
“Am I, then, to remain here eternally?” demanded Milady, with a certain terror.
Morrel was, in fact, very happy.
She had turned from the window, which remained open, and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid, incoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance.
“Come this way.” Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the letter we have seen, and gave it to the steward.
“What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed.
In fact, the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was, rubbing their hands, for it was cold, it being the month of February.
“Have you finished?” said Andrea,—“do you want anything more?—will you have my waistcoat or my hat?
They re-entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles; and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois, they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud.
“As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.”
“Go ahead, my friend,” said Athos; “I am sure that whatever you do is well done.”
my friend,” said he, “one never has too much money.
“Why, then, do you always weep, mother, when I am away from you?” she said.
Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain.”
And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went.
But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover.
“‘The road takes a turn—he is obliged to follow it—while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road.’
“My lord,” replied Athos, “for myself I have nothing to demand.
“And yet you will let me perish with hunger?”
“It is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty.”
“Come,” said he to himself, “be a man.
“Oh, be easy!
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert.
Rely on me.”
“At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself dreaming.
Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,” continued the Jesuit; “_porrige digitos_—present the fingers.
And that is a mousetrap.
On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder, which caused a vibration in the bed.
“In the first place, then, who examined you,—the king’s attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?”
And then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all our property returns to Valentine.”
Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew.
Grimaud was so breathless, so exhausted, that he had fallen back upon a chair.
It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening.
But in vain did he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship.
“To wait for me.
“Nor I, nor I,” chorused the sailors.
My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk.
“Two millions?—three?—four?
M——.”
“I think I have killed the insolent fellow.
“Are you satisfied, gentlemen?” asked Mazarin.
Why should I?”
Well, that was a temptation for two wretches like you.
“This confession,” said she, growing paler, “what is this confession?”
“You have hurt yourself, perhaps,” said Morrel.
“Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?”
The woman, especially, was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals.
Danglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting-house.
Grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were, then shut it and double-locked it, and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure.
“Grimaud,” said Athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion, “take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall, put their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands.”
He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near to him as you can, and cut off two.
He recalled, all at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady, her first attempts after her arrival.
Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina?
They ask where I was born; I answer.
“Well, one can never say what may happen; at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends.”
The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to utter a word.
Mercédès smiled sadly.
“So much so,” replied Monte Cristo, “that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.”
Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day.
“We are betrayed,” said the king in a low voice.
Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room; and after asking Bernouin, who stood at the door, whether anything had occurred during his absence, and being answered in the negative, he desired that he might be left alone.
Title: The Three Musketeers
“I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that.”
“This gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious danger,” continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to D’Artagnan with his hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.
Neither dared for some time to speak in that room.
The count, in his survey of the pit, encountered a pale face and threatening eyes, which evidently sought to gain his attention.
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character—perfecting a beautiful vengeance.
if I may ask without indiscretion.”
If it were bad money, there might be some hopes; but unfortunately, those were all good pieces.”
Where is he?”

“Ah, monsieur!” cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master, “here is more trouble.
“What to do?”
“Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?”
Meantime, Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke.
Millionaires like yourself, my lord, are rare in France.”
What was most clear in the matter was that D’Artagnan loved Milady like a madman, and that she did not love him at all.

“But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them.”
I never heard you mentioned, and I did not dare inquire for you.
I shall kill him—I cannot help it.
But, hush, here comes somebody.”
“Whenever my lord pleases.”
“Good!” thought D’Artagnan; “I fancied it was so.”
“No; but my mother, as a child, saw her.
My father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses considerable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my life is dear, at your disposal.”
Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps, then fell at the feet of Noirtier, and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed:

What a strange fellow you are,’ said the jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand.

When I saw her weeping I began to cry too.
“So be it!” said D’Artagnan, “but I—I confess I have a contrary conviction.”
He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o’clock; fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side in the Corso, and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is hardly ten minutes’ walk from the Hôtel de Londres.

“A moment,” cried D’Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half-drawn swords.
“A very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.”
“What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?” said Porthos.
“I must beg your Eminence to observe,” said Milady, “that since the affair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me, his Grace distrusts me.”
The young woman complied.
The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the corridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.

The cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it, whilst D’Artagnan stood imperturbable, without showing either impatience or curiosity.
“Hush!” said Athos, speaking in a low voice.
At first they saw nothing around them.

“Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?”
Aramis shook his head.

Arrived at Ryston, D’Artagnan assembled his friends.
In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur d’Herblay our crime would be confirmed.
Scarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck, and which never left him.
He was occupied with the preparations for Raoul’s departure and was seeking to gain time.
(“She is going to have him killed,” said D’Artagnan to Porthos, “but at all events it shall not be by me.
Then he added, in a low tone, “Yes; that is the haven.”
D’Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman, pointing his sword to his throat, “I could kill you, my Lord, you are completely in my hands; but I spare your life for the sake of your sister.”
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which D’Artagnan had generously relinquished.
“Well, what does that prove?” asked Valentine.
“With Spain, no,” answered D’Artagnan; “but Paris.”
He had nothing more to do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one.
“I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.”
This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting.
Our holy father, the pope, has made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the Christians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from Eastern monarchs of his services.”
“True, my lord!” exclaimed La Ramee.
“He is writing,” she said.
“I should say you could!
“Fine-looking men, upon my word!” said D’Artagnan.
“D’Art——” exclaimed Athos, whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his hand.
“Yes, the king; but to-day you have not fought for the king, you have fought for Mazarin; which is not quite the same thing.”
“Why do you remember when it forgets?
Are you there, now?”
D’Artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed, saying, “Let us go.”
“Well, in the meantime?”
“What of that?
What we are going to say does not concern your majesty.”
“Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.”
“Have you not mentioned that name to me?”
But, after all, he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him.”
The Puritan then went out.
No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do not fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise it so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me.
“Eight!” said Aramis; “it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and D’Artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men.”
But I know you to be a man of honor.”
“Come, monsieur.”
Besides, the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in Paris but very few days.
_Imponite manus_, and not _manum_—place the _hands_, not the _hand_.”
“No.”
“Let me think a moment.
“The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?”
He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him.
“Possibly, madame.
It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated together.
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan to himself.
Not Monsieur d’Artagnan?” exclaimed the commissary.
“What do you wish to see first?” asked the abbé.
At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale.
“Oh, is this true what you say?”
“Ah, true,” said Monte Cristo “there is a postscript.”
“Almost.”
Bonacieux; “somebody is coming.”
This is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended.
At what hour does the examination take place?”
No sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it, and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor, in his turn, was snoring immoderately.
you have seen your dream realized.”
“Sir,” replied Bazin, “I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause.”
I may sleep, perhaps, at an inn.”
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details.
D’Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment two shots were fired.
When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face.
“That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family——”
Then, turning toward Raoul: “Go, monsieur,” he said; “ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Grammont.”
“Quite the contrary, Planchet; the more ill will I have toward Monsieur Bonacieux, the more punctual I shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy.”
Oh, quite the contrary, dear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to declare I am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.”
Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?”
“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe.
A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage, and which, while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust, pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins, incited him to join in the general combat, in which all the masks around him were engaged.
“Sir,” said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion,—“sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes here.
It was Morrel’s turn to become pale.
“Calm yourself.
The prisoner glanced at the windows—they were grated; he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither.
When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him.
The musketeers, who had already discovered who Mazarin was, followed in profound silence.
The child was born, was given to me—motionless, breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.”
You will be a brave and adventurous captain.”
Speak.”
The two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his Eminence.
As he approached it, Noirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.
“That poor Count de Rochefort.”
“On the watch——”
Different in your fate from us, you will have a king without a minister, whom you may serve, love, respect.
“These are, doubtless, your family arms?
Morrel raised his head, and reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural lustre,—
Stay where you are; I will go myself.”
Dancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy—everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in.
The monks had no longer an instant of repose.
“We know that,” said Beauchamp.
“But this letter in which he recommends you to me?”
He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères, Luchon, and Cauterets.
Tell him all about it, baron.”
The two grooms held the horses, that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled, and Grimaud was posted as sentinel.
Conspiracy
Without further explanation D’Artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat, placed them in his belt, wrapped himself in his cloak, and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left, he took his way toward the Richelieu gate.
He was eighteen, only three years older than you are, Raoul, when I saw him set to work, pitted against tried men.”
“You have no reason to envy him on that score, for I owe to you the pleasure of knowing him,” replied the witty woman, with a smile which recalled Marie Michon to Aramis and to Athos.
“He furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that honor.”
“Come with me, then.
So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé, who really was gentleness itself.”
“One of your friends!”
Wait!”
“The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how long they did so, nobody knows.
“Faith, yes, with a haughty presence, a fine equipage; such as the son of a noble house would have.”
“Upon my word,” said Albert, “I deserve no credit for what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself.
Since I became an abbé I dream of nothing but battles.”
MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY Chapter LVIII.
On the evening of the ball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in her hair, and gayest glass beads,—she was in the costume of the women of Frascati.
“At half-past ten.”
In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his affairs.
“You will send him to me.”
And approaching the carriage, he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box.
They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut, four fine horses.
“Nothing.”
“Do you, then, also join in betraying me, Monsieur Cardinal, by thus always opposing my will?
Athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately.
Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say, “Here I am, Maximilian; come and help me.” He had arranged everything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field; a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps, as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions.
30093m
“Come in,” said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant, whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed.
“And your slave?”
Bernouin re-entered the cabinet, returning in a few seconds.
“Everywhere.”
“Still, sir; and I shall always do so,” replied d’Avrigny, “for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind; and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen well to what I am going to say, M. de Villefort.”
Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls himself a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction.”
“It matters not; you were wrong to reply to him as you did,” continued Aramis, following with his eyes the young man, now vanishing behind the cliffs.
“Why, did you not hear all we said?” inquired Caderousse.
“Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments, and which have no heraldic meaning whatever.
“How kind you are.”
D’Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.
“No—yes, he was.
Besides, my friend D’Artagnan has something to say to me privately, have you not, D’Artagnan?”
Come, come, calm yourself, Madame Puritan, or I’ll remove you to a dungeon.
0295m
“Oh,” said Monte Cristo “it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me, for I already know it.”
“Ten thousand devils!” cried Groslow, rushing to the hatchway; “perhaps there is still time to save us.”
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment.
Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”
“What says the abbé?” asked Athos, quietly.
And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing.
“You see, then,” said Athos, “there is a god in heaven still!”
The king’s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal, are they?” continued M. de Tréville, as furious at heart as his soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors.
You may torture, torment, kill me, but you shall not have my signature again!”
It was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain—not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady.
“Yes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels, in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them.”
hi!
The wounded man smiled sadly.
“Oh, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell.
“My God!
You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.”
My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not bear to see her suffer.
“What!
“The devil!” thought Porthos, “this is poor work.
“Then, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the cardinal.”
The coadjutor looked at the queen, who replied by a sign in the affirmative.
“When we have a fog.”
I am getting more and more seasick.”
No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.” Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.
“25th April, 1498.
Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning with the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about to fail her.
“Well, yes, madame,” said the novice, “Are we rivals?”
“I would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser,” said Monte Cristo, “did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends, and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore, in departing from this rule, I should (as the actors say) be playing a part quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run the risk of being hissed, which would be an act of folly.”
He was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his hand.
Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his shoulder to the count, who, this time, leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage.
“There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here, and the grass is soft.”
“Most likely,” replied Vampa coolly.
“Assuredly,” said d’Avrigny.
Grimaud seemed to him an Antinous.
But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties, but the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the surgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son-in-law.
How ghastly pale he is!”
On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks,—the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter.
that’s unworthy.
“And you were right,” cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.
it would be but an unsafe retreat.
The marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still lived for her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and bursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an armchair, where she buried her venerable head.
“Yes, you were thinking of it, and with justice.
“How do you do, my dear son?” said the major gravely.
my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “if these are the prunes that are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them.”
“Lord!” ejaculated the young princess, falling on her knees, “have mercy on us!”
“Speak lower!” said Athos.
“Andrea, Andrea,” repeated several young people, who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.
In the midst of the disasters that befell the house, Cocles was the only one unmoved.
“Yes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw him into some snare.”
Our duty is fulfilled.”
The devil!” said Porthos.
“No one has _brought_ a letter, monsieur,” replied Planchet; “but one has come of itself.”
“Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn to ask you some questions.”
“I?
Ja!” in the most German and the least Gascon accent possible.
“So long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly, sheltered as I was by justice and law; but since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of God’s creatures—since that day——”
“But how shall I address the minister?”
“And will he aid this project?”
In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII., like all other things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed.
D’Artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal he would give Comminges time to arrive before him, and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he, D’Artagnan, and his friend had rendered to the queen’s party in the morning.
“Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage.”
“Well?”
0351m
You were too young to know about such things.”
D’Artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying.
“At ten o’clock then, if you please; I should like it early, as I am going into the country tomorrow.”
All I can say is, if ever I should get such a chance, the living should be my theme.”
“Do you believe it?”
Will our help come from you?”
“The history to which M. Morrel alludes,” continued Château-Renaud, “is an admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our stomachs, and not our memories.
Laporte pointed to the child, who was asleep.
“That does not prevent,” replied Milady, softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression, “my being alone or being persecuted.”
“In ugliness, in so far as a man can resemble a woman.”
“And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon, are we not to enjoy his society?”
D’Artagnan, when he gave way to his own feelings—which were in accordance with those of the queen—had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted.
So that, thanks to her friend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near Rome.
“Yes, I know what brand you are talking about.”
But never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will have no bad effects.”
D’Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed.
Everything was conducted in the usual manner.
At four o’clock, as we have already stated, the mysterious personage arrived.
“Oh!
“Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.”
It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the _Pharaon_,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”
“_Morbleu_, monsieur!” said he, “however far I may come, it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you.”
Aramis mumbled verses to himself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache, in sign of despair.
But Queen Henrietta, without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions, crossed the cabinet, opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal’s numerous guards, courtiers eager to pay homage, the luxurious show of a competing royalty, she went and took the hand of De Winter, who stood apart in isolation.
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseau,—you remember,—the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger.
“Yes.”
“No.”
At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which, instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou, drove up to the green door.
“Enter.
“Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will receive the same sum.”
“At any rate,” said Albert, “whatever disease or doctor may have killed her, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,—or, still rather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.”
“Get down then and quickly.”
“From him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.”
His fears were now no longer for his hoard, but for himself.
“You decide, then, nothing about me, my lord?”
“Speak, speak!” said Valentine; “I entreat you.”
“What did he say?”
No signature.
“Listen to Monsieur de Tréville,” said the king; “listen to him!
Fortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember—fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him.
“Pardon, pardon, my officer, and I will tell you all.”
The evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by D’Artagnan at last arrived.
Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend.
“_Pardieu!_ and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted.
Go.”
“Don’t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess.”
“Nothing would be more easy,” said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail, “but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal.”
The two men were left alone.
But all this will come to an end, Tréville, will come to an end.
They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and with a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to another subject.
“We will see about that presently,” said D’Artagnan, with a slight smile.
The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the addition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert.
Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which, unwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to time.
Section 4.
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival.
“Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?”
He promised to be here, and I have very great faith in Planchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad.”
The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war.
“Ah, sir,” he exclaimed, “it was you!
“Then you speak German, also?” asked the prince.
“I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,” said Morrel; “we were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of your grief, when a carriage rolled into the courtyard.
You will get yourself exiled, as you did in the time of Louis XIII.
It was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve.”
“And you say he is dressed as a monk, Grimaud?”
“Hear me, count,” replied D’Artagnan; “instead of making compliments to each other, let us explain our conduct to each other, like men of right and honest hearts.”
“Nothing, my lord; Monsieur d’Artagnan belongs to the service; Monsieur d’Artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal, who pays him, as much as we make it ours, we citizens, to attack him, whom he robs.”
“Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?”
“Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars restrained me.
“And what is it to you?” replied the king; “we are not of the same religion.”
“May I ask what that was?” said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance.
“Zounds!
“In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?” interrupted Buckingham.
The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question.
Athos was introduced and announced by name.
“To Malta?”
As for the remission of your sins, we have the archbishop of Paris, who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome, and even the coadjutor, who possesses some plenary indulgences; we will recommend you to him.”
“Your son shall be happy, Mercédès,” repeated the count.
“Yes, but before we can kill him—and he will be hard to kill, that Swiss—he will shriek out and the whole picket will come, and we shall be taken like foxes, we, who are lions, and thrown into some dungeon, where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of Rueil, which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the moon is like the sun.
Beauchamp turned to look at some paintings.
“No!”
Possessed by this idea, the cardinal resolved to know all about D’Artagnan immediately; of course he could not inquire from D’Artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career; he remarked, however, in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a Gascon accent.
The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by order of the cardinal.
Listen to me.
“You heard—Cavalcanti.”
That gentleman, your friend, defended himself desperately.
“I am lost,” said he.
“Really, sir, you are delightful, and I should like to spend a month at Bragelonne.”
Take care of yourself, and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of.
“Nothing else than I say—search.”
“Oh, you despise them.”
She had heard something said about supper.
If there was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it, concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with a bird-of-paradise.
Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise of breaking furniture.
You are a generous man, Albert, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment; if you refuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you, I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair.”
“Yes, we know that.”
Monte Cristo returned her smile.
Friquet counterfeited surprise, and twisting his new cap around in his fingers, said:
They will not dare to refuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and will be happy for an instant.
“But what must be done?” said Andrea, disappointed.
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
Raoul has no fortune other than I possess, poor child!
“No,” said Monte Cristo; “I told you I did not wish to be behind my time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount’s door.” The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false—besides, why should he tell a falsehood?
Raoul!” he ejaculated.
The duke smiled.
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be branded.
“What?”
“Ay, ay!” said Porthos; “pass the pen to Aramis, who writes theses in Latin.”
“Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.”
I will go down.”
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then slowly raised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her window, and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she reflected.
At Eccuis, the same scene was repeated.
“And you, sir?” he said.
And Villefort, with his papers under his arm and hat in hand, directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife.
we are lost!”
“And the headsman of Bethune gave me a reply.”
You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep for me?”
The wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.
Noirtier fixed his eyes on her.
It may still be possible to overtake the prisoner.
“What is that?” asked the young man.
“I love you; you permit me to tell you that I do—that is already more happiness than I dared to hope.”
“Nothing,” replied the count; “only, as you see, the Carnival has commenced.
“Capitally,” replied M. de Busigny.
“He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection,” said Madame de Villefort.
He would, no doubt, have believed that he had returned to the times of Florian, and would have declared, on reaching Paris, that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill.
Morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then all his strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Cristo.
The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation.
“Yes—that is, I had it,” repined the Gascon, making believe to find it.
“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for recreation or support.”
The president looked at his auditors.
“Do you remember your father, Haydée?”
When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly, but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master, and everything went ill.
You know something about him, do you not, madame?
All these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes.”
“You, Aramis, know Anne of Austria better than I do.
The Three Musketeers
“And in that case, how shall I know where you are?”
His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence.
What matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.”
“Nothing,” replied Maximilian.
“Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine’s room.”
She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents.
“No.”
“We must inform the queen.”
Oh, yes, especially beautiful.
As a further precaution they had bound his hands.
“Yes; but without fail.”
if we had been five!” murmured Athos, thinking of D’Artagnan and Porthos.
“He is dead, my lord!” said Aramis.
“Have you seen D’Artagnan?”
A benefit reproached is an offense committed.”
“At midnight.”
“Very well, very well,” said the workman aloud, in excellent English.
“Read it.”
Yes, yes; but now what did I do with that letter?”
Gentlemen, your hands; are we not pretty good Christians?”
At that moment I encountered the eye of the prince.
The queen, smiling, made a sign with her head; the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the threshold.
He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort.
My mother-in-law expended gold, caresses, dignities on Concini, who ruined her; the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination: while I have left in obscurity, in poverty, the noble D’Artagnan, who saved me!”
His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life.

“The proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”
It was the portrait of a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, with a dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes, veiled beneath long lashes.
As for his wife, he bowed to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life.
“For my master?” replied Planchet, astonished.
Milady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the end; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step, and seemed to listen.
“I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of such dreams.
Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master, I have been constantly seeking him, but all in vain.
Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting?”
“Well, count,” replied Morrel gayly, “I will not dispute it.”
Andrea ran to the other door, leading to the gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood with his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in his clenched hand.
D’Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to Athos’s, and according to custom, related everything to him.
This space passed, Mme.
“‘We have.’
Villefort seized the doctor’s hand.
Did you not observe his despair on the journey?
“Who is this Groslow?” asked Porthos.

“But,” cried the bandit, “that is only another way of killing me.
“Yes, they are wrong,” said D’Artagnan.
Porthos lent him his back and D’Artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall, where he seated himself.
“When shall we land in England?” he asked; but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply.
“But I shall not be allowed to go; I am almost a prisoner.”
“You think, then, I have something to dread?” asked D’Artagnan.
“That’s Porthos all over,” murmured D’Artagnan.
“Listen; this is his description: ‘Benedetto, condemned, at the age of sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ He promised well, as you see—first a runaway, then an assassin.”
“What is the matter?” asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.
“Ah, excellency, you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves!”
The only thing that astonished D’Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this.
“What?” said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion, “have you another invalid?”
I have pledged my last jewels, sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants, who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice.
Speak, Comte de la Fere!”
Athos turned pale.
They entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table.

I will swear to you by my soul’s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment!”
You are young and rich—leave Paris—all is soon forgotten in this great Babylon of excitement and changing tastes.
“The other one, the gardener’s.

“How!” cried D’Artagnan; “you don’t know where Aramis is?”
As all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, D’Artagnan began to recover himself little by little.
There was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper.
“Peste!
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for reflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage, and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind.
The sound was heard by the people about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door.
But this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse, and advanced to meet D’Artagnan.
Furnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes.

“True enough; he wanted to kill me!” returned the turnkey.
She has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity.

Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron.

She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them.”
The nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house.
“You would be all the wiser,” said Athos.
Maximilian understood him.
His host here was a good fellow from Picardy, who gave him all the information he needed.
“I was going out, sir.”
“Who goes there?

Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance, saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it.
“Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,” said Madame de Villefort, “since you had cured the sick.”
It was true, and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning; he gave his horse its head, struck his spurs into its sides, and the animal, urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him, bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place, and fell into the river, scattering to a distance waves of white froth.

Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort; he called out to him, but they were too distant to be heard; then, in spite of the weariness of his beast, he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers, and when he had again attained a new height, the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank.

“You met him, I dare say, in the park—hunting, perhaps?”
“Yes.”

Morrel, a sailor is attached to his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to say, ‘Get along—save yourselves.’ We soon launched the boat, and all eight of us got into it.
“I cannot tell you, monsieur.”

“M.
You believe, and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies, of the enemy of England, of the enemy of God!
On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital.
The baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary.
“You will find me ready to follow you.”
And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it.
not the first prince of the blood, not the king’s uncle, but the base conspirator, the soul of every cabal, who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood—not the prince nearest to the throne, not the king’s uncle, I repeat, but the murderer of Chalais, of Montmorency and of Cinq-Mars, who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary—instead of a man who threatened, a man who smiles.
“Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris!
This assurance determined the two friends to accept it.
“To her and to you!” cried D’Artagnan.
Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice.
“Well, I am in a maze,” said Porthos; “do _you_ approve of what D’Artagnan has done?”
“Yes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you.”

“No.”
“Sir,” replied Anne, with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence, “this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns!
“Because all gentlemen are brothers, because you are a gentleman, because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen, because the blind populace, ungrateful and brutal, always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them.
“Is it to your mind?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Good,” said he, as he went away; “this is a fruitful soil, and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.”
“Well, then,” said Monte Cristo “you have all the documents with you?”
In the middle of the choir the body of the victim, clothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed.
Yes, we are young; yes, we shall yet have happy days!
“Well, my lord, my friend has three magnificent estates: that of Vallon, at Corbeil; that of Bracieux, in the Soissonais; and that of Pierrefonds, in the Valois.

Then he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he required of him.
What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the society of such pagans?”
They might be said to be a procession of ghosts, for they were all wrapped in white cloaks.
D’Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk, for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform.
I must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles.”
“It seems to me,” returned the count, smiling, “that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.”
As for the world, it is a sepulcher and nothing else.”
Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight.
“They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.”
This voice was heard by the two friends, who set off, full gallop.
“And do you say this wedding is at hand?”
Armed men, shouldering muskets, watched over the barricades with menacing looks; words of command, patrols, arrests, executions, even, were encountered at every step.
Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers.
Ah!
“That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with pleasure undertake them.” The guests looked at each other.
“I don’t know him.”
She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by inches.
Talk only by gestures, or rather always listen.”
“Thanks, my friends, thanks!” cried Morrel gratefully; “take it—take it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are free to do so.”
“Bind my arms, my lord, fast.”
“They said she had left.”
He will spoil the feast.”
By the light of one of these torches D’Artagnan perceived men in uniform.
Go to!

“His lieutenant?
“Laporte,” said Anne of Austria, in an undertone, “find some very dull book to read to his majesty, but do not undress yourself.”
When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon.
“And you have them?”
“Well,” responded Porthos, “you may imagine, with the physique with which nature has endowed me, I am not in want of good luck.”
what will they leave him?
Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her.
“Three hundred pistoles.”
Adieu, your excellency; depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.”
The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for representation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia.
“True,” said Madame Danglars; “yet I think this will all pass off, and that you will one day see her enter your study.”
If you have two coats you will give me one of them.
“But I did not tell you there would be an answer, stupid!” said Athos.
“But,” he added, “in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung.”
“My lord,” said D’Artagnan, advancing toward the cardinal, “it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time.
Alas, no, I know not.
A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.
“Yes,” replied the count; “a felon named Caderousse.” Danglars turned slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing-room.
He was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have “kissed his mother earth.” It was dark, but at eleven o’clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, “ascending high,” played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion.
“That was not enough for those latitudes,” said the Englishman; “I should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.”
“Everything shall be done as you say, Athos.
He entered without knocking, or giving any other intimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master of the place.
“Everything goes on capitally, my dear Monsieur Bernouin, but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe place.”
“I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement.”

“She worries me everywhere,” said D’Artagnan.
“On my word,” said the inspector in a low tone, “had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.”
“I countenance nothing that is marvellous, M. Albert.
D’Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap.
“I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound soothes, where one is sure to be humbled, however proud may be his nature.
“What precaution?”
“What!
“Oh,” observed Madame de Villefort, “it must be an admirable anti-spasmodic.”
The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.
“Well,” said Aramis, “what think you about these two enemies whom it requires, besides Comminges’s troop, ten good soldiers to confront; are they not as like as two drops of water to D’Artagnan and Porthos?”
“Certainly; one of the most charming persons that lives—Mademoiselle Frances d’Aubigne.”
Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue.
“Which means that I have just been duped—sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour.”
“And when shall we know?” inquired Franz.

It was a quarter past midday.
That’s all plain enough.
Why I was here only ten or twelve days ago.
Chapter 48.
I must absolutely see it; I shall find a way.”
Chapter 67.
Raoul had been there about ten minutes, during five of which he was lost in reverie, when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face, who, with a napkin around his body, another under his arm, and a white cap upon his head, approached him, holding paper, pen and ink in hand.
In a few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will then no longer be under my care, and,” added he, with a sigh, “then you can do what you will with it.”
“The cellar—what cellar?”
“But you are sure you will promise me this?” said Morrel, intoxicated.
Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,” said Andrea.
Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de Bois-Tracy?” said D’Artagnan, wishing to have the air, in the eyes of the citizen, of being posted as to court affairs.
It was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most brilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.
“You mistrust me, then,” said Dantès.
“Impossible—you—a favorite of the minister!”
Grimaud obeyed without replying.
Two hours passed away.
All Gascon as he was, D’Artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood.
All had plainly seen a woman’s head appear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him.
What do you want of me?” she asked, in great distress.
He was thought to be dead; his wife, especially, who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow, stoutly maintained that death had taken him.
“Now the scent bag of white satin, on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls.”
He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking.
A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.
“Listen, friend,” said Monte Cristo.
“The devil!
As they entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the firelight, the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio.
“Then I have leave?”
“Well, be on our side now,” resumed Aramis.
“Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your majesty mean?”
“‘Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every difficulty,’ said the captain.
“You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools to aid you.”
This was a blow to D’Artagnan.
“My faith,” said Aramis, “we are all alike.
The shudder of the three musketeers showed to D’Artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them.
I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess, while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition.”
“Madame,” answered the youth in his sweet voice, “it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman—that of the army.
The boat was built for speed; her two paddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird.
“They were,” replied Mordaunt.
do not surrender, egad!
A freezing politeness, a strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,—these were the elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.
“At them!” echoed De Guiche.
“A king,” said D’Artagnan; “it’s a good omen, Master Groslow—look out for the king.”
Mazarin and Guitant conversed together in whispers.
“To what purpose?”
Morrel, amazed, let fall Monte Cristo’s hand.
There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant, but that Porthos was not at Bracieux.
“That is he, except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white; do you know him?” asked the host.
The officer looked at me with astonishment, and then said, ‘What is your business with me, monsieur?
Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand.
Three is just my number!”
that’s another thing,” said D’Artagnan, “and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in question.
“Yes,” was the reply, in a low voice.
“Well, what of that?”
“I know you do not like to converse in our language,” replied the envoy.
“But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame de Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me.”
D’Artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies.
I have augmented our fortune, and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years, till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it,—without any fault of mine, I can honestly declare.
“Yes indeed,” said Porthos.
Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen.
He returned speedily, advised the prisoner to be more careful, and departed.
Dantès told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take the helm.
“Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men have been reduced to misery.”
I have seen the Bastille.
“Four conveyed him away, I don’t know where—to the Bastille or Fort l’Evêque.
What do you say to it?”
D’Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes.
The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key; but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed.
Our Athos, who was as virtuous as Scipio?
He has followed us several times, as I think, when I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her home.”
“‘_Oh, God!_’” he read, “‘_preserve my memory!_’”
“As to myself, I shall go around to see Athos; for though I don’t think his aid worth much, one must with one’s friends observe all due politeness,” said D’Artagnan.
Villefort drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed:
From the day I first saw you, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection.
They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants.”
I will have him come in, if you really wish it.”
“It was an ambuscade!” shouted D’Artagnan.
“No, not to you, so I am going to tell you where he is.”
We have met him twice at General Cromwell’s.
Second, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then surrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage.
“I am.”
“Yes.”
“The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was——”
“Here it is, sir,” and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief, tied at each corner.
Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.
“It was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.
One minute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it to you through the grating of the door.
The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France.
“No.”
This horrible place contained fifty cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell, and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now number 34.
Bazin became a lay brother.
“De Bracieux de Pierrefonds,” added Porthos.
Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing.
“She has fainted.
Aramis, you think that D’Artagnan, that Porthos, would lend their hands to such an infamy?”
“Yes, I understand, the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of Pierrefonds; but console yourself, I will soon conduct you to one much better.”
“Mazarin!” replied D’Artagnan, bursting into a laugh.
“Mr.
On her side, but as softly as possible, Kitty turned the key of the lock, and then D’Artagnan opened the closet door.
“We divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each.”
“I am an old soldier of Rocroy, my lord.”
This calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered Caderousse.
He proceeded, nevertheless, and came opposite to an iron gate, ornamented in the taste of the period.
D’Artagnan, with a sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence.
Then, wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without ceasing.
“You know that my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions.
Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”
“I am ready to accompany you, sir,” said Maximilian.
“Now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate.
“Very well; I will go.
But the wind was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore.
I suppose the count has the tastes of the day?”
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition, “while Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together.
I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen, of the ornaments, of the journey you made with three of your friends.”
The Third Attack Chapter 20.
“Yes.”
The burning Marseilles sun, which shot into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of light.
She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once.
“None, whatever,” replied the other, drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot.
“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.
“This evening?” asked Milady, roused from her reverie by these words.
here?”
“But, my dear love, reflect a little upon what you require of me.
“Then it was to go to her that you left us?” said Aramis.
Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses.
I was trying on my wedding suit.
“Yes, as an Augustine monk.”
Then turning to Aramis, he said:
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting.
The Third Attack
You then served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor—it was your duty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him—it is equally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?”
In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois, who were coming to find their masters.
We every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork, and some meat when he asks for it; but alas!
“Who is it?”
“Sir,” replied he, “if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction, you should have gone at once to the point, and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour.
“Who are you, sir,” he asked, “that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death?
I say that according to all probability I shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La Rochelle, and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either Monsieur de Condé, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant gentleman whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which I have no aptitude.
The court of his hôtel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier, resembled a camp from by six o’clock in the morning in summer and eight o’clock in winter.
He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower.
“Can I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?”
“We are rich.
It was to that obedience I owe her portrait.”
“‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”
“Before a siege?”
“It is not for me to say.”
You are stupid,” replied the cardinal.
My daughter is only seventeen years old, and your son twenty-one.
“Now, my lord, let us enter, if you please.”
“One plan occurred to me,” continued Albert; “Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written in the most alluring style, he invariably answered: ‘My eccentricity may be great, but it will not make me break my promise.’”
“But if he had escaped?”
I saw him yesterday; your friend’s lackey was leading him.’ ‘Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles?’ ‘Yes!
Then he became alarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a change of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated to Versailles.
“If it be so,” replied the magistrate, “rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled.
“That will do me great honor,” said the leader of the posse, “and I accept thankfully.”
“It is impossible,” said Maximilian, “that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions.
Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow, before which the bandits bowed.
“Because I judge it from the past.”
Ah, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.” And D’Artagnan, making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.
“Alas,” returned Villefort, “I must!”
At this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out, he put the knife into his bosom.
“You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?”
I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, I resolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.”
A mantle-piece, with two modern Sèvres vases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with an engraving on each side—one representing Homer carrying his guide, the other, Belisarius begging—a grayish paper; red and black tapestry—such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore’s drawing-room.
Broussel had been conducted out of Paris without further resistance, and was at this time in the prison of Saint Germain; while Blancmesnil, who was arrested at the same time, but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise, was safe in the Castle of Vincennes.
But Felton—that’s another thing.
“But,” replied Franz, “this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which, to tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?”
It had glided down it, tearing the robe, and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs.
The count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where they conversed long and earnestly together.
“‘Yes, yes, I!’ replied he.
“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès.
“Then it must be a man of a certain age.”
“Fernand.”
my God!
“When are you coming to the point?” cried the baroness, shivering with anger and impatience.
“Into what room did you take him?”
Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.
“A hundred pistoles!
He cast himself on his knees, seized the hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips.
“If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till after you.”
“Trousers,” said Grimaud, still squaring his accounts.
“Still,” replied Porthos.
Is it not so?”
“So much the worse for them,” said Porthos.
My friend, who was seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or taken her by force, at his will—for he was master.
Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude.
And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself, Grimaud set off at full speed; whilst, enchanted at being all together again, the friends awaited his return.
I was taken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich Armenian.
“Who?”
Dantès saluted Villefort and retired.
La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner.
“Undeceive yourself, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish.
“Blond?”
I am credited on you for six millions.
He first advanced towards the baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come alone, Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to Eugénie, whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist was quite struck.
“Is that monsieur?” said D’Artagnan to himself.
Believe soft-spoken gentlemen again!
“Yes,” thought Planchet, “to treat me as a prince.
“Yes, sir,” answered Caderousse; “and remorse preys on me night and day.
Morrel extended his hand.
“No,” replied Athos, “it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear.”
“Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,” said the astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.
“All right; if he comes back you will kill him, you are so skillful and so brave.”
The curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper, and a penknife.
“‘Yes, my lord.’
OFFICER
“What?” asked Athos.
The Room of the Retired Baker
In the position of Porthos, D’Artagnan would have been perfectly happy; and to make Porthos contented there was wanting—what?
He could not be mistaken; Milady was in it.
“But you said,” replied Madame Danglars, “he would require it as a proof.”
However, he remained standing, clinging to a window.
Nothing was changed.
During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.
“What!” exclaimed Porthos “without supper?
“But,” said Monte Cristo “do you not know any cause for this hatred?”
See, I have sold my watch for 100 francs, and the guard and seals for 300.
Bonacieux.
“What do you mean, Aramis?”
“Don’t let him escape!” said a loud voice.
“Come, now,” said Athos, “you are joking.”
“I’m afraid we are prisoners,” whispered D’Artagnan to his friend.
Ask M. de Morcerf into the drawing-room,” said he to Baptistin, while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase.
“One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my cousin, my brother; it is Fernand—the man whom, after you, Edmond, I love the best in the world.
Well, Monsieur La Ramee, you shall judge of it yourself and at once.’ ‘I cannot,’ I replied; ‘it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau.’ ‘Very well,’ said he, ‘go and attend to your affairs, since you seem to be in a hurry, but come back in half an hour.’ ‘In half an hour?’ ‘Yes, have you breakfasted?’ ‘Faith, no.’ ‘Well, here is a pate that will be ready for you, with a bottle of old Burgundy.’ So, you see, my lord, since I am hungry, I would, with your highness’s leave——” And La Ramee bent low.
I fear I shall be forced to suspend payment.”
“Do you prefer I should seek M. d’Épinay?”
“Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni?”
“At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?”
do you again defy me?”
my left side still pains me!”
If you went to Spain, would you not see the bull-fights?
“Ja!” replied the Gascon, determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German tongue.
They found Athos in profound despondency; Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at D’Artagnan, without speaking, but the latter understood his meaningful look.
“Of course, that is perfectly just,” cried M. de Boville.
“Yes.”
Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo.
“Stay there,” said Aramis; “I shall return immediately.”
“_Perhaps_ is too much,” said D’Artagnan, smiling.
you really vilify me!” cried Olivain.
“Make haste, dear lodger,” said he; “there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs; and you know women don’t like to be kept waiting.”
20081m
“Caderousse stammered out something, while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow.
Neither had his eyes bandaged.
Ah!
During the reading of this, which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards Andrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern.
“He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.”
“You are examining my den,” said Aramis.

The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people, some playing, some drinking, some talking.
“Four o’clock.”
D’Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived Aramis.
“Yes, I promised you.” The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to him.
“Such words as those belong to your profession,” answered Caderousse, “and you do well to repeat them; but,” added he, with a bitter expression of countenance, “one is free to believe them or not, as one pleases.”
“That’s love, or I don’t know what love is.”
Where does he live?”

“Well?” said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count.
“Monsieur Mordaunt!” exclaimed the Gascon, surprised.
...ried in a place he knows
Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy.
“Swear to nothing.
“Perhaps it is some political difference?”
_La Jeune Amélie_ left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Corsica.

Milady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her.
The queen then began to read, and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes, dismissed her.
“Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”
If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there, too; whereas, ’tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds, dying with hunger and thirst.”
“Monsieur Baptistin,” said the count, “you have been in my service one year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me.
“Yes,” replied the angry look.
Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father’s name before Haydée?
Chapter LVI.
Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to anyone.”
“Madame,” said he, “the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action.
“Morrel,” muttered Albert—“Morrel—who is he?”
It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker’s as the betrothed.
I’m certain of it; were it not for that, I should thank you, for you have worked for us.
“You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.”
“The balance would come to about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.”
“Zounds!
“And now,” he said, when he saw that Dantès had read the last line, “put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.” Dantès obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:
“Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything?
The door soon opened and the accused appeared.
The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her.
A shudder passed over him.
Every five minutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to seven.
“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.”
“Oh,” said Danglars, “I can, when circumstances render it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice.
“Albert,” said the journalist, “these are questions which it is difficult to answer.”
“No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.”
“Exactly; that was the title.”

“You are mistaken in thinking so,” returned Franz calmly; “but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders,—I mean that of judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess—nothing more.”
With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea’s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him.
“No.” said Albert, “the engagement is broken off.”
“And now that you have obtained what you want, go,” said she, “Monsieur de Gondy.”
“No other than your friend, Monte Cristo.”
“Who brought it into this room, then?”
“No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible.
Mazarin wrote a few words, which he gave to this man; then he bowed.
The executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground, laid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four corners, lifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.
“I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.”
The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the step to embrace me a last time; my brother’s servant, who comes to fetch me, is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion, and we set off at a gallop.”
He was not rich, although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public rumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.
“Trust me,” said Aramis, “do not expect to find anything in Abbeville.
“Has she made a fortune also?” inquired the abbé, with an ironical smile.
“I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his Majesty’s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift an anchor.”
Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light.
“No, madame, something easier to grant.”
They then set off for Rueil.
“You see the address,” said the queen, speaking so low that Mme.
“An apology on the ground!” said the young captain, shaking his head.
The bars were filled with drinkers.
“What does he say?” grumbled Porthos.
Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how to understand the old man quickly.
You do not know your own good fortune!”
“Fifty thousand francs for being your father?
“Everywhere.
They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound.
“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand.
We have promised and we will keep our promise.
Felton approached her, and said, “Lord de Winter, who is a Catholic, like yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book which contains the ritual.”
“Ah!
‘I give you 45,000 francs—that is, 2,500 livres of income,—a fortune such as I wish I had myself, and you are not satisfied!’
“I had a large hat,” said Aramis.
CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY Chapter LVI.
D’Artagnan’s arm dropped to his side.
“But Raoul?” said Aramis.
The sun, already high, penetrated into the room through the window, the curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening.
“Ah,” sighed Caderousse, “a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married.”
Long life to his Eminence!
But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti.

“But don’t mistake,” said D’Artagnan, “there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think—for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received.
“Perhaps.”
“We came here with the intention of asking for something to eat.”
This movement was observed by Mordaunt.
“Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father’s mind is really impaired,” said Villefort.
“The day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,” resumed the cardinal.
The discourse being finished, the queen remained silent.
My affianced husband returned.
“Thank you,” said the young man.
“What makes you think so?”
I ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own.”
“And I also,” said Franz.
A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard.
“An abdication?” repeated Anne; “I thought, sir, that it was kings alone who abdicated!”
And still further, it is very probable I should not have done anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.”
I have it with me.”
“They are Spanish smugglers,” said he; “they have with them two Corsican bandits.”
The hour, then, for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived.
“Bravi!
“What!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Hush!” said Athos.
In short, what shall I say to you, Felton?” continued Milady, in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime.
The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors; and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter.
Porthos remained silent and motionless.
It was, in fact, a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne.
“About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.”
Can I not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you would never have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself; and which, instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality, will be accompanied with acclamations, with bravos, and with flowers?
have we ceased to be men?”
“Doubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune.”
“My lord,” replied Haydée, “I never will leave you, for I am sure I could not exist without you.”
“I thought so, my lord,” said Felton; “but as the prisoner is a woman, after all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman, if not on her account, at least on my own.”
The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him.
At first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the king’s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased, when cries of “Down with Mazarin!” “Long live Broussel!” “Long live Blancmesnil!” resounded through the city.
The nations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror similar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was compelled to say, ‘I am the angel of the Lord’; and the other, ‘I am the hammer of God,’ in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed.”
“What’s the knot for?” thought Dantès.

I have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him.
I made inquiries, and found that the house in the Champs-Élysées is his own property, and certainly it was very decently kept up.
Thus I was able, thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces, to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the queen.”
“How so?”
“Are you not,” he asked, “the priest who here in the Château d’If is generally thought to be—ill?”
“I see how it will be,” said Athos: “we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now.
“His father was introduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I do not think he has much claim to that title.”
“What shall we do?” said Debray; “we have only one Monthyon prize.”
Around the schooner lay a number of small fishing-boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village, like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen.
Is it not tempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus?
“So far good, monseigneur; but afterwards?”
“Yes,” replied Morcerf, “but that will plunge my mother into positive grief.”
“Come, come,” said Andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there is no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;” and he held out his hands to be manacled.

“They are all the same price.”
“‘You are a prostitute,’ said he, in a voice of thunder, ‘and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes!
On the next day Mathieu Molé, the chief president, whose courage at this crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de Condé—in other words, of the two men who were considered the bravest in France—had been attacked in his turn.
Take them, and if you need money for your expedition, sell them fearlessly, my lord.
“My dear fellow, don’t speak like that of Monsieur Groslow.
Until then you will not see me.
“Well, yes,” replied Raoul.
“Upon what?” asked Porthos.
“It must be done,” said Athos; then in a lower and more gentle voice, he added.
We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor.
“Well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters, for which we will draw lots.
“Ah!
“It is singular,” said the doctor; “I was not aware that Madame de Saint-Méran was subject to such hallucinations.”
“He must sell them at whatever price.”
“My dear viscount,” said Monte Cristo gravely, “you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places I have been at your disposal, but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you.”
“The bandits shouted with laughter.
He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it.
There is no occasion to tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away, beyond seas.
He bounded like a chamois, cocking his carbine as he went, and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller.
“Well, the abbé—the Abbé Busoni.” Monte Cristo took off the wig which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features.
The bed was the only one in the apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom.
your horse is tired already, he froths at the mouth, whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable.
“What?
“Muster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it more.”
“Your family appears to be a very happy one,” said the count, as if speaking to himself.
“No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone out, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter, which he had brought with him already sealed.”
Felton, let me die!”
This force was therefore wholly insufficient, and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty.
“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no, no.”
I have a hundred pounds’ weight less upon my chest.
Danglars shuddered.
“Not my own wish, mother, but reason—necessity.
“And did you convey this answer to your guest?”
“Ah,” said he, “you have remarked—”
In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct, followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with terror.
“Recall Le Plessis, Bellievre, Villequier and D’Erlac,” said the prince, “recall all the troops that are on this side of the Lys.

Why, three days ago the emperor had not landed.”
As we have already said, Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France.
“No, Bartolomeo, his father.”
“My faith!
It is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the contrary, we are all free agents.”
Excuse my not coming to meet you; but,” added he, looking at D’Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, “you know what has happened to me?”
“Yes; and as I am just now excessively annoyed, I shall go from home.
“Alas, you will find it so yourself,” said Aramis, with a sigh.
Come now, do smile, instead of looking at me so solemnly.
La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up, but the duke remarked that it would be losing time; and going near the rampart himself and looking over, he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat.
“Indeed, you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration.
“Well,” replied the latter, blushing, “what must I say?”
The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea occurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father.
The contract was read during a profound silence.
“Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother.
“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door.
D’Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the Musketeer’s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it.
What?—after the varied relations I have had the happiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing?
“Capital!
“How should he have been otherwise?
“Here is his receipt.
“Are you going to leave us, count?” said Madame de Villefort.
“I saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the well-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but twice.
“Follow the culprit’s steps; he first kills M. de Saint-Méran——”
Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by a last hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such persuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide in him.
“Let me hear, then,” said the count, “who this deeply regretted son was; for I always understood you were a bachelor.”
The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the drawers of which was partly open.
“What has become of him?
He is, doubtless, come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague.
“Oh, dear, no, your excellency!
“Until that time,” continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed tone of voice, “we will conform to circumstances, and be guided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it expresses all I wish to convey,—we will wait.”
“This was done instantly.
“No, I remain,” replied Athos, with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed.
In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends.
“I have measures to take.”
“P.
“Petition the minister.”
Bazin looked down and started, as if he had seen a serpent.
“He will ask you what you want, and you will answer by these two words, ‘Tours’ and ‘Bruxelles.’ He will at once put himself at your orders.”

The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated what the concierge had said.
“We let them tell their story out,” replied Mousqueton.
“The devil take this gout!” cried Monsieur de Bouillon, evidently ill at ease.

ESCAPE Chapter LIX.
Porthos blushed, but with pleasure rather than with confusion; and yet, bowing his head, as if humiliated, he said:
With this consoling idea, I leave you, madame, and most prudent wife, without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you; you have friends left, and the ashes I have already mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to you.
The other was forced to wait, and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay.
“Alas, no!” said Mme.
“What’s the matter?” asked Aramis.
“Is what true, madame?” inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.
With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper:
One terrible idea pressed upon her mind,—that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again.
I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.”
“Well, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur d’Artagnan; we shall see each other again after the campaign.
Section 3.
“But I repeat it again to you,” replied Felton, in great emotion, “no danger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.”
It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy, they would like him all the better for it; but that Athos, on the contrary, would despise him.
Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived.
“Why, I think there were not many intruders.
The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side, saw the young peasants, and galloping up, began to question them.
“My father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made, and tore up one of the planks entire.
Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder.
Imprudent, thrice imprudent!”
Now let us return to your particular world.
Be one or the other, but not both,” replied Porthos.
“That he may be at ease.”
“Ah, yes!
“Indeed, sir,” said Milady, “you must be either drunk or mad.
“Oh, sir,” said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,—“three letters of unlimited credit!
“Oh, yes,” returned the young man, smiling; “on the contrary, I have one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue Meslay.”
And he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop, snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out, with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe:
Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you.”

“Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.”
“I have sent for one,” replied the abbé.
“That is true, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king, “and you were right, as you always are; but the queen, not the less, deserves all my anger.”
D’Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority.
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, “let us inquire further.
“Ah, depreciate other persons’ dinners; you ministers give such splendid ones.”
“’Tis your fault, you simpleton,” answered the duke.
“Come in,” exclaimed D’Artagnan; and another servant entered.
“You will, then, come on Saturday?”
“Manage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern me, the more so as I have not a livre left.”
“‘Yes,’ replied M. Danglars, ‘I believe he is the son of the old shipowner.’”
“Will M. Danglars be there?”
“You don’t comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me?”
Nevertheless, his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.
Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida, and the Chinese eat swallows’ nests?
“Tender hearts!

He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire, drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken.
That is all I had to say to you.”
What these happy persons took for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous, so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight foretaste.”
“That’s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we going, may I ask, without being too curious?”
CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
“Yes, there were some people on the way who delayed me.
“I obey, I obey, sir!” cried Broussel, trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son, who seemed determined to dispute authority.
“I am her best friend.”
You must have much reason to complain of him.”
“Here,” said Caderousse, “draw me all that on the paper, my boy.”
Albert instantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary host of Monte Cristo.
“Yes.”
you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I cannot walk.
“It would be fatal to his interests.”
“Your excellency,” said Peppino, addressing the count, “if you will follow me, the opening of the catacombs is close at hand.”
“Or spent the money?”
“A corridor.”
You have seen the count, you say?”
Milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent.
“Sir,” said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, “you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here.

For a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments.
“M.
“As long as they are in prison all will be well,” said Anne, “but one of these days they will get out.”
She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain; she believes in dreams.
Is he at home?”
“What can they have done with him?”
“But, my dear count, has M. Danglars any reason?”
“That is easily done,” said Aramis.
“Yes.”
In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit.
“Go and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine.
Mazarin thought for an instant.
He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom he had not brought, that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo.
“And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?”
“Oh, I shall always love you.
When the count arrived, he had under his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the antechamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with their music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the sleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them, we leave a part of our souls.
_Ma foi_, I haven’t consulted my daughter; but if she has good taste——”
“But,” continued Aramis, “the details escape me.”
On my soul, handsome stirrups!
The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back, groaning, upon his bed.
Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.
“See, Planchet,” said he, “these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like you.”
“No; and you, Athos?”
“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?

“Oh, madame, do not think that!”
“Is the Baron Franz d’Épinay.”
In Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an event.
“Come, come, sleepy head; quick, the ladder!”
“I supposed,” said Athos, “that last night’s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements.”
“You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-Cattini; here is the priest’s certificate.”

Encouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer.
“The discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen,” said the count, unceremoniously.
“What!” exclaimed D’Artagnan, “does the queen, surrounded as she is by such devoted servants, such wise counselors, men, in short, so great by merit or position—does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier?”
And here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.
“No doubt; but they will fight, none the less, if only to mask the conferences.”
“The deuce!
“Ah, monsieur, I have not here, as I had there, the ponds of monsieur le prince, where I could catch those beautiful carp, nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges.
By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.
D’Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.
“You are not mistaken; I recognize Monsieur de Flamarens.”
“Does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday?”
“And yet, without the man, the king would have been rescued.”
“Sir,” said Planchet when he saw D’Artagnan on the summit of the ladder, “this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses cannot mount the ladder.”
The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.
Have you admired the rapidity of my fall?
“Oh, yes!”
Mousqueton, who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau, wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner.
you think so, do you?”
She heard the count’s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors, and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddesses.”
“Oh, mon Dieu!
Another flash illuminated all around them.
“Yes, yes, I see him well enough,” said D’Artagnan.
After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle, and turning to Athos, Aramis and Winter, said:
“Word of honor?”
Assunta took care of all, and our little fortune increased.
Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the man who had spoken to him.
“The young man is right; let the prisoner be brought in.”
There were moments when, looking at Grimaud, the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action.
The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession, and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing.
“That is the misfortune!

“I?—not in the least, I beg you to believe.
“Ah, sir,” replied Mousqueton, his eyes filling with tears, “why did you re-enter the army?
“Who is speaking of Monsieur D’Artagnan?” asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room.
He had wept all night long, but would not show his grief before the people.
“P.S.—Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for you—for you as Aramis.”
Milady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet.
“And the yacht.”
D’Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy.
“It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry with me, for you have sought this disclosure.
When he was only eleven, he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst characters in Bastia, or, indeed, in Corsica, and they had already, for some mischievous pranks, been several times threatened with a prosecution.
The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation, which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel.
“No; and you, Porthos?”
“Where am I?” said she.
“That’s all you know of him?” asked Mazarin.
“What to do?”
“That you inherit from your mother.”
At that moment Porthos entered.
“Go!” said the queen.
“You know the environs of Paris, then?”
“You have known him for some time, then?”
During the first act, the Countess G—— entered.
It was a superb moonlight night.
“I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions?”
“I think so, indeed; we should be hard to please if we were not.
The lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.
At the door stood two horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped.
“And now I am convinced,” said D’Artagnan, “that this abduction of the queen’s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris.”
You’ll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow.”
“What,” said he, “is it you, my dear Franz, whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?”
But as we have said he was active, strong, and full of presence of mind.
De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse.
For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven.
It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal; Monsieur de Tréville must think us dead.”
“Oh, she is perfectly lovely—what a complexion!
“You do not guess?”
“I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond.
1.E.
“And I caught it, mamma, don’t you remember?” interposed Edward, “and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.”
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction?”
“No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an attack of catalepsy, and died.”
’tis a comfort,” said the Gascon, “since we shall not die of thirst.
How much were your animals worth, Porthos?”
“What is your name?”
The steward made a gesture that signified, “I do not know.” The notary looked at the count with astonishment.
The age of this singular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.
You look at me and you are going to laugh at me.”
Now, I am going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose too.
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?
“Ah, true.”
“Why do you doubt?”
“Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon, and to tell them about this.”
They still laugh at them in France, and yet always wear them, for all that.”
Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin, the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie.
Chapter XXXVIII.
“What the devil would you have me do with that?” said the Englishman.
“‘Teresa,’ said Luigi, ‘yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count’s daughter.’
“I?—not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest _Messager_ was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced telegraphic despatches.”
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to decline, carriages were passing and repassing.
“Pardon me, D’Artagnan,” he said.
It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined.”
Meanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone, prepared to depart, when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment:
“Zounds, monsieur!
“Long live the Duc de Beaufort!” cried the sentinels.
Andrea shrugged his shoulders.
It is the talk of all Paris.”
“I ask no better,” said Aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself; “but let me be properly acquainted with the subject.
“By me.”
“Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?”
What must I answer?”
“Consider all this done.
Section 4.
This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands.”
“No, madame, I was ignorant of that,” said the musketeer.
“General, I wished to see the ceremony to the end, which delayed me.”
“Until one of us dies,” repeated Monte Cristo, moving his head slightly up and down.
“The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d’Herblay,” said Aramis.
At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man.
You see I am obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease.
I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me.
Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh, Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow, cried out to him to yield.
“And where are you going?”
He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis.
“I faint?
“To the Champs-Élysées,” said the general; “the Count of Monte Cristo’s.
You would think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?”
“Under the name of Athos.
As to Athos, he remained unmoved.
ah!” said Porthos to Mordaunt, “I think we have you now, my hero!
“You are a brave youth, D’Artagnan,” interrupted the cardinal, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature.
“I beg your pardon, madame.
I took the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that they were two noble steeds.”
“Somebody said to me, ‘You are Monsieur d’Artagnan?’ I answered, ‘You think so?’ My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it.
“Yes,” murmured Flamarens, lowering his eyes.
When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass.
you are right—a mute from the East!
“But what shall you do with him?”
“What do you mean by having made a stiff?—having assassinated a man?” said Franz, continuing his investigation.
“You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger?
Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman, around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing, pale and menacing.
But De Winter did not call; crushed, enfeebled, he remained standing and with listening ear; then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair, saying:
“Yes,” replied Morcerf, “he said something about it to me.”
“You!” cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; “you, M. Noirtier—you killed my father?”
He was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with which he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought, they should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at his door.
At the Rue Guénégaud she called a cab, and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay.
As for Porthos, on whom D’Artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend, which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos, he was simply mute.
Buckingham was their Messiah.
“On the contrary, we shall meet again,” said Mercédès, pointing to heaven with solemnity.
Comminges went out with a soldier’s passive obedience.
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen.
The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey.
“Everything is possible,” said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on which he had been sitting; “even,” he added in an inaudible voice, “even that the procureur be not dead.
The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues.
I sleep no longer, monsieur.
“In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.”
“Ah, this time,” cried D’Artagnan, springing to his sword, “this time he will not escape me!”
The count again struck the gong.
Valery; but listen.
Mon Dieu!
The ballet was called _Poliska_.
“Your address at Paris?”
But now answer me.
“Well?” said the queen.
“Everyone expected an explosion on Carlini’s part; but to their great surprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and filling it,—
“And now what is to be done?” asked the queen, “for I hear them.”
Come, my dear Bazin, tell me where he is.”
“Bah!” said Athos, “God is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and the future is in his hands.”
The horses only arrived at two o’clock, and the _cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three.
“The executioner is still in the cellar, where, I presume, he has had an interview with mine host’s bottles.
“Certainly, I excuse you,” said Monte Cristo graciously, “and pocket them.” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.
“Well, Caderousse, it is Monte Cristo.”
“Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream,” said Beauchamp; “let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes.”
She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure; she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening.
Chapter 24.
Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress.
I would rather find it triply bolted.”
“M.
“Parry,” said the king, rising too, “my horse; I desire to go to Thirsk.”
40160m
Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open; he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men.
“Yes,” said he at length, “it is so.
By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantès saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves.
Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness; Valentine looked at him a moment with her large, scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart.
“This is the point of departure; it is a syllogism.
“Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all probability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty, as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the idea.”
“Weep,” said Athos, “weep, heart full of love, youth, and life!
The Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he could not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield.
Around him, and in groups, according to their fancy, lying in their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of stone bench, which went all round the columbarium, were to be seen twenty brigands or more, each having his carbine within reach.
More than this, the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them.
“Morrel,” said the count to him at length, “do you repent having followed me?”
As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted.
When you leave this you will behold my men at work.
He who was thus looking, without being heard or seen, probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerf’s apartments.
“On the contrary, it is of her.
You, Edmond, on the contrary,—you are still young, handsome, dignified; it is because you have had faith; because you have had strength, because you have had trust in God, and God has sustained you.
“Yes, your purveyor, Godeau—the purveyor of the Musketeers.”
“This is the order,” he said.
Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door.
“And I, Monsieur de Chatillon.”
Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
“Athos, you are becoming mad.”
“No,” returned the count.
Yes, there is something in what you say; nevertheless, do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in love.”
“The devil!
Yes—that is a great word, sir.
“By circumstances?”
“Go, Monsieur de Bragelonne,” said the queen, “and rest assured of our affection.”
Then, the effort having exhausted her strength, she fell, not asleep this time, but fainting on the floor.
“So are all Italians.”
Well, here’s the case, here’s where the saddle hurts me, as we French say.
“Ah, that is a different thing.”
but how can the news be brought to you?”
“Wait, wait, young man; do not fatigue yourself with speaking.
“She must be a princess then.”
Tomorrow, perhaps, he may change you.
What say you, Franz?”
Here at least,” said Athos, pointing to the bastion, “they will not come and disturb us.”
We can talk while performing that necessary task.
D’Artagnan trembled lest Planchet, seduced, like the crow in the fable, should tell his name, and that the queen, knowing his name, would discover that Planchet had belonged to him.
“She is gone,” said he; “she must have returned to the Louvre.”
“Do you know whom I have encountered here?”
“It is past noon,” said she, “and today is Saturday; I dare say it is the doctor, grandpapa.”
The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand, put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.
“If it’s Parry,” said the bishop, “I have nothing to fear; so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am come.”
“Stop,” exclaimed Villequier, “so Mazarin was here!
“But where and when shall I see you again?” cried D’Artagnan.
“Is included in this sum.”
The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with great anxiety.
“Did your excellency desire to see me?” inquired he.
“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with his most ingratiating smile.
“Madame,” he said, “I am an abbé, it is true, but I am so against my will.
“What!
“_Pardieu!_ Know it!” replied D’Artagnan, who knew nothing about it, but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on.
The halt at Noyon was but brief, every one there being wrapped in profound sleep.
He turned up a king.
He approached the window, and saw his father get into it, and drive away.
“‘No,’ returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse, ‘no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered so much, for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen.
40179m
“And who charges me with this, monseigneur?” said D’Artagnan, who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady, “a woman branded by the justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me!”
Michon, seamstress, Tours_.”
“Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; “I did not perceive that there were three of us.” Then, turning to Mercédès, he inquired, “Who is this gentleman?”
I will look at it again;” and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress on each word as he proceeded.
Franz continued:
So, suiting the action to the word, D’Artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard, picked up his hat and ran down the stairs, followed by the others.
Happiness almost stifles me!”
“But what is the matter with my hands!” asked Milady; “it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice.”
“And you come?” asked Milady.
“This diamond was to have been shared among his friends.
“Idiot!” muttered Danglars; “whether she kill herself or not, what matter, provided Dantès is not captain?”
What is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?
When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement.
“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.
“LA HOUDINIERE, _Captain of the Guards_”
On your knees, count.”
“Oh, gentlemen,” said the host, “I have been wrong.
Danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),—Danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror.
“Yes; but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France,” replied the queen.
“It is this,” answered Athos, with a trembling voice.
Remember your promise.”
“Will you depart—will you depart, if I give you that you demand?”
“And yet you said he had money.”
Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground, and he kept exclaiming, “He ought to die!—he shall die!—I will not die alone!”
“To present our respects to the cardinal.”
“Nothing, nothing,” replied the priest; “go on.”
“But, my lord,” returned La Ramee, “what would you do if you got out?
Everyone looked at Carlini; the sheath at his belt was empty.
An opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher encouragement, it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored.
But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion; and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.
Monte Cristo took Albert into his study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself.
In all well-organized brains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be the last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning.
“Do you think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian?”
To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him, he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts; since he could not be a Bayard, he would become a Raphael or a Michael Angelo.
Roman Bandits
“For what?” said the count.
Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms.
Do you not see how she suffers?”
What did Mazarin do?”
I grasped the railings; if I had relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen.
The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner.
“Some wine!” cried the stupefied host, “some wine?
“Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you, vicomte; go and bow to her; don’t try to appear anything but what you are, a true country youth; on no account speak to her of Henry IV.”
Danglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping on that side.
Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a devil!
“Yes, you are right, Tréville, you are right!”
The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket, with a gesture of despair.
“He came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well, and to beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal*.”
As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore, who was precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck.
Yes, indeed, that’s the right thing.
“And I hate her,” said Château-Renaud.
What for five years he had been wanting—a faithful servant, a friend, a helping hand—seemed to have fallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least.
“Today, then, at eleven o’clock, your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay?”
Gondy looked at Mazarin, astonished, and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her, but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais Royal.
“Yes.”
Not the least in the world.”
“None.”
We went by Bologna, Perugia, and Rome.”
“I have just left the count, sir,” said he; “he is, doubtless, a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas.
As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of glass.
The half-pistole is ready,” and he put it back again into his pocket.
“This time the devil himself shall not save them,” rejoined Mordaunt.
“Each time you have applied to me,” said the doctor, “it has been too late; still I will go.
Mordaunt bowed.
The abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of Caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse, once more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells, and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming.
“You talk very comfortably,—a hundred and eighty leagues!”
“She is sure of it.”
That can be managed.”
“Are you going?”
“I have one thing to reproach myself with,” said he, stopping Albert on the steps.
What the devil can you do with all that?”
We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o’clock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall.
Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress.
As for Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket-handkerchief.
Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?
“And if it were an interrogatory!” replied the cardinal.
He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink.
The Island of Monte Cristo
Do you keep a journal?”
“Yes.”
“Yes,” continued Caderousse, “so it is; after five-and-twenty years of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his only hope now is in that very _Pharaon_ which poor Dantès commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo.
I am tired,” cried D’Artagnan, sitting down.
Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock; ’twas a thrust from a sword, but his cuirass turned aside the blow.
“Never?”
“The affair is still in projection.”
D’Artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly, whilst Porthos looked at him with starting eyes, not daring to ask a single question.
I could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer’s.
Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to him, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition.
“Come,” continued D’Artagnan, who, irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts, “you have never found yourself the worse for my advice.
D’Artagnan went up to him; with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance.
“Buckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to Spain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I., who was then only Prince of Wales.
I have lost even the knife that saved me.
This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who had just designated him by the name of Aramis.
Athos and Aramis looked at each other.
Planchet had no need to learn more.
I thank you for having recognized me, sir.” Debray stepped forward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor.
“Then,” said Haydée, proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristo’s question and Albert’s answer, “then I will speak either in French or Italian, if my lord so wills it.”
And you, Porthos?”
“I did not like to say so,” answered Dantès, smiling.
“By my soul,” said Aramis, “she is charming.
At the end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.
“I will place it on her table myself tonight,” he murmured.
“Oh, heavens,” cried Beauchamp, “the minister quotes Béranger, what shall we come to next?”
On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of his oath.
You do not know her,” replied the stranger.
La Ramee became, therefore, the duke’s dinner guest by compulsion—an eternal keeper, the shadow of his person; but La Ramee—gay, frank, convivial, fond of play, a great hand at tennis, had one defect in the duke’s eyes—his incorruptibility.
What!
0125m
Do you take me for half a woman?
“And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?”
D’Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him bewildered.
Villefort rushed into the room.
D’Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their companions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a woman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator’s wife, and D’Artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune—the best mistress possible.
Anne blushed and buried her face in her hands.
“Wait, sir, wait,” said Louis XVIII.
The Two Prisoners
“Because, my lord,” said Haydée eagerly, “my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness.”
He was never seen at the theatres, at concerts, or in any place of public resort.
“Oh, yes, yes!”
In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions, who were already in the boat; but when, after they had all got in, it came to his turn, there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel.
“My dear Albert,” said he, “let me introduce to you M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is more—however the man speaks for himself—my preserver.
“I shall return very safely to the Louvre all alone.”
Chapter 65.
D’Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded.
“They shall not have the king.”
MILADY’S SECRET
Athos went toward the house, while the mendicant, who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could carry him.
de Salvieux, my brother’s chamberlain?”
“Perhaps so.
“Go,” said he, in a subdued voice, “and find Rochefort.
“Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of D’Artagnan I should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself; and you would have done the same, Aramis.”
Five minutes after, M. de Tréville was asking D’Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour.
“You may, perhaps, be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars.”
“Ah ah!” said D’Artagnan, Planchet’s recital agreeing with his own observations.
By no means.
“I fear that is true,” said D’Artagnan, in a low tone.
“Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose?” he inquired.
“Thank you, sir, but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to lose.”
“Here, my lords!
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like himself, a dealer in magical arts.
ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS
“‘But never mind,’ continued Cucumetto, laughing, ‘sooner or later your turn will come.’ Carlini’s teeth clenched convulsively.
“So, then,” said he, “the letter was true to the end?”
Toward midday, Lord de Winter entered.
“_Mala ducis avi domum_,” continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.
You are in prison, then?”
All this must be prepared against.
Under pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade.
I tell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago, though she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier.
I don’t care to be shot in a box.”
“And I about ten pistoles,” said Aramis.
A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction.
Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force.
“Yes.
Ah!
Certainly not,” replied the count.
On the contrary, be off, and quickly.
Listen, madame, and recall your remembrances.
“No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then.
I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsed—but there will be a conference to-morrow and we shall see.”
When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.
Making no reply, Grimaud opened the poor man’s jacket to feel if the heart beat, whilst the host approached in his turn; but in a moment they both fell back, the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pallid.
He intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but the horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without anyone claiming money from the traveller.
Grimaud followed Athos.
“Adieu, then, till we meet again,” said Valentine, tearing herself away.
He is master of his arm, yet he strikes without remorse.”
“Oh, no!
To which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected; they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people’s misery.
Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcerf’s.
Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what suited her nature and her means.
“Monsieur,” said the prince, turning toward Raoul, “I know that you have a letter from my sister, Madame de Longueville; but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel.”
D’Artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods.
It was the man he called his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des Fossoyeurs and of Arras.
And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.
Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me to the queen?”
Making a sign to La Houdinière and Cahusac to stop, he alighted from his horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting.
Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes?”
The queen entered the great hall; and it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.
“No, certainly not,” said the count with a haughty expression.
“Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?”
“I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met M. Lucien Debray.”
“But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.”
“You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!” said Athos.
And why not?”
“No, no,” cried Maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings.
D’Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.
“Ay, that smells good!
A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship.
But instead of obeying him, the servants stood watching M. d’Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised her in his arms.
Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of their companions.
“And you say you will wait for me at Armentières?”
“Sign an order for his release, and all will be said,” replied the cardinal.
“You know, Porthos, I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends; to name them would be to commit them to ruin, so I merely said they were fifty and we were two.
While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I could.”
Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy.
“Yes,” said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair.
How fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch.
“No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks.”
“And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbé Busoni?”
For the rest, the orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted, and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving-stones.
“What am I to do, madame?”
God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom, and believe me, both will have their reward.
Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on.
“Madame Coquenard,” said Porthos, “remember the first letter you wrote me, and which I preserve engraved in my memory.”
“Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me 50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.”
“I learned that she had been assassinated by my relation, aided by four friends, but I was already aware that I had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by King Charles I.”
During the whole of this nocturnal ride, during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, Mazarin was, in truth, studying more especially one man.
“How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘A murder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘And we are on the track of the guilty persons.’”
“Yes, and the queen, too.”
A Signed Statement Chapter 76.
“But for the sake of the mother?” said the count.
Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole.
The three valets passed without accident.

“Meanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer jealous of me—”
Athos did not move.
“Yes, sir.”
“What did he say?” demanded Porthos.
Oh, do something for me.” The doctor flew to his patient.
For the assassination itself I had never felt any remorse.
“Was he placed here when he first arrived?”
“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner.
At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert’s establishment, although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great occasions the count’s _chasseur_ also.
He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ‘My son, the world was not made in a day—but in seven.
“The fact is, mademoiselle,” said Barrois, “I am dying with thirst, and since you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it.”
I shall take a cutlet on my way to the Chamber.”
Then they undressed him as they had done the first, laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bed—the bedstead being of oak.
“That is my condemnation,” thought D’Artagnan; “he will spare me the _ennui_ of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial.
At this sound, as he was already partially exposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely, remaining perfectly motionless.
But the latter went on without pity:
Do you see this firman?’—‘I do,’ said my father.
I do sometimes, soldier though I am.”
“Less quickly than the women, it seems to me,” replied Porthos; “for I, madame, I may say I was your victim, when wounded, dying, I was abandoned by the surgeons.
This cavalier is my attendant.”
The queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens.
They had reached the ladder which led to the boat.
“Well, my dear duke,” replied Louis XVIII., “I think you are wrongly informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine weather in that direction.” Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII.
You must take Grimaud and Olivain.”
“That did not come from a man without a heart.
“Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans, who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the _mulus_, and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish.
“You are welcome, sir, most welcome!” repeated the astonished Caderousse.
There was no time to lose.

Dantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his cell, and covered it with earth.
“Ah!
One of the sailors got down the side of the ship, seized the cable, and drew it; it came without the least resistance.
To the wall; to the wall!”
Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table?”
“Nothing.”
Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied.
At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock, as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody.
Ah, I miss three, they were here last night, sir—I am sure they were here—I counted them.
It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they do, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever.
“For the sake of fighting!”
“Let him give in his letter.”
The fact was that none of his servants, none of the travelers present, could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper.
The procureur, who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d’Épinay, well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife.
The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to insensibility.
God, who can read my heart, all the gratitude I feel, will reward you!
PORTHOS Chapter XXVI.
“Well, one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens, who began to march, some with the right foot, others with the left, I succeeded, I did, in making them all begin with the same foot, and I was made lieutenant on the spot.”
“And what was the end of the affair?”
“No, indeed,” replied Monte Cristo with a smile, “I do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing.”
“Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of January.
“Instantly!
“It is very evident what is the matter with her,” said Madame de Villefort; “M.
But to grieve my father—to disturb my grandmother’s last moments—never!”
At this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way, my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth, armed with sabres, pistols, and poniards—twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man, and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons, and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet.

This chancellor was a pleasant man.
“Alone?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Certainly.”
“That Monsieur d’Artagnan is a very brave man, mother,” said the young king.
“What do you say?”
Cucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had carried the maiden off.
“Ah,” said Beauchamp, “you doubt me?
“Did she return home?”
“Half-past one only?” said he.
“And he is a count?”
Our best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it.
“Yes,” repeated the leader in a whisper, “God bless his majesty!” and all these men, who had entered enraged, passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn.
“Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary man.”
if so, depend on it, you will be happy.”
“Behold Nebuchadnezzar!” exclaimed an old Puritan soldier, whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant.
“Hush!” said the captain; “it is a fire.”
In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was——”
“A complicated affair,” said Porthos; “where will you begin?”
Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old.
One would say you were carrying me off.”
Do you still fence well?”
Has anyone been speaking to you against me?”

D’Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner was fixed for midday D’Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment.
Albert then took a pen, and wrote:
Monte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there.

The mother and daughter passed the night together.
Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed, placing his pocketbook under his pillow.
“And I keep my word.
We saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to announce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugénie Danglars and M. Andrea Cavalcanti.
“Who wants me?”
We discovered yesterday the truth; what is the use of going to-day to learn something else?”
I tell you the queen does not love me; I tell you she loves another; I tell you she loves that infamous Buckingham!
“We are first,” said Morrel, looking out of the window.
“I once possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three ingredients of the happiness of angels, and now what am I?”
“Why?”
During the day I had nothing to fear.
“Quite; and now that I reflect about it, I am glad to leave Paris at this moment.”
“That’s the last folly to be committed,” said Athos, “seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy.”
“Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?”
“Well, and then?”
“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head.
You are now almost a man, since you have made your first passage of arms, and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me.”
He watched them pass through the crowd for some time, but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello.
Our host has a well-furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a ventilating hole.
“An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step.
Remain here?
“It is useless.
“Which—the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville?”
“How can I know that?”
Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to admit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away.
“Yes,” continued the cardinal.
You cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a vague and senseless noise.
Someone has vexed you; I will allow no one to annoy you.”
“Well!” said Albert.
Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de Tréville’s.”
On Saturday I will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph.”

But there is nothing which would do!—nothing!”
“Perhaps she has spoken to the _Pharaon_, and brings you some tidings of her?”
I wish every respect to be shown the count, although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen.”
Cocles remained in M. Morrel’s service, and a most singular change had taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant.
While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words, which at length fixed his attention.

The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night.
“It is my cousin!” cried the procurator’s wife.
The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother.
“Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it equally important.”
They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows.
I shall be happy to meet you again, sir.”
“_Tenacem propositi virum_.
The cardinal seemed furious.
“Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons.
“Valentine,” replied the young man, deeply affected, “I will not say you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no manner resembling what I feel for you.
“You are no longer a minister, my lord; you are a prisoner.”
Are you satisfied?”
Have you, then, madame, no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity, without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you?
Immediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants, each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand, went to attend upon the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome—a compliment to which his Majesty replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame upon the cardinal, who had detained him till eleven o’clock, talking of affairs of state.
There was a solemn, though momentary silence, which was broken by Aramis.
“So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with me, do I not?”
“As you left the choice of your costumes to me,” said the count to the two friends, “I have had these brought, as they will be the most worn this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the _confetti_ (sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.”
La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet, which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window.
Ah,” said the count, watching Andrea’s countenance, “I do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca.
“It appears,” she resumed, “that he sold it—-he sold it in order to save me another time—to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger—he sold it to Monsieur des Essarts, on whose finger I remarked it.
Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father, he worshiped him as a god.

“My friends, monsieur?” The queen shook her head.
The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to D’Artagnan a fine perspective, shining with quadruples and pistoles, and showed to Porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle; they were, in fact, asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed.
“From La Rochelle; and you?”

Porthos had not only been well received by the company, but he was moreover looked on with great admiration.
Do you preach them?”
and I’m one of the king’s musketeers.
Had old Æolus appeared at this moment, he would have been proclaimed king of the _moccoli_, and Aquilo the heir-presumptive to the throne.
Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera, doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you.”
“The nearest,” said the district doctor, “is a good Italian abbé, who lives next door to you.
“Well, it is impossible but that Master Aramis, that keen-scented bloodhound, and Athos, that wise and prudent nobleman, will discover our retreat.
The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.
ah!” said the prince, laughing, “I thought we should come to that.
“You are not Busoni?—you are not Monte Cristo?
The extreme beauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and purely Grecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely formed nose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race and country.
“My friends, that’s exactly like me!
“Good!
The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine.
“Nearly so.”
“I should like to understand,” said Porthos.
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair.
“Well, listen,” said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and putting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “I am vexed, too, for I do not love M. Franz d’Épinay.”
He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.
The Red Duke!” cried Porthos, clapping his hands and nodding his head.
“I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.”
“I know it, monsieur; everything is turned topsy-turvy in the world nowadays.”

“Your friend,
“Yes, indeed!” replied Debray.
“Yes,” said the Count, “you are right—it is miraculous.”
“Does he wear them?”
“What then?”
“The dead are everywhere,” said Morrel; “did you not yourself tell me so as we left Paris?”
The devil I am!
“_Permit_ you?

This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved, produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.
Everything in its proper time, and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently.
“Oh, you are beautiful—always beautiful!” cried Louise.
“One hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to your Majesty.”
“You disturb me?
As for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light.
Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter of Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen?
that would be too terrible!”
I am a criminal, as it appears.
“Yes.”
“Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again.”
It is true he had been playing the day before.”

But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead.
Speak, now the queen herself releases you from your promise.”
Are you also the victim of a treachery?”
And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer.
Milady shuddered through her whole system.
No, fifteen thousand are not enough,—I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs.”
“Do I know?” said he; “and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer?
“’Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur l’abbé is repeating to me.” said Athos in a loud voice, “and I confess I think it incomparable.”
At all events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy.
To this preoccupation of his vanity, D’Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish.
Dantès went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him.
Even on the night of the prince’s return, some citizens, bolder than the rest, such as the sheriffs, captains and the quartermaster, went from house to house among their friends, saying:
Ladies,’ said the officer, ‘do not disturb yourselves; allow me time just to kill this gentleman, and I will return and finish the last couplet.’

“I am coming, mademoiselle,” replied he.
“Affairs of importance which you shall know later.
Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air.
Bonacieux expected him.
The Earl of Essex, ’tis true, wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him by his royal mistress, whilst I—I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold, with a cipher on it and a date; but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the Palais Royal,* so they will never ruin me, as they long to do, and whilst they shout, ‘Down with Mazarin!’ I, unknown, and unperceived by them, incite them to cry out, ‘Long live the Duke de Beaufort’ one day; another, ‘Long live the Prince de Conde;’ and again, ‘Long live the parliament!’” And at this word the smile on the cardinal’s lips assumed an expression of hatred, of which his mild countenance seemed incapable.
At that voice, that mocking tone, and that familiar gesture, accenting voice and tone, Athos made a bound of surprise.
Porthos made a thousand flourishes, asking Bicarat what o’clock it could be, and offering him his compliments upon his brother’s having just obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing.
“No matter; I know it.” The count knit his brows, and remained silent an instant.
“The writing of Madame de Chevreuse!” said Milady to herself.

You know I have made the most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.”
“Come, sir.”
“Look, again, chevalier,” returned Lord Winter.
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
At this moment Winter’s voice was raised with the cry of “Forward!”
You alarm me.
If you do, I swear to you, for I have got to the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the wall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.”
He was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him.
“Yes,” said he, “yes, that would flatter me very much; but I should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction.

“A plague on’t!
He retired to his toilet.
“But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him.”

The manuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of Italy.
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria, “but too late, perhaps.”
“So that this strain of the knee,” continued D’Artagnan, “my dear Porthos, keeps you in bed?”
Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.
“I told you of it yesterday.
“And to think,” said Mousqueton, “that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer.
We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame.
Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!”

“Only one thing,” said the Italian.
Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only, and none of the banks would give him credit.

I swear before God, who seeth us, and who, in the darkness of this night heareth us, never shall my sword cross yours, never my eye express a glance of anger, nor my heart a throb of hatred, at you.

“And by whom are you forbidden?”
“Indeed!”
“And I know I shall drown before reaching it,” continued Blaisois.
“I see, my lord, I am to be taken back to the Bastile.”
“And moreover, very handsome saddles,” said Porthos, who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own.
“Zounds!” exclaimed Porthos, “’tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach.”
Oh, Queen!
“It is very hot,” said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, “and yet I cannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself.”
do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?”
“Still!” said the queen.
“Short or tall?”
Now that never happened to us when we were four together.
Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat behind.
‘Ah,’ said the captain, ‘we have still too much canvas set; all hands lower the mainsail!’ Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed under mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails.
“The sun is not shining,” said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier’s expression than by Valentine’s indisposition.

My English horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth.
The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted.
“I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window.
Maximilian smiled.
“Have you a letter of audience?” asked a porter, advancing to the new arrival.
“Speak.”
There are the acts signed; I deliver them to you without compulsion.
“Ah, yes, I understand,” said Mazarin; “want of fortune, perhaps.
“Stop a minute; you don’t know all yet.
“For what?”
As for myself, that I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”
“Three nights; and, by my troth, I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure.”
“Well, then,” with well acted good-humor, “I allow Grimaud, but no one else; you must manage it all.
“What do you mean?”
Franz coolly cocked both barrels.
Like all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced to perfection.
The party assembled, the room was lighted with waxlights, and the prisoner, with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room, had traced a long white line, representing a cord, on the floor.

Three days passed thus, during which his prayers were frequent, if not heartfelt.
As the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the Luxembourg.
“Do you hear how they sleep?” he asked.
“Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?”
“Oh, as for that, I’ll take you to a splendid place,” said the man with the handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him.
“A hundred francs.”
“And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people?” asked Gondy.
“What did I tell you?” said the governor.
D’Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past eight.
“Ay,” said Porthos, “if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may.”
“You will make tea for us, Baptistin,” said the count.
This was because his love, so strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant.
The house may be suspected; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d’Artagnan, for I can affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal.”
The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney.
“The count is very temperate.”
“Oh, my mother!” exclaimed Albert, so overcome he could scarcely speak; “it is not the same with you and me—you cannot have made the same resolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house, and—and to you.”
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them.
“True,” said Aramis; “but silence!
“Murder!” screamed Patrick.
“Yes, sir.”
Guard the prisoners well, I beg of you.”
It might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.
“Ah, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?” cried she; “and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen?”
“Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.” They shook hands.
“But who told you I was inactive?”
“Yes, madame,” replied the coadjutor; “I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom.”

The usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.
“Ah!
“See,” said he, “my dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes to their view.
“I once knew a Bragelonne—is he still alive?”
Well, over that coach-house are the servants’ rooms, with bells corresponding with the different apartments.”
“Well, comte, I am going instantly,” interrupted the duchess, “to send for the Prince de Marsillac, who is happily, in Paris just now.
“_Diable!_” he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve.
“Courage!” he whispered to Porthos, as they proceeded.
why, it is after one o’clock.”
“No.
The soldiers, who knew only their orders, attempted to force him along.
“Sit down, dear friend, to table.
“Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak, nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.
At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, D’Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter.
“You spoke of a mission.”
The three friends ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed.
You who never interest yourself in politics?”
‘Why does the boat go so fast?’ asked I of my mother.
What brings you to Paris?”
Go on Aramis, go on.”
“Wounded!” said Athos; “it was a phenomenon of skill.”
“Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a dressing-room.
When I look at this room,—whence so many guilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look at that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,—oh, it requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge.”
“Oh, I also swear it!”
“Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count.
D’Artagnan bent down to his horse’s neck, the young man fired, and the ball severed the feathers from the hat.

Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition.
“Give him to me.
“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——”
“We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke.
Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken.
“So!” thought D’Artagnan, and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived.
“Monseigneur,” said he, “my life is yours; henceforth dispose of it.

“What do you mean, monsieur?”
The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet high; an interior partition separated the two families, and each apartment had its entrance door.
The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police invented mousetraps.
You may join me at the Hôtel des Gardes.
“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to repress an exclamation.
“The Standard.”
Then, without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention, he asked for his telescope.
“Does he talk?”
The young men, impatient to learn the cause of the firing, spurred on toward the servants.
And he threw the money into the river.
These two men were the executioner’s assistants.
At the sight of Carlini, Cucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand.
Having obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps.

“Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets.”
“Well, then, listen.

The host, who saw two young noblemen, richly clad, promised everything they required, and our two cavaliers, after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun, started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Greney.
By denying all, it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he might prove his good will.
Imposing silence, Grimaud put out the little night lamp, then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant’s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith.
Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does not talk much)—Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded as he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door afresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar.”
Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other, and was about to cut up the fowl.
“If I sought your ruin, fool, I should drag you to the first guard-house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability you will have no more to fear.
If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d’Artagnan and his friends, he will bring them to us.”
One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: “If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.”
No, listen to me; I have the true idea.”
“I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are, but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections.”
“You are very kind.”
Now one of two things must happen: either matters will not be arranged, or they will be arranged, in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again.”
“Sterlets,” said Château-Renaud, “are only found in the Volga.”
“But let it be done explicitly and positively.
“Only I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast, thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained forty-eight hours without eating or drinking.
But you are dripping, my dear fellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.
The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed.
Behold, madame!
13,” murmured he, growing still paler.
The cab crossed the Pont-Neuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the driver was paid as the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.
“Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.”
D’Artagnan, meantime, went into the house, whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went away.
“Now,” said Aramis, “you will please to understand, gentlemen, that Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours.
“The three last,” returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected, for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.
“What man is that?
Porthos turned aside, in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind.
I am M. Mordaunt.”
Porthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme.
Handle the musket and the sword, my dear fellow.
At eight o’clock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber.
Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.
“Will you name him?”
“The more so, sir, as it was men’s and not God’s doing.”
“I tell you what I have been told.”
“Mercédès is dead, madame,” said Monte Cristo; “I know no one now of that name.”
“Shall I see you again soon?”
The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king.
With this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties.
“To reflect?” said Morcerf, more and more astonished; “have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?”
He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping.
“Yes,” he said, “there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall.
“Did he tell you so?”
“But I,” said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke—“I am gallant enough to offer it you.”
“Which cannot last,” interrupted Comminges; “the cardinal said so; there is no prison here.”
The repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited at table.
Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played, drank, sang, but that whilst playing, drinking, singing, he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at Vincennes.
“Have you seen my mother?” asked Albert.
“Oh, doctor!”
“Speak!
“No; I know my place and am not so presumptuous.
“Oh,” murmured the count, “shall I then be permitted to love again?
He denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well.”
“Hush!
“That makes in all?” said Athos.
Bonacieux.
Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance, brucine——”
“You rely on the usurper’s return?”
I’m your man.”
“But what then must be done?” asked Morrel.
At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has once been done may be done again.
M. de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.
How absurd—as if one crown were not as good as another.
On the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.
Morcerf had expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he who, under the count’s guidance, followed a course of archæology, mineralogy, and natural history.
Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age.
Dantès, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was for every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack, extricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still lower.
“It is there,” said Felton, touching the bag of money with his foot.
“I shall entertain, whatever may happen,” said D’Artagnan, placing his hand upon his breast and bowing, “an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for me.”
There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me.
None of this had escaped the count, and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer.
“Do not be alarmed, M. Noirtier,” said d’Avrigny; “I am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness.”

The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated.
Chapter 78.
If so, speak out,” answered Athos.
“Well, my dear,” replied Athos, “you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy.”
The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color once or twice.
Nevertheless, if the affairs of our family are arranged, as we hope they will be, I believe she will run the risk of being damned, and will return to those she regrets, particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her.
Porthos!” he exclaimed.
“We want,” said Athos, “Charlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la Fère, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.”
“Is it possible,” said he, “that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?”
The minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he stammered out:
“Are you ill?”
“Well, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent fellow.
“What is he doing?”
I, in my quality of journalist, open all the theatres to him.”
75.”
In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house, and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds.
Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door.
A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned nobody.
“_Pardieu_, monsieur!” said Athos, “that’s a proposition that pleases me; not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the gentleman.
It was nine o’clock in the evening; the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour.
From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number, paraded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything.
“It seems to me,” said Emmanuel, “that I see two young men down there, who are evidently, waiting.”
When crime has been committed, and God, doubtless in anger, turns away his face, it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice.”
I obeyed my love; and have I not been richly paid for that obedience?
“I?” said Monte Cristo; “my dear viscount, how have you discovered that I did not like M. Franz!
“Gives me pain, but will not prevent my walking.”
The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.
“But why has he waited till now?
It was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt to let themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net.
Not on the same night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrière d’Enfer, taking the road to Orléans.
“But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal?
The article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a universal shudder pervaded the assembly, and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks.
“My friend,” said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, “that is what I wish.
Now as you are one of the whole world, I mean to say that you also are deserting me.”
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care.
“‘The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M. de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him.
I am, temporarily, commander of the _Pharaon_, with the certainty of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue.
The steward entered.
As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him.
“D’Artagnan.”
Then, turning to his desk, he said, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:
Whitehall.
“Oh, very easily.
I am determined to tell them all about it.”
“But so it is.”
“’Tis well; arise, vicomte, embrace me.”
We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground, bathed in a pool of blood.

The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him about a hundred paces behind.
“It is a young girl.”
“This must be impossible!”
Alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but was nothing but simple buff behind.
“And what took place?”
They thought he slipped, as at first, and the witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to raise him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood.
Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed, he related his adventure.
“Ah!” muttered Athos, “I may be mistaken, I haven’t the unerring eye of D’Artagnan.”
“Then do not marry her,” said the count.
Patrick went out.
D’Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.
One thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.
“Mother, we have no more money.”
“Really?”
God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when he at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds, and led him to you!”
“What, then, is this Monsieur Scarron, who thus puts all Paris in commotion?
Meanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician.
Chapter LXVII.
When he came up again the light had disappeared.
“Then you pity him?” said the count.
“That’s right,” said Athos; “put your other hand here.” And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support, so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt; and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers.
In the meantime D’Artagnan was defiling with his company.
“Judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,” replied Athos.
“We expect it.”
Her first movement was repellent.

“Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family, perhaps, one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one.
“You speak as if you were already her husband.”
D’Artagnan will give each of us his instructions.
“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.
the devil take this gout!”
“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse.
“Oh, I am free—then I am saved!”
Do you love me still?”
The Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition, pressed D’Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand compliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthos’s adversary was already installed in the carriage, and as Aramis’s had taken to his heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.
Franz and Albert were like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow, have recourse to wine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated, feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present.
“Gentlemen,” exclaimed D’Artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned, “gentlemen, think of what you are about.
“No; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more pressing than the first.
“But,” said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, “we shall leave our skins there.”
“Oh, no,” answered Franz, “I had no such intention; and even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so from Monte Pincio; could I not?”
were I but a Frenchman!
“What she?” asked Athos.
I have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never been able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?”
And both extended their hands as if to seize the king, but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers, both had fallen, one dead, the other stunned.
“I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that letter must have led to your condemnation.”
Speak!’ Morcerf did not reply.
Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile.
Flee alone!”
There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of _La Jeune Amélie_.
“Your Milady,” said he, “appears to be an infamous creature, but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her.
Chapter 100.
Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips; she had to deal with a Gascon who played close.
“And now, where is he gone?” inquired D’Artagnan.
The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.
“You demanded a favor?” said the baron, suspiciously.
“But I think it would be still better,” said Aramis, “to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same time.”
“Yes, my captain.”
As for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character—a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be able to follow in its development—his lackey was called Bazin.
Excuse me.”

Valentine, with her woman’s instinct, guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristo’s second, and from the young man’s well-known courage and his great affection for the count, she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him.
The poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears.

The carriage, however, passed on.
Madame de Villefort started.
The thirty-two that we shall use tonight are its progeny; they are all entirely black, with the exception of a star upon the forehead.”
“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.
For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the world.”
“Help!
Aramis parted from Athos, went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel, whistling the air of a song in praise of Cromwell.
“Ah!
Try, therefore, either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here.
“When I see her majesty embarrassed, I shall conduct her to Rueil, make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box.”
Porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton.
“Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour’s conversation I have had with you, which is indeed impossible.”
“He fancies he possesses an immense treasure.
“So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, everyone here is as well-informed as yourself.”
“Allies!” said the queen, shaking her head.
It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just set sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.
Then who reigns in France at this moment—Napoleon II.
“You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was about to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me.
While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.
“Yes; I am calculating—by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns you—I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made 300,000 livres.”
“Thanks, my captain!” replied D’Artagnan, who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out that he was betraying me.”
“Ah, in such a case one supposes——”
_Pardieu_, Beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!”
When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his dripping hand from the font.
Athos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched Milady’s forehead, and then, in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution, “Madame,” said he, “you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed; or upon my soul, I will blow your brains out.”
Edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was said.
Happily Marie and a follower of hers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men’s clothes.
If she flies, kill her; but don’t exceed your orders.”
Reflect how glorious a day it will be, how grand, how solemn, that day of complete restoration, on which you will say in this very office, ‘My father died because he could not do what I have this day done; but he died calmly and peaceably, because in dying he knew what I should do.’”
You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two words, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.”
“The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we going there for?”
“The people are hurrying on, the soldiers under arms, and among the spectators I see D’Artagnan.
“What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain.
He then repaired to D’Artagnan, who, thanks to his four trusses of straw, was in the act of making up and tasting, by anticipation, the luxury of a bed so soft, so well stuffed at the head, so well covered at the foot, that it would have excited the envy of the king himself, if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own.
“Good!”
“It is from your father.”
“Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.”
They both set off to the other end of the camp, but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for.

“Suppose I happen to strangle him?”
“Go away,” he said; “your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence.
The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the Champs-Élysées, and made Monte Cristo raise his head.
and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...
“And I,” said Aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, “remember that I will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage.”
“You live badly on your thousand francs?”
“’Tis true,” he said; “but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out, a gimlet to pierce the cask?”
“Not so,” murmured the journalist; “on the contrary——”
“Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there.”
“And what did the doctor answer?” asked Monte Cristo.
“What could be the good of that?
“As for me,” said Porthos, “now that you have reminded me of it, Athos, I have the scene again before me, as if I now were there.
“Listen!” said Dantès.
This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it; but on reflection he hated him more and more, being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct.
Athos went close to it, and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.
Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made?
“From a certain Abbé Busoni.”
Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette.
“Look!” said the boy, “there’s our beadle, who is going a journey.”
“Morrel——”
“Why, you killed him!
Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair.
As we have said, he was lying on the deck.
Supper was served.
No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious.”
“Exactly.”
What am I?—the law.
At about a league and a half from the city, D’Artagnan, finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon, stopped to give the horses breathing time.
Let us to bed!”
Once in Paris, I shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman!”
Degenerate world!”
Three brigands, called Trestaillon, Truphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism.
“God,” he murmured, not knowing what he said,—“God—God!” Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of God.
He approached, paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.
“He will; rely upon it.
D’Artagnan only sighed.
The general remark is, ‘Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters.

“On the contrary,” replied Aramis, “your opinion will be very valuable.
“Not the least in the world.”
“But your mission will not be accomplished.”
In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and so preparing himself for his future destiny.
I heard you cry out, without understanding what you said.
This advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip.
“I depend upon your word.”
“And there again you are wrong.
“But you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have me tortured, you are able to have me hanged; you are the master, and I could not have the least word to say.
now we may say at last, thank Heaven!
I wish to consult you about some thing.”
“At what hour?”
The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing, on foot, his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat.
“Planchet, sir.”
The house, which was discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage-contract was going on.
“I believe so.” The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort relieved all Dantès’ apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed himself in the centre of the escort.
Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friend’s conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the count’s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess.
“No, indeed, sir,” answered Raoul.
IN WHICH M. SÉGUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE BELL
Good!
good heavens, madame,” said the count, “are you ill, or is it the heat of the room that affects you?”
His face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat.
“For what reason?”
courage!”
On the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring let into a square flag-stone.
Monsieur d’Artagnan!” said Mazarin, “you are worth your weight in gold.”
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.
“Yes, much,” said D’Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer.
“Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel,” said the count, “that is what I intended.”
They mounted again at once, whilst looks of admiration passed between them.
“Ah,” said Louise, breathing freely, “here we are out of Paris.”
You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them, and they reply to you.”
At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.
For the emperor’s return?—the emperor is no longer on the throne, then?”
“Not yet, I think.
Aramis stopped.
“Come in, come in,” said Morrel, “for I presume you are all at the door.”
“If they should hear of the separation——”
no.
“You know her, it seems?” said Château-Renaud.
“Come,” thought Franz, “he is still more mysterious, since the two accounts do not agree.”
“And you, Monsieur D’Artagnan, what do you want?”
Still he had not even uttered a sigh.
d’Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme.
At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.
Danglars smiled, and seemed to say, “It is of no consequence.” Then, hoping doubtless to effect his purpose, he said,—“The prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday.
And why, when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed, might he not also be?
His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.
“I don’t want anybody else to talk to me.
“Gentlemen,” he said, when he was in his room, “you do not expect, I presume, to keep me here a long time incognito?”
They had observed for some time before them, on the horizon, a rather thick wood; and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it, Monsieur d’Arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count’s two grooms.
The cell was clean, though empty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth.
“That is precisely the fault of the age.”
First, here is the letter.
“_Parbleu!_” said the young man; “was it possible there could be two answers to such a question?”
Mademoiselle Danglars was still the same—cold, beautiful, and satirical.
Gloves of gray kid, matching the hat, well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand; whilst his boots, similar in color to the hat and gloves, confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old.
It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity.
“Leave me—go!”
“How unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,” said Franz; “here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments.”
I lost a battle in Spain, I have been defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.”
Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he placed his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her for a long time against his bosom.
‘Go into the grotto and dress yourself.’
“Thank you.
That is not all; the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor; I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me.
“With grandpapa Noirtier.”
Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today?”
“Indeed, sir,” said Andrea, “I assure you I have never given the subject a thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two millions.”
The nobleman to whom he applied, being a friend of Porthos, was very ready, not to sell them, as was proposed, but to lend them.
Chapter 20.
D’Artagnan continued: “Before God and before men, I accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from Villeroy, with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends.
“Oh, all this is a family history, as Château-Renaud told you the other day,” observed Maximilian.

“By whom?”

The next moment D’Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame.
Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord Wilmore’s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum,—a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine.
The queen made a sign for every one, except Mazarin, to quit the room; and Gondy bowed, as if to leave with the rest.
“But I do not think so.”
You arrive, and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company; yet I expect, in all probability, to quit the convent at any moment.”
When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be silent, and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced towards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps.
At ten o’clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the king’s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that body, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel.
“Yanina?”
“Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush?
“Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him.”
“You are not called ‘Lionne’ for nothing,” observed Madame de Chevreuse, “your teeth are terrible.”
At nine o’clock the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage.
“Less love than politics,” replied D’Artagnan, with a reflective air; “and what do you suspect?”
As for Grimaud, his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow.
“‘“I am a royalist,” replied the general; “I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.” These words were followed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness.
Good-bye, count.”
“No pity for him who had no pity!
At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door.
He would have spoken, but his voice failed him.
“That will not prevent me,” replied D’Artagnan, “if ever I find him.”
“Yes, madame,” replied the officer.
“Why do you ask me that?” replied the stranger, with a coolness which was barely civil.
“We have heard all it was necessary we should hear; besides, I don’t prevent you from listening, but I must be gone.”
Porthos followed him by the same road, but with more difficulty and less diligence.
Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he read the following:
The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe.
To a look of interrogation which they made, Milady replied by a sign that it was he.
We say corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof.
“What are you doing, reverend sir?
“Come, now, what are your conditions?”
D’Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a postillion rode before them.
“Well,” said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which he could not understand, and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian, “let it begin again,—it is like the house of the Atreidae;19 God has condemned them, and they must submit to their punishment.

“Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?” asked M. Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse.
As we have before said, the post-chaise was waiting; four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali, apparently just arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of the steps, his face bathed in perspiration.
She prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking,—for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,—after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque, which he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere.
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you had a triumphant idea!
Is it because my opinions differ from yours?”
THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS
I heard the noise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in loading his musketoon.
As to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself with interrogating D’Artagnan by a look.
“Oh, that’s simple enough!” replied Athos.
The second visit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready.
“Did he give you any details?”
They traversed the width of the village, talking of indifferent things, then as they reached the last houses:
It is quite regular and explicit,” said the governor.
While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants.
I have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public, you say, is that they proceed from me, an unhappy foreigner, who has been unable to please the French.
“What can you expect, Athos?
“I have the honor to inform your Majesty,” continued M. de Tréville, in the same tone, “that a party of _procureurs_, commissaries, and men of the police—very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears, against the uniform—have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l’Evêque, all upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur Athos.”
“And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?”
He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field.
At nine o’clock Madame la Première Présidente arrived.
“Above us all, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s response, in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered.
Emmanuel tried to comfort the women, but his eloquence faltered.
After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district, which was given him.
“It is I—Mousqueton,” said a mournful voice, whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road.
“Give it to me.”
Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl, and Chambertin wine instead of Macon.
“In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o’clock in the afternoon.
It is the password.
That evening he had a long conference with several friends; and M. Cavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was the last to leave the banker’s house.
“This evening, sir,” he replied, “all will be ready.”
think what a solemn engagement you are making; one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper, the other a count; you are going, then, to offer a prince, are you?”
Three or four times he started up, imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him.
It was already too late.
“Any noise in the ears?”
“Indeed, no,” said Château-Renaud.”
“And where did you get so much money?” said Athos.
I am dying!

The sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step; and just below this lamp there was laid, wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet, worked with fleurs-de-lis of gold, a catafalque resting on trestles of oak.
He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners, since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time; and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that disappearance.
Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude mingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked.
“Then she looks upon you as a stranger?”
“Mr.
“In the king’s service?”
At the first sight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled himself in his easy-chair.
The second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Tréville, and that of M. de la Trémouille, commanded a little reflection.
“Now,” said he, “the sacrifice is consummated!
The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came Franz.
“Richelieu,” thought D’Artagnan, “would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance.”
“Why you, my lord, might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward; and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from us.”
Well, I would secure for myself a fortune independent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him.” Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her efforts.
This recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph.
Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes.
“In that case I should beat a retreat.
“In a moment the valet-de-chambre will call the guard, as he did yesterday and the day before.”
The executioner, who had lifted himself up, fell back upon his bed.
“Yes; a certain D’Artagnan, a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in company with three of his friends, with the intention of going to London.”
“Madame,” said D’Artagnan, “the people want to see the king and they must see him.”
You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that, ever since I have known this man, I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him.
Their return was quite an event, but as they entered together, all uneasiness on Albert’s account ceased instantly.
“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.
He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another, and he never would.
Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.”
“In the cellar, monsieur.”
Her first trial was lost; she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources.
“Albert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since, and whom I killed to get rid of, I should not have taken this trouble; but I thought this mark of consideration due to you.
“Gentlemen,” said the count, springing out, “when you are tired of being actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene, you know you have places at my windows.
We were speaking of a suitable habitation for the Count of Monte Cristo.
“Oh!” said Caderousse, groaning with pain.
“‘He was a foreigner?’
“Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty-five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more.”
You never come to me without conferring pleasure.
I require honorable guaranties.”
“Thin and lanky.”
On two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her, that she has succumbed.
The executioner opened his eyes, turned toward the young man and grasped his arm.
Valentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear, exclaimed:
“Say on.”
They will know you are deserted, and think you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”
Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.”
The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist, presented themselves at the starting-post.
Aramis, on the contrary, struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement.
He is a worthy, honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody.
Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic—explain yourself.”
What say you?”
“He wore a mask.”
Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme.
D’Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her.
“At these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto, lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume.
Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot, urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie, which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip.
“Because,” said Debray, “Albert sent this morning to request us to come.” Beauchamp and Château-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment.
At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head.
“What!
yes, indeed!” cried D’Artagnan, who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him; “yes, surely, he said——”
“Have pity on Valentine!
The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two men presented themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who, smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid by a mere look from Monte Cristo.
“Now there remains the chevalier, or the Abbé d’Herblay, as your majesty pleases.”
Egad!
“’Tis a very strong post,” he resumed, “and we have forty good men, tried soldiers, having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fronde.”
To love you cry, ‘Fie!
“I am taken!” shouted Athos, with all the power of his lungs.
Really, that Demoiselle d’Aubigne is very charming!”
“Oh, I remember!” said Mme.
Aramis found Athos and brought him.
“Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?”
“Come, come, dear Athos, confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this affair.”
“Whichever of the three you like, I have no preference.”
“Perhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife’s relations with Madame de Chevreuse.”
“What!
“And what part did he play in this sad drama?” inquired the abbé.
“Well, then, I don’t know.”
Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the carriage, muttered a short prayer.
The fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length D’Artagnan dropped his sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.
“‘That is very annoying,’ said the brigadier; for the man we are looking for is the chief.’
Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos, which the besieged himself demolished.
This time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious.
“You always say _trifles_, my dear Athos!” said D’Artagnan, “and that comes very ill from you, who have never loved.”
“You may well say, perchance,” replied the banker; “for he comes so seldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.”
The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door.
All these cloaks, gray or black, were raised behind by the point of a sword, or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket.
“I cannot take you, however, to the siege of La Rochelle,” said D’Artagnan.
What a confounded country this England is!
“Yes.”
“Good Lord!” said D’Artagnan, who, as we have often said, never stumbled at anything.
The pupils of his eyes, as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.
Have you killed the cardinal?
She drew her husband to the door.
That night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks, the patrols of armed shop-people, and the bands of mendicants reappeared.
never!
“Yes, monsieur.”
“It is frightful,” murmured Mazarin.
“My God, I thank Thee that he knows me only.”
It will be well to prepare a light supper, of which you, Athos and Aramis, are not to partake—Athos, because I told him you had a fever; Aramis, because you are a knight of Malta and won’t mix with fellows like us.
“Undoubtedly.”
While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw nothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the better examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his finger in, tasted it.
The two Guardsmen courteously accepted D’Artagnan’s excuses, and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.
“Let us dine, then,” said Porthos; “it is getting cold.”
It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you!
“Yes, by a blow of your fist, if you can; we will not fire but at the last extremity.”
“No.
this,” cried the voice, the tone of which was at once polished and jeering, “this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men.
And they darted on anew.
30293m
Milady was dressing herself all the time.
“Eugénie!
“Hold, hold, hold!” said Athos, wit his quiet tone; “that throw of the dice is extraordinary.
* It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not taken such vows as to prevent it, was secretly married to Anne of Austria.—La Porte’s Memoirs.
“What!” said Kitty, blushing.
THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE
“Yes, yes, when the campaign is over,” replied the Gascon.
The _Agamemnon_ of Aeschylus is based on this legend.
“Can he give me any particulars?”
“Yes, I know what you mean,” he said; “you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months, and from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.”
“Come!” exclaimed Aramis.
“I remember now; yes, it was about—stop a minute—yes, it was about a woman.”
“‘Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.’
If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further, we shall find her, or rather, she will find us tomorrow; then she will give me some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.”
“Sir,” said Planchet, in a mournful tone, “do you abandon me thus to my fate?
She was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel’s voice, when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor.
“Let us leave them,” she said.
You are the son of my aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from Noyon, in Picardy; you have several lawsuits and no attorney.
“By my honor, these Gascons are incorrigible!
Besides, I believe, between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart.
The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans, the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbé de la Riviere; and the third, the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti, brother and brother-in-law of Condé.
“Be so kind as to reflect, sire,” said the cardinal.
The count bit his lips till the blood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding, however, that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned from the door, towards which he had been directing his steps, and again confronted the banker.
A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures.
At this moment one of his penitents passed, and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile.
That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success.
“Not on your own account, surely,” replied Monte Cristo; “for a man is above that sort of thing?”
The man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite terms.
“No; I only know that some time after Edmond’s arrest, he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars, as high in station as Fernand.
Meanwhile, the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king’s room, attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men, had stolen little by little toward the table, and standing on tiptoe, lounged, watching the game, over the shoulders of D’Artagnan and Porthos.
Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan.
One of them, hat in hand, said to him:
“And now,” replied D’Artagnan, “behold the sad spectacle that awaits us.
He awoke.
“My dear friends,” said D’Artagnan, “give your swords to Monsieur Mouston, who will return them to you at the proper time and place, and do not forget you are our prisoners.”
“Aha,” said Groslow; “on account of political opinions?
There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going.
Debray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against the edge of the door, like Nathan in _Athalie_.
One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak.
He vaulted hastily from his horse, whilst Planchet, with a smile on his lips, advanced toward the master of the house.
Porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine.
“Very good,” said the major, “I do not demand more, you understand——”
“Ask her,” said Morrel, translating Noirtier’s thought this time by his look.
Monte Cristo seemed in despair.
“How so, general?”
Debray conveyed the count’s reply to the baroness.
This precipitation—this unusual appointment.
“Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “I allow of no excuse.
“But at least, if you don’t want to see me turn crazy, tell what that famous pate will contain.”
After mass the young monarch drove to the Parliament House, where, upon the throne, he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each one, according to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others—a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president, Molé—whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.
himself, who took a pride in being considered a past master therein.
“Was this woman English?”
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.
Athos turned around with an effort; the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him, and there he still was, in fact, on the rock, the beacon shedding around him, as it were, a doubtful aureole.
Now, nothing of the kind has happened.”
Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple lips.
“What!
“My lord, I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges, the ten men you demand.
“He resides in a quiet quarter,” continued Aramis; “his tastes and his profession require it.
And even if she were to be seriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has treated her with a severity—”
“My name is Edmond Dantès,” replied the young man calmly; “I am mate of the _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.”
Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.
“And thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers.”
“Who said it was a crime?” asked Villefort, with a last effort.
“A proof of great humility or great pride,” said Monte Cristo.
People are found every day in the Seine, having thrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim.”
Porthos, impatient at his continued losses, kept up a vigorous play with his knee.
At each corner were arranged trophies, presenting to view swords of all sorts, and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the Cardinal de la Valette, and the Archbishop of Bordeaux.
“Tell me what it is,” replied Monte Cristo.
Let us save them half of their journey.”
“No, I can trust nobody.”
But as regards the letter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself.
“Blaisois,” replied Mousqueton, “remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman, who is not always able to get bread, ask Grimaud.”
Monsieur de Chavigny, turning toward the door, used to call out: “Halloo!
On the contrary, that simplifies the matter greatly.
I should like you a hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain a bachelor, even were it only for ten years.”
“Listen.
“And yet they were the same,” murmured Monte Cristo, “only now it is broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun which brightens the place, and makes it appear so cheerful.”
“I would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!”
The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille, where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets.
“Madame de Chevreuse was not queen,” murmured Anne of Austria, overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion.
After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into which the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.
Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword.
“I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling——”
“I traveled in England when I was young, I speak English like an Englishman, and Aramis, too, knows something of the language.
At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the carriage.
This feeling lasted but for a moment.
“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have been the case.
Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o’clock in the morning to take a third letter.
“Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an instant’s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.”
“Oh, as to that, Monseigneur, it is true,” said Athos; “we do conspire, as your Eminence might have seen the other morning.
His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to England.
Fighting here, are you?
“Come hither?”
“Madame, I do not ask you to tell me,” said Mazarin, astounded by this returning courage.
“Yes, I understand.”
I will teach you how to laugh to-morrow—but in another manner.”
“Yes,” said Harrison, laughing, and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table.
“Oh, do not confound the two, Eugénie.”
“So, then, they drew up the indictments before the king was taken?”
He entered Portsmouth about eight o’clock in the morning.
His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.
Morrel caught his hand.
“And be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd, notwithstanding his seventy-six years.”
He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later Louis XIV.
“Help!
Look at Monsieur du Vallon, that faithful soul, that arm of steel, who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage.
“You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your compatriots.”
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy.
D’Artagnan thought of all these matters.
“Yes,” continued Morrel, “death had entered that house twice within one month.”
They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men; whereas four men together make a troop.
“In the hour of rest, between noon and one o’clock——”
“I’faith!” said D’Artagnan to Raoul, “you were just in time to stay my hand.
D’Artagnan ran out and returned directly after.
“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?”
“Good, my child.
These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted; opened the door, entered and shut it after them.
“You know the best harbors?”
to lift their hands against a minister of God.”
“Oh, no,” replied Aramis, “I should much prefer Blaisois; we haven’t known him so long.”

“Why, when all was arranged?”
I told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those, in houses that had no signs; but she always laughed at me.
“Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by the proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucern.
“Well,” said the doctor, after a moment’s silence, “I will wait.”
“But the carriage and horses?” said Franz.
“Yes, my child.”
“Shall I write your deposition?
One of your ancestors had joined the Crusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you mount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.”
Instead of performing your part of this contract, as I performed mine, you bought me from the Scotch, cheaply, I know, and that does honor to the economic talent of your government.
“Thank you, sir; it will be well employed, I hope.”
Porthos looked very melancholy.
“Plague stifle you and your Latin!” said D’Artagnan, who began to feel all his patience exhausted.
_Edmond Dantès:_
“All remains the same, then, in that quarter?”
Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am convinced they would have left us in peace.”
Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab; Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haydée, my slave, thinks me a Greek.
“Help me, gentlemen,” cried D’Artagnan, “we must break in this door.”

M. Noirtier de Villefort
De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy.
They mounted—the king on Winter’s horse and Winter on that of the king; then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron, and the king, with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left, at the head of the second.
“I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a philosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king’s attorney, died of grief or anger at finding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been _enceinte_ six.
“What do you wish me to do?”
“I tell you to hope.
“Here,” replied the gendarmes.
“You followed him?” cried Athos.
“Probably not.”
“Yes, yes!
“Stop!” he said, “there he is at his post.”
They know that I am intimate with you—that you are, in fact; one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintances—and they will not find you at my house; they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you.
want one!” cried the Gascon.
In truth, my dear Captain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey.
I know not where I have left my hat, and in all probability I should have been left with my hat, had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me.”
“Yes, yes,” said the young man, “yes;” and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure, he said, “Be it so, my father.”
“Oh,” said the count, “I only know two things which destroy the appetite,—grief—and as I am happy to see you very cheerful, it is not that—and love.
“What is it?” said Albert; “arranging your papers, apparently.”
Hunger made viands once repugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread.
“Confound it, yes!” replied Danglars.
“How?”
“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.
The queen appeared, and was followed by the king and the Duke d’Anjou, his brother.
“Oh, no.
They were in earnest conversation.
“We must first extract the steel from the side,” said he, shaking his head in a significant manner.
“Full dress?” said the major, half aloud.
“It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best.
D’Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess, who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover, though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand.
“What, then!
“Oh, sir, what are you proposing?”
“Why, that I should think it very amusing,” replied Franz, “if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert.”
“Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?
“Oh, you know him well, my lord—it is Count de Rochefort.”
“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort.
Noirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble, while, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.
“To-morrow morning.”
“Conclude, then, sir,” answered De Chatillon, with as much hauteur as Aramis.
The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing-room.
Suddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice behind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”
“Dec.
“Did I say ‘dead or alive?’” replied Mazarin.
I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea.
Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall, and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him.
I reached the lower door.
“This very night.”
At the noise made by D’Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head, and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man, the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world.
Mordaunt, completely deceived by the wordy civility of D’Artagnan, smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him, and said:
The strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men’s minds, so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld.
Porthos!
The maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out a little billet to him said, “For your master.”
“They may not be so very great.”
Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused?’ The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges.
“It was about four o’clock in the afternoon, and although the day was brilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern.
He knows her brother-in-law.
“That’s impossible,” said the gentleman; “I have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.”
Athos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:
As for Andrea, he was launched, and when he was once launched nothing stopped him.
“Well, have you any news?” Athos asked.
“And what method of surveillance do you employ?”
Do not fly, then.
“I will not fail.”
Monte Cristo called the owner, who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare.
“What a bad calculator you are!” exclaimed Danglars, calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation.
Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince.”
The table and chair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been removed.
Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.
“Shall I row you ashore?”
When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which she kept the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak.
“No.”
Upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it was Porthos, and not D’Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him back to the hôtel, mounted his horse, and disappeared.”
“Alas!”
Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes.
“Ah, I recollect,” replied the count; “did you not say something of an infant?”
“Your majesty wishes, then——”
They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach.
To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them coolly—such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and anxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!”
“This is terrible,” said Athos.
I know all these things.
Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time.
“To which of us?” asked all the four friends.
Alas!
“And those of the first floor?”
“Oh, when I said I was alone,” said Milady, hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself, “it is not for want of friends in high places; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal.
“I’ve broken my man’s skull,” cried D’Artagnan.
“Go out this way,” said she, opening a small private door, “and come back at eleven o’clock; we will then terminate this conversation.
About what time?”
Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all D’Artagnan wished.
“What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?”
You might excite a little curiosity, but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark.”
“Which,” asked he, “the viscount or the count?”
This time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only utter a groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.
“In fact,” said Mordaunt, with a calm voice and immovable countenance, “a single blow sufficed.”
If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,—besides, I may not be there myself.”
Mousqueton remained glued to the door, awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence.
“Yes.”
“Ah, I understand you,” said the unhappy man.
We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island.
My vocation commands me; it carries me away.”
A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly.
Yes, madame.
The gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence.
“My friend,” exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.
Perform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere.
It will suffice, then, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many fruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at length found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not recollect which, having for title, “Memoirs of the Comte de la Fère, Touching Some Events Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign of King Louis XIII.
How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?”
Bonacieux; I say that I have reflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly to the cardinal.”
Do not lose time, Comminges,” he continued; “get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up; be quick, or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed.
“Listen,” said he; “I have not the strength of mind you have, or rather that which you would not have, if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned.” The doctor turned pale.
Condé himself, whilst fighting for him, lost no opportunity of ridiculing, of humbling him.
The morning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of night, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the inn.
Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted, but offered me three months.
“Well, then, let us say no more about it,” said D’Artagnan; “and let us burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh infidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid.”
“Monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,” said D’Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions.
“Bring in the Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary to the guards.
“Ah, true,” cried Blaisois, with evident admiration; “but it will be dark in the cellar.”
“My lord,” said Comminges, “I answered that to compose a Ligue only one ingredient was wanting—in my opinion an essential one—a Duc de Guise; moreover, no generation ever does the same thing twice.”
This was Julie, who had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault.
His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed, they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull, which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole.
“And you, D’Artagnan?”
The count then hastened to us, and took us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life.
You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances.”
S’blood!
Only one minute, Mr. Felton, and you will have saved my honor!”
I am sure you would not have forced me to come.
“And supposing you had succeeded?”
“But, also,” said Mazarin, “you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful.”
“I had no intention of fighting to-day, sir; I was charged, indeed, with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil, when, seeing Monsieur de Chatillon charge, an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side.
The next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early; he had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at all.
Nature has made us thus; she makes the young look ever forward, not behind.
“You said that Porthos had received a sword cut.”
“Groslow!” said Aramis; “the devil!
If you want anything you can ring.”
“Come along,” he said; and he went toward the door of the second compartment.
“Well,” said Château-Renaud, “I was not wrong just now then, when I said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters.
Grimaud immediately obeyed.
D’Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and all ran out, in order to repair to their posts.

“A minute.
But this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.
Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation.
Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parry’s brother, he was not nearly so strong as himself.

THE JOURNEY
Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand?
He brought me up as if I had been his son, and in 1814 he married.
“Men who bear my robe have no age,” replied the monk, dryly.
To fight, that was to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself.
Charles shuddered.
We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday, and the two will pass off together.”
Go; go directly!”
“I cannot help doubting,” answered Danglars with his stupid smile.
“Well, read, then!” said the unhappy young woman, in the excess of her pride and joy, presenting a letter to Milady.
The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière.
“Oh, heavens!” cried Athos.
“Well?” exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.
“How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear Valentine?
“Ready,” said he, with his usual curtness.
See paragraph 1.C below.
You must depart instantly, monsieur.
He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper.
By the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence, and who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach no importance.

He resolved, therefore, to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count.

“Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall.
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted, the right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything ministers say, nor everything their enemies say.
He sighed and set to work again.
Then,” continued Beauchamp, “I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen.
Brave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly.
“Take courage,” said Grimaud; “they are gone to find assistance.”
“Who are you?” asked the wounded man, fixing his half opened eyes on Grimaud.
“This woman is full of mysteries,” murmured D’Artagnan to himself.
“Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here.”
You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not mean to say—”
I cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.
ho!” exclaimed the latter, “the cardinal!
“And what does Mademoiselle d’Armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil?”
First, M. and Madame de Saint-Méran incurred his displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir—three drops were sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier, who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch—he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over for her as well as the rest.”
“But he paid your ransom?”
Holloa, there, some bread!” he called.
“Where?”
Take her six bottles of different wine—Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get them at Borel’s, and be sure you say they are for me.”
de Boville, Receiver-General of the charities.”
“At the other end of the town.”
Never shall I forget your sublime courage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged myself to the foot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came to meet me.
Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?”
“Go on, go on,” said he, between his teeth, “expend your ardor the first day; to-morrow, instead of journeying twenty leagues, you will travel ten, the day after to-morrow, five, and in three days you will be in bed.
“And who was that?”
“Great God!” cried D’Artagnan, loosing his hold of her dress, and remaining mute, motionless, and frozen.
“Who goes there?” was asked a second time.
“You think so?”
His hand, always wonderfully beautiful and strong, was set off by a ruffle of lace, like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck.
“Do you think so?” asked the baroness.
“Oh, I am done with considering!
“And what did you do with the child?” asked Monte Cristo.
In the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, D’Artagnan, when awaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth—they had been so impressed upon his mind.

“Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want.
“Let me ask you why you deceived me?”
On the opposite side two cavaliers, one covered with a gilt cuirass, the other wearing simply a buff doublet, from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet, charged in front.
If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croesus.” Then aloud: “Are you ambitious?”
He immediately fell backward.
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.
“Madame de Longueville is ill,” said the duke, “and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty.”
On this promise being given, Porthos, who had never doubted his friend’s assurance, turned back with him toward the castle.
“What number was it that rang?”
At the same moment M. de Villefort’s voice was heard calling from his study, “What is the matter?”
Valentine was so pale, so cold, so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage crying for help.

He had no fears as to how he should live—good seamen are welcome everywhere.
VOLUME FOUR Chapter 74.
_Certes_, if the knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought, not of killing herself, but of killing the baron.
Only, D’Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from that man’s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of—”
In the morning, as he was mounting his horse, D’Artagnan, who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.

“Who does not love you?” Valentine smiled sadly.
My sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance.
In the position in which Raoul lay, unfortunately, he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard, nor his pistols from their holsters.
“Ah, madame,” cried Debray, “what is the matter with you?
They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted.
“I am at your command, my lord,” returned D’Artagnan.
“What, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded with silver—are they all for me?”
“You are right, your excellency,” he said; “this must be one of your friends.”
“And how was the anonymous letter written?”
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted.
“The baron knows, as well as myself, that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation.” The duke put his pen to the paper.
Here it would be dangerous; the house may be watched.
But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie, he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered.
“My good Nanette, be quiet, I beseech you,” said Broussel.
“No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to——”
“What do you want?”
“By a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark complexion, and a scar on his left temple.”
“His dishonor reflects upon us.”
The officer entered for the fourth time.
“People, in general,” he said, “only ask advice not to follow it; or if they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it.”
“And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in order to beg for an explanation.”
Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the Opera.
Do you know what those three windows were worth?”
Now, you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.”
de Chevreuse—who, though exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris, remained there five days, and outwitted the police—the king flew into a furious passion.
“You are mistaken, Porthos,” said D’Artagnan.
They were both aroused at seven o’clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant, who brought a letter for D’Artagnan.
The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more subdued tone.
It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of Lens.
Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta, ta; it is charming, let them finish—one moment.
D’Artagnan continued:
“Go, sir,” said the queen, with her most bewitching smile, “go and return at midnight.”
The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread.
Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other.
Valentine colored.
Bonacieux was explaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison; and the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.
Picture to yourself a pretty coach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept.
Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to them.
Although the Musketeer was not expected before one o’clock, the procurator’s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning that the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him before his time.
The army marched silently, the prince at the head of the column.
He has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him, and when he returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.”
Remember his name well and look at him well, that his face may not be forgotten, for this evening he is going to render us a great service.”
All four came up together.
“That they must have patience,” said Anne, “as I have.”
Ah!
“Dear Valentine,” said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion, “listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious.

“Yes.”
“Well,” said Mme.
“God bless his majesty!”

The blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe.
This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rhône.
“Yes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly.
He then said, “It is time to start; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o’clock, but perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.” Consequently, Morrel, having left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the clover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking eight.
“Yes.”
Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five days, and only left this morning.”
“But,” persisted the queen, “if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart, send him help of men and money, for I can do nothing for him; I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him.
Two days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o’clock in the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort’s house, and a long file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière.
They must disappear, broken, scattered, annihilated.
At that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light still shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion.
My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct.
“Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie settled.
At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the point of marrying her, when war came and carried me away.
D’Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he approached the window to read it.
A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain.
“Madeleine,” said the Gascon, “give me your apartment on the first floor; now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an appearance; nevertheless, reserve my old room on the fifth story for me; one never knows what may happen.”
“Pardon for whom?” cried he.
But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage, and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman, he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin, and in the hope of seeing her again, had asked for a leaden comb, which was allowed him.
“Oliva Corsinari!”
She fainted.
“You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?”
You shall soon have something to drink; I give you my word.”
Do these belong to the cardinal?
The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them.
The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness, “Whether _we_ return to the East, you mean to say, my lord, do you not?”
Athos repeated D’Artagnan’s words.
“It is evident enough to me, who am always at his house.
“Someone is talking in the street.”
I inquired immediately on my return to Paris; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had just been let for nine years.
“Ah, that’s it!” he cried, “you have your promotion and I my barony.”
Are the carbines loaded?”

He threw them on the table without looking at them, so sure was he of victory; D’Artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” he said, “you are to take this dispatch to the Bastile and bring back here the person it concerns.
Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground; but the horse and its rider, of whom he did not lose sight, were evidently sinking.
“Well, sir,” said D’Arminges, “it is the common lot; even an executioner is not exempted.
“What, even for me?” said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.
“Would you like better to be hanged in your true name, Milady?
While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.
Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience,—and the mob retired.
“That your eminence will go at once to the queen.”
All the ladies rose, and there was a profound silence.

“I know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,” replied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness.
Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.”
“And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,” said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy.
He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him.
“Not at all,” said Château-Renaud, slowly; “I think he is violently agitated.
It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.
Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance, that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries.
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty carbines were levelled at the count.
“Mercédès!” called a joyous voice from without,—“Mercédès!”
“How do you know?” Debray shrugged his shoulders.
“Pardon what I am going to say,” added he, “but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation.
D’Artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand.
“Merely to say these words: ‘I am going to send Monsieur d’Artagnan away and I wish him to set out directly.’”
“Let us see,” said the queen, “what the count says.” And she opened the letter and read:
what has happened?”
“Oh, he would kill me!”
“Two years.”
Mordaunt darted to the steps, understood all, uttered a cry, as if his very heart was pierced, and fell fainting on the stone steps.
This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.
‘Why, the good God sends him back again.’ Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair.
“That young woman whom the queen took out of prison.”
One only is still not in our power and braves us.
Sick of the smallpox at his age!
“The brand of England!—it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me, and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom; but the brand of France!—oh, by that, by _that_ I was branded indeed!”
“Very good,” said the queen; “you and your friend are worth an army.”
“Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; _one_ drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his respiration, and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was; ten would have destroyed him.
At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Athos.
“Yes, I insist on it,” said Albert, whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings.
“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit.
“Oh!
Their toilet finished, they descended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled with sweetmeats and bouquets.
They found him in the large armchair, which served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling sleep.
As we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.
Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had offered him a seat in his carriage.
“Gentlemen,” said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances,—“gentlemen, M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d’Épinay.” He, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in the person, gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect.
As I said, monsieur, Lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure from one end to the other.”
“Sir,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “call Mademoiselle Valentine’s maid, if you please.”
He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aramis.
“Yes; you have called Haydée your sister,—let her become so indeed, Valentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me; protect her, for” (the count’s voice was thick with emotion) “henceforth she will be alone in the world.”
Noirtier watched the expression of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude.
D’Artagnan!” he cried.
But alas, if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he was the enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.
Porthos is in Picardy.”
At a hundred steps, on turning to the left, you will find the wall of the park; get over it, and in three leaps you will be on the road and free.”
The captain was only waiting for his passengers; hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings, where they were to disembark.
When he had run over all these names in his memory, again read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his lists, he shook his head.
But not being able to stifle her, she smiled upon her.
“Reload the muskets, Grimaud,” said Athos, “and we, gentlemen, will go on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation.
“But go on signing,” said Monte Cristo; “I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and to Mademoiselle Danglars.”

“I am saved!” murmured he.
The Colosseum
If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been doomed!”
“‘And then there are robbers,’ said La Carconte.
The carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way, passed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honoré, turned into the Rue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.
“And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.
He probably had succumbed.
They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from D’Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, D’Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way.
Through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park.
The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune Amélie_ having expired, Dantès took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further.
Still further, the sea, very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed every day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of l’Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles, _roberges_, and feluccas.
“Alas, I have them no longer!”
The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.
“He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched against him.”
“I understand; well, I am come to ask a favor of you.”
“What have we to do?”
Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune, and having confessed him, after having learned everything from him, he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart.
“I am recruiting myself,” said Porthos, “I am recruiting myself.
No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes, for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:
“Yes, yes, yes,” signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.
Posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character, which history explains only by facts and never by reason.
“Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me?”
Only—the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were consumed.
“Oh, you’ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the discretion of ‘the doctor’s niece.’”
“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw it lying in a corner.”
But Peppino did not answer.
His breast was covered with a coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.
“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied him his good fortune.

“None at all.”
“A weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design.
He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman’s little finger.
“At all events,” answered D’Artagnan, with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal’s, “they beat them when they draw their swords.”
Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office, but two remained.
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.
“Oh, no, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Raoul, “you are such a brave gentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you!”
“You think so, my lord?” answered La Ramee.
“Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by signs.”

“The mother was a wretch, who struck at us all and at those dear to us.”
“I know it well.
“Follow me, monsieur,” said Mazarin.
Well, once returned from the country, half by the protection of her cousin, half through what we have personally done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire.
By your reckoning I must be forty-three at least.
You are still with us, I presume?”
“How, my fault?”
“For me?” said D’Artagnan; “are you sure of that?”
Speak!
“There!” said D’Artagnan, “we can’t be overtaken.
Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him.
“The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,” replied the lackey.
“I have.”

Yes—you.
“Edmond Dantès.
What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude!”
“Yes; the grand marshal did.”
‘Is there anyone in the lobby?’ said the president.
“I have not failed to do so, your Reverences,” replied the young man, returning their salutation.
He will treat me better the next time I see him.”
“And on what have you written all this?”

“It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,” replied Peppino.

Their joy was great.
“I think I should like the other fellow better than this one,” said Mazarin to himself, and he threw himself back in his carriage.
With five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year.”
“What nonsense!” said Franz, reseating himself.
Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has turned against me—I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost it.
That was the reason why I left my Chateau du Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux.
“It is right,” said Athos; “he has served your majesty longer than we have.”
“A bad reason,” replied Danglars, who reckoned on conciliating his keeper; “but I am content.

“These Gascons,” said the cardinal, laughing, “almost beat the Italians in effrontery.”
The count’s tutor, a man of the world and a bon vivant, up to his eyes in learning, as his pupil described him, often recalled the profound erudition, the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul; but as regarded grace, delicacy, and nobility of external appearance, no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte de la Fere.
“I understand,” answered Porthos, “I understand you perfectly, on my honor; two hundred louis, each of us, would be making a pretty thing of it; but what will people say?”
“I will make verses,” said he.
Two hours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite “dappled grays,” protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman’s regrets.
The queen, although already pale, became visibly paler and her face was contracted.
“Which they deserve, do they not?”
As to the time, it will not require very much more than the generality of wills.
Did he speak in your hearing?
This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that D’Artagnan’s adversary, while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same precision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a spectator of the fight—a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, “A plague upon these Gascons!
God will punish you hereafter, but I will punish you here!”
In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome appearance.
27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”
On the contrary,” he added, laughing, “if they want to see their Stuart they shall see him.
“Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true.
“At his country house.”
“Quick!
Now, Madame Danglars feared Eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of Mademoiselle d’Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,—an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw that Eugénie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers.
We have a rendezvous, you remember, at the Place Royale.”
It was thought rather dear, but people wanted to sleep, and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep?
Milady recoiled, uttering a cry.
As to my orders, since every one gives his own commands in our party, I shall end, if this goes on, by giving none at all.”
On the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the court, afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the accursed house.
“Did you know that I am at liberty?”
A fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke.
Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man.
“No, sire,” replied Athos.

“My dear Groslow,” answered Mordaunt, “you know the French proverb, ‘Nothing one does not do one’s self is ever well done.’ I shall abide by that rule.”
None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”
There are, indeed, some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant.
The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII.
“Oh!
“When do you want your twelve hundred francs?” said he to Caderousse.
But the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room.
Ah, _pardieu_, Tréville!
The day after the event, she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.”
“Very well, my worthy gentleman,” replied D’Artagnan, “pick out the longest, and come and show it to me this evening.”
Aramis, Porthos and D’Artagnan drew their chairs near him.
He opened a drawer and took out a purse.
I have not seen you, consequently I know nothing of your dinner.”
“That is a child’s reason, Monsieur Blaisois,” said Mousqueton in his most patronizing manner.
I cannot cry; at my age they say that we have no more tears,—still I think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping.
I found myself again in complete darkness.
“What sort of person is he?”
“Most likely,” said D’Artagnan; “I am one of his most faithful servants.”
“Madame Bonacieux!
Two other men descended after Danglars forming the rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop, they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors.

“I require, my lord, that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville, with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution.
With regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the fields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen.
“No, sire, but to buy your majesty.”
“Wait a moment,” said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register; “I have it—a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl.
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig’s departure, its route, its landings; and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation.
The host approached with hesitation.
Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.
I do not wish you to be seen leaving; our interview must be kept secret.”
“Well, my dear Mouston,” he said, “rest satisfied.
The queen had written, “The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty;” and she had signed it.
It was nearly ten o’clock.
“I never once doubted your doing so.” Monte Cristo chose this moment for re-entering the drawing-room.

‘They laugh best who laugh last!’”
“This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.”
Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little blue cloak.”
“Do not touch the axe,” said the king, and resumed his speech.
Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain.
His hands, gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous; his eye was calm and even brilliant.
“Precisely?” asked Debray, taking out his watch.
“Eh!
“But yet, M. Danglars appeared——”
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, “Mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso.
The steps were crowded with masks, who strove to snatch each other’s torches.
The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.
The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you said, ‘I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.’ And you said truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly.
“But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the young man naively; “I felt a great chill at my heart, and at the word ‘fire,’ which resounded in Spanish from the enemy’s ranks, I closed my eyes and thought of you.”
You have to do with that woman!
Andrea made a low bow to the count, and entered the adjoining room.
What has happened to you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?”
“I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in the hope the count would kill you.
“Insolent wretch!” cried Guitant.
These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions, and formed into pills.
“Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?” said Valentine.
“How do you think these garments fit me?”
When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude.
“Near here,” replied De Comminges, smiling; “so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are.”
returned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable.
Athos lifted his finger, and Grimaud was silent.
They were, therefore, somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the Hermitage, Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf, Porthos by the Rue de la Roule, D’Artagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain l’Auxerrois, and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy.
“I must tell you,” resumed Mazarin, “that it is in a double envelope.”
“Then to yours, monsieur—what is your name?”
“Look at my hat and cloak.”
“There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the culprits are discovered” (Villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are discovered, I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever they may be they shall die.
For shame!
The shortest follies are best, my dear Caderousse.
The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale.
“Well, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis.

It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests.
Do you understand now,” said the captain, “why no complaints are made to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?”
“How much do you require for my ransom?”
“No.”
“And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?”
“And what was Comminges saying to you in reply, my good Guitant?”
“Reverend sir!”
The man he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by pointing.
“I cannot make you share the fate I have planned for myself.
“Something in his favor.”
This timidity, which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated some in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred.
I have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me.”
“What’s the matter now, Planchet?” demanded D’Artagnan.
“Of what importance is this little reptile to you?” asked Porthos.
But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances.
“Patience, monseigneur, we are coming to it.
“We went out.
“Beware of a profane taste in your theological style.
“Yes, a horse.”

This gloomy fortress, which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor.
Then he had a moment’s hesitation.
“Oh, you do quite right, monsieur.”
At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday?”

There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.
Dantès redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods.
“Yes; Madame Bonacieux, with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted.”
The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment.
The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Tréville of the exploit of the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp.
He extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.
“Must Aramis do as much as I, madame?” said D’Artagnan, deeply piqued.
“Impossible,” said D’Artagnan; “we are under Mazarin’s orders.”
“Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.”
As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet available, he accepted the proposition.
“Oh, for pity’s sake!”
“I will wait until you come out.”
“What are you doing?” asked Milady, with surprise.
Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard with D’Artagnan when he was on duty.
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “if Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.”
Bonacieux.
Dead, dead!”
“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes.
You know that it was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedetto.
M. Morrel unhappy?” exclaimed the abbé.
“Scarcely longer than eight or ten days.”
Who would have come to the assistance of two strangers, two unknown persons?
“There,” said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings.
D’Artagnan lifted up his head.
And moreover, my dear child,” continued D’Artagnan, “I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian.”
Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.
D’Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues.
“Speak out, there’s a worthy fellow.”
“And even what I am sure of.”
The baroness rose hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her.
“That the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he could see.”
“_Peste!_” returned Albert, “I compliment you on it; I have its fellow”—he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket—“and it cost me 3,000 francs.”
Grimaud began to scale the wall again.
He had borne with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty, and hungry.
All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged.
Porthos, completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback, retired to his cabin and went to sleep.
“Well,” cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world, “my cavalier has attained his object.
“Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.”
Athos, when he reached his appointed room, observed through the gratings of his window, walls and roofs; and was told, on inquiry, by Comminges, that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where D’Artagnan was confined.
None of those interesting adventures fell in his way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.
“Decidedly,” said Danglars, with the perspiration on his forehead, “I must be under arrest.” And he threw himself back in the calash, not this time to sleep, but to think.
“You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment.
“Certainly not!
The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder; and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left Gaza.
“Immediately?” said Albert.
Felton began to descend the ladder slowly, step by step.
“Without doubt.”
But Harrison paid not the least attention to him, and entering the king’s room, followed by his companion:
“Yes!” answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen, as with one voice.
“For five hundred thousand.”
Comminges bowed and left.
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been.
I have,” replied the duke, “a way of descending from the ramparts.”
“Whom do you suspect?
“The truth is,” replied Dantès, “that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow.”
“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”
Do you hear it?
“They do not want my papers,” said Monte Cristo, “they want to kill me; they are no robbers, but assassins.
Athos nodded affirmatively, then turning:
But neither of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.
“I was inspector-general of the pasha’s troops,” replied Morcerf; “and it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief.”
In the evening, on his return, Franz found a letter from the embassy, informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day.
‘You will go to Marseilles,’ said Dantès,—for you understand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them.
“Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived.
The concert must be a delightful one.”
you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier?”
Tell me,” cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before, “did you ever reveal to anyone our connection?”
“Gracious me!” said Porthos, “there’s Phoebus ruined.”
Monte Cristo leaned against a tree, and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived, looked up and down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and carefully looked down the neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed.
I will not answer for them.
“Let us speak French, my father,” said he to the Jesuit; “Monsieur d’Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.”
“They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house, but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new possessions.”
“Yes,” replied the invalid.
“And who is this Cerberus?”
D’Artagnan understood, for while replying the captain had raised three fingers.
He took the arm of Château-Renaud, and turned towards the vault, where the attendants had already placed the two coffins.
“And what guarantee will you give me,” asked she, “if I consent to confide this message to you?”
I expected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it.
The valet left the room.
“Oh, yes; I am,” added the king, taking a handful of gold from La Chesnaye, and putting it into the hand of D’Artagnan.
Anne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that is to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.
pity me!
One day, Benedetto, who had been gone from the house since morning, to our great anxiety, did not return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey after him, which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree.
He, who returned to France with millions, had been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from hunger.
“All this will not advance your outfit,” said Athos; “for if I am not mistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you.
“Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you.
Then, my son, return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if I am wrong, still let me cherish these hopes, for I have no future to look forward to.
Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent.
“Everything, D’Artagnan, even folly, has its limit.”
Keep the struggle for yourself, bear all the suffering, but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts; for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her, and Providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty.
“I shall tell them, madame, and those who accompany me will say the same thing; but——”
here!
“What is the matter, sire?” exclaimed Lord Leven.
Your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require.”
I should be carried home in triumph like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus.
“A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any of these things.”

D’Artagnan, you are a great man; and when you occupy Monsieur de Tréville’s place, I will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey.”
“I want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you.”
The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred _flambeaux_ of white wax, a piece of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were ordered, and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon condition, said the report, that they should be played all night.
“Notary,” said she, “do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?” The old man again signified that it was a notary he desired.
Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger.
“Well, he is a man.”
“Impossible!”
Then suddenly, in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation:
“A friend!” exclaimed the count.
He goes two or three times a week.”
“Oh, have pity—have pity!” murmured Villefort, wringing his hands.
Villefort, while turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something press against him.
Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind.
Fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend Caderousse.”
And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo Rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, I don’t know but what I should have held on by my original plan.
“But how?”
This night I am determined to be free.”
“It is more important than you think, perhaps.
“Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful ambition.”
“My mother begs you to come.”
“And what I have suffered,” said the young girl, “you shall never know, my lord.”
“Your excellency,” said the man, “you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you, are you not?”
absolution.”
“Why, then they would be laughed at, and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at.”

“Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,” said Morcerf, somewhat piqued.
Let us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France has made us lose sight of for an instant.
I noticed them for their remarkable beauty.”
Fortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth.
Feverish and excited, I rang at the door.
Then there is his son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount, bearing the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into the Parisian world, aided by his father’s millions.
Monsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two friends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty, if we should meet him.”
Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the cup overflow.”
Hurry!”
He perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which D’Artagnan had hitherto resided.
“It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face.”
Then, with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage.
“Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,” returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.
“What more is to be done?”
“You see, monsieur, that you say it again.”
Chapter 84.
But man—man, whom God created in his own image—man, upon whom God has laid his first, his sole commandment, to love his neighbor—man, to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughts—what is his first cry when he hears his fellow-man is saved?
He had fainted.
No.”
“On you?
“Have you no letter for him?” asked the young man.
Pistache made violent signs that it was, by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively.
“I know it is very bitter,” said Valentine; “so bitter, that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.” Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter.
Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto.
“Long live the coadjutor!” cried the crowd.
“It is well,” said Dantès.
30301m
“Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.”
And with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued, however, with the perambulations of the day, D’Artagnan directed his course toward M. de Tréville’s.
“The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.”
“Who goes there?” cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.
The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged.
“The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the breast; and the third time, made this large wound.” The Englishman turned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved it to be a recent one.
“I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.
“So,” replied de Winter, laughing, “that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet seduced you, you heart of stone?”
“There and elsewhere.”)
“On the contrary,” returned Gaetano, “the chief, who was told you were a young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.”
“Ah!
La Carconte double-locked the door behind the jeweller.”
“Just so,” muttered Comminges, looking after Mazarin.
Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.
The regiments, the standards, and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct.
“And not more than justice, either, you ass!
“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.”
I have, therefore, received a very good education, and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor, whose masters made them grammarians, doctors, and philosophers, in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman market.”
Then he turned again to the clock, counting time now not by minutes, but by seconds.
On both sides loud cries arose—on the one side cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.
Rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a day’s journey from Surgères, whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.
I cannot reconcile myself to this idea—it would madden me.
The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of D’Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what probability was there that Mme.
Grimaud leaped down.
“And how so, if you please?”
But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height, dressed in black, apparently of a certain age, for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features.
But as you are the strongest, after all,” continued D’Artagnan, “don’t be furious with old men and women, and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions.”
And so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in his dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.
Do you see the waistcoat?
Twice he was obliged to step back; his opponent stirred not one inch.
Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they didn’t mean mischief.’—‘That’s my opinion too,’ said the captain, ‘and I’ll take precautions accordingly.
“Sir,” said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, “the ten minutes are almost up; I must return to my post.
“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.
De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramis’s finger.
I see you require proofs.
Monte Cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had sung his famous “_Suivez-moi!_” then he rose and went out.
“Oh!” said D’Artagnan, “that matters little.
The count, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing himself in the dressing-room, would be able to defend his property himself.
Aramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through Mme.
“Monsieur,” said Mademoiselle d’Aubigne to Scarron, as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with Raoul, “do you not admire Monsieur Voiture’s friends?
“Sir,” said the queen to him, thinking he was the leader of the band, “you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you myself.
If he did not come, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability, his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon dispelled every impression of fear.
It was only on the following day, at about ten o’clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M. Deschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small billet, which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before seen her writing.
Chapter 50.
“Ah, indeed?
The Gascon, therefore, instead of answering, growled out “Ja!
“There,” answered the traveler, pointing to the table.
In a creek lay a little sloop, with a narrow keel and high masts, bearing on its flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain _or_, on a sea _azure_, with a cross _gules_ in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled Calvary, the mount rendered by our Lord’s passion more precious than gold, and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy; or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage’s past life.
“Ah,” said Mousqueton, breathing more freely, “you are only going, then, to make a visit?”
“What’s the matter?
“Oh, I remember,” said D’Artagnan.
Besides, he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic—that is his word.”
“I know not; it must have been a mistake.”
he lost it the day before yesterday.”
“These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to him.
“Oh, monsieur,” said Caderousse, “make one more attempt—try me once more!”
“Ah!
The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson & French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him at the bankers’ door.
A woman lay on the ground, her head resting on the knees of a man, who was seated by her; as he raised his head, the woman’s face became visible.
“To be sure,” returned Monte Cristo; “it is very convenient, then?”
I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my care.
Morrel again changed color.
“D’Artagnan.
“Sir,” replied the mayor.
“That’s no affair of mine,” replied the Englishman, “that is the affair of the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act.
“But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive or dead,” said she.
Before Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this conversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone, she let her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: “But no, it is not for me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes.
There only his memory returned to him.
THE MAN OF MEUNG
During the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother, she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not the less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her happiness cost her very dear.
“How did you fare?”
D’Artagnan returned to change his workman’s clothes for his chestnut-colored suit, and Porthos to put on his red doublet.
“’Tis very dear living in England, my lord, especially as envoy extraordinary.”
Luigi slowly relinquished Teresa’s arm, which he had held beneath his own, and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille.
As we said before, by ten o’clock almost all the guests had dispersed; those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o’clock to one at Cours la Reine.
No, D’Artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time.
“That is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur.”
“And where was this letter written?”
I detest him!
“I expected him this morning.”
Come, monsieur, come!” and both set off towards the capital at full gallop.
Besides, Milady knew the masters, and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys knew Milady perfectly.
“In his study, Monsieur Procureur—in his study!” Villefort pushed, or rather forced, the door open.
M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much you care for his ill-humor.
This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing.
The news caused a great sensation throughout the house; Madame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was thunderstruck.
“And this room?” he asked, pointing to the captain’s cabin.
“Ah, monsieur!” replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea, “that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips.”
“With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.”
“Good!
“I’faith!
“Yes.” answered the abbé; “Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.”
He rose in his turn, and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats, with which the carriage was filled, cast them with all the force and skill he was master of.
“Oh, no,” was the tranquil response; “I am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort.
“Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine, No.
“If you are in haste, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days, “and if it be your will to dispatch me at once, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.”
The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little of my old trade.
“Monsieur de Morcerf,” replied the count, “your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;—nay, I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands.”
“The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.”
“Ah!
Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned round to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment.
“To my great regret, mordieu!
“I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?”
“No,” said Aramis, “he has not seen us.
“Ah, my lord,” he said, “have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers?”
he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.
“M.
The evening was no longer joy, but delirium.
By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare.
‘Now,’ continued Carlini, ‘if I have done wrongly, avenge her;’ and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Rita’s bosom, he held it out to the old man with one hand, while with the other he tore open his vest.
This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half fainting, into a seat.
“Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses, excepting his palace in Lucca.”
“I?
That is not difficult.
“Yes, since you have known me,” said Morrel, smiling; “but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.”
A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Chapter XI.
“It is a great honor to me,” returned Monte Cristo, “to be thus, on the first day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been equitable, but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja, or in the mountains of Atlas, a marshal’s staff to offer you?”
“Yes.”
“Ah, _wooi_, a vager!” cried the Swiss.
“I will help you.
“Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.”
“Let the irons be heated,” said the doctor; “but really it is a useless precaution.”
Oh, yes!
“Oh!” said Athos, satirically, “I saw him.
“No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my opinion (and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who have received the provocation)—in my opinion the time ought not to be yet.
There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition——”
You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion.
Milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges.
“Then, count, I admire you,” said Villefort, who, for the first time in this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur.
All that is in this grotto, my friend, my house in the Champs-Élysées, and my château at Tréport, are the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantès upon the son of his old master, Morrel.
Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position.
“Come,” said he, laughing, “there are all my hopes about to be destroyed.”
Porthos looked at D’Artagnan in astonishment.
As our fugitives approached the house, they found the ground cut up, as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them.
“What say you to that, Monsieur du Vallon?” he added in a low tone to Porthos.
That great giant who was there gave it to him.”
“_Armentières_,” read Porthos; “Armentières?
A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice box and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.
“Certainly,” he said, “your receipt is money.”
Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer.
Chapter XLIV.
They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated an event of some gravity.
“Keep near me,” said the latter.
“No, no, no,” said Comminges, who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were, “I clearly understood what the cardinal said to me.
How pale you are!”
“If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not be a house I shall see, but a palace.
Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I. and Charles I., furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.
“Let them pass; they are friends.”
This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid, of which it was impossible to discover the color, owing to the reflection of the polished gold, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, which ornamented the box.
“‘I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.’
“I do not know—I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners’ cells.”
That door is guarded, D’Artagnan; you know that.”
“Yes; and that was you!”
Tomorrow I will see you again, to take my leave.” With these words the baron went out.
“Yes,” said Milady, “Lord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not?
That’s ingenious,” said Athos.
“Madame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility.
“Who comes there?” cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who saw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief.
Not at all, my young man.
It was a human storm, made up of a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs, oranges, and nosegays.
“Or, at least, I will go—later.”
“True,” said Porthos.
“What are your Eminence’s orders?”
Bazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged vest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper part of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.
“‘You have had three horses foundered or killed?’ he asked me.
“‘Beware!’ said I, ‘for my liberty is your dishonor.’
There had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the revolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for the prevention of smuggling.
But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, “your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal.”
But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy.
20299m
She was still exceedingly handsome.
One division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard.
The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose birth he had witnessed.
“And you are right, my dear La Ramee,” said the duke, wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow, wide awake though he was; “after this I will think of nothing but eating and drinking.”
“Gentlemen,” resumed Aramis, “any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrested—for we have friends in Paris—but we are contented with another course.
To this Athos replied quietly: “We also have money left—for I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all theirs.
“No, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.
“In truth,” murmured D’Artagnan, to whom M. de Tréville’s recommendation recurred, “this animal will end by making me afraid.” And he put his horse into a trot.
“I agree with M. de Villefort,” said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort; “and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told M. d’Épinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation.
Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal.
“Good-bye,” said Château-Renaud in his turn, keeping his little cane in his left hand, and saluting with his right.
“And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans?”
This is what was done.
There he found everything arranged in due order,—the accusation, examination, Morrel’s petition, M. de Villefort’s marginal notes.
Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion.
What the devil makes him glower thus behind him?”
You were walking one day behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere.
“How can I tell you?” replied he; “I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about.” Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared.
“My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.”
“Wait.”
All would pay deference to an officer like you, with a fierce moustache and a long sabre, but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity.”
...essed of ingots, gold, money,
M. Beauchamp, it holds four very well, will you accompany us?”
“Why, your excellency,” returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency, “I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel.”
I know something of him.”
The groom cried aloud for help.
“Has he assassinated anyone, then?”
“Let us go to Rueil,” said Athos.
I will not sleep where I must scorn.
“I am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer.
Do you know Saint-Mandrier?”
“‘Why, your brother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a duel.
“A great age, you mean, Monsieur Porthos.
“I ask it humbly of you, my Lord,” said he; “sign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter.
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments, _quærens quem devoret_.
“Eh, dear friend,” said Caderousse, “are wills ever made without codicils?
The four friends embraced with tears in their eyes.
And Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very knightly habit.
I am just setting out for Blois.
“It does not bring him a bajocco.”
They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man could scarcely pass.
No human being, not even my sister, is aware of its existence.
He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this display of force.
“Besides what?” asked the Count.
Young men, take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command.”
At the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.
“To the beautiful Greek.”
At the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the Palais Royal, a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to Cardinal Mazarin.
“Oh, good lord,” cried Porthos, “what precautions for the study of theology!”
Athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration, ran to a closet and drew forth workmen’s clothes, which the four friends immediately put on; they then left the hotel, Athos carrying a saw, Porthos a vise, Aramis an axe and D’Artagnan a hammer and some nails.
He now arose, his head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp, dishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes,—someone by whose side he might weep.
As to the Bastile, they are not there, though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs.
“I had,” replied the count.
“Stop,” and Aramis gave him a louis d’or.
One of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of French, which he however wrote with great facility.”
March!”
The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive; but on the road an aide-de-camp, from Cromwell, sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle.
Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity.
“Will you be so good?”
“Advice.”
The demon had known how to wound him.
“I know that it is terrible,” said D’Artagnan; “but when I reflect that we have killed English, Rochellais, Spaniards, nay, even French, who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us, whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows—I can, on my honor, find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman.”
They continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted D’Artagnan to Rueil.
“I promise you it shall be done,” answered De Comminges.
“They suit each other remarkably well,” said Danglars.
It was purely and simply his removal, in terms clear and precise.
“The unknown giver,” interrupted D’Artagnan.
“What inconvenience can it be?”
The king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December of the same year.
“I do.”
The notes reminded the men that the children, women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons, their wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions.
“We shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope,” replied the duke.
“Here is Debray, who detests you without reading you, so he says.”
“I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden.
M. d’Avrigny smiled sadly.
“Yes,” replied Aramis, “and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination; now,” continued he, “if only De Winter does not keep us waiting.
“One of them was called the Chevalier d’Artagnan.”
“But you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to speak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great an ingratitude.
I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair.
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the night.
to the boat!”
THE AUDIENCE
As to Porthos, his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair.
How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?”
“Mademoiselle,” said the stranger, “one day you will receive a letter signed ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’ Do exactly what the letter bids you, however strange it may appear.”
The star of day, pale but nevertheless still splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration.
“Of me?”
“Yes, that’s it, no doubt!” said Milady, returning the letter to Mme.
I will embrace your knees!
_Dear friend_ to an Englishman,” interrupted Athos; “well commenced!
“I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten years.
“As for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of suffocation.
There was only this blow wanting.” Then he said aloud, “My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?
And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table.
What does he want with me?
His holiness had an idea.
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, “let us go.”
I bought it from him, but it belongs to D’Artagnan.
Well, happily, I don’t say nay to it.
“It is true, nevertheless.”
“Stop, gentlemen,” said Albert; “I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo.”
I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my presence within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart.
“Have they not heard that of their colonel?
“Barrois,” said Valentine, “my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire, but there is a secret spring in it, which you know—will you open it?”
where she was known as “La Belle Provençale.” She was the widow of the Marquis de Castellane when she married de Ganges, and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers-in-law, was forced by them to take poison; and they finished her off with pistol and dagger.—Ed.
“Unhappy man,” cried he, wringing his hands in his turn; “you love Valentine,—that daughter of an accursed race!”
“I suffered, that is all.”
7, prepared for him, was situated precisely the same as No.
When I call you ‘chevalier,’ it is in presenting you to my guests, that they may know who you are.
“Well, it is just for that reason that we have called you, my good M. Mouston.
Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step.
“And will you direct us?” exclaimed the young man.
D’Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen.
“I do, and I will tell you why.
He was, therefore, about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind.
A PROCURATOR’S DINNER Chapter XXXIII.
D’Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.
“Lord Wilmore.”
“He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the entrance, and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body.
With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-Méran and the death of the marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefort’s in connection with his attachment for Valentine.
“The register of my child’s birth?”
At length she felt his heart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder, announcing the return of life, passed through the young man’s frame.
“Here is his letter,” said D’Artagnan, and he presented the note to his comrades.
OFFICER Chapter LII.
At Vincennes, ’tis true, one lives faster——”
I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear, such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me, it would change the appearance of things.”
“Lieutenant yesterday,” said Aramis, “captain to-day, colonel, doubtless, to-morrow; in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of France.”
Bonacieux re-entered.
“All is lost!” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of the studs are wanting, there are only ten.”
“It doesn’t surprise me,” said D’Artagnan, in a low tone to Porthos, “that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his councillor.”
“Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tuscany.”
The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing, for a ship’s lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore.
“You have no idea, my friend, how my bones ache since I came here.
“It shall be done,” replied Bertuccio.
“That woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today.
Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots.
Wild, almost unconscious, and with eyes inflamed, Albert stepped back, and Morrel closed the door.
“The officer of the guard, then, with his chessboard?”
I have.
The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was awaiting him in the hall.
“You are a poisoner.”
Have two riding horses ready.
“A man.”
You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?”
What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me?”
I like that.
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks, or even tailors.
“You think so, Porthos?” replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which D’Artagnan alone understood.
de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that, yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent—only into which, nobody knew.
D’Artagnan turned to look at his friends.
With opium, belladonna, brucea, snake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in their way.
But this, Planchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captain’s commission I would not write it.”
“Where is that?”
“Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.”
“He called himself Vampa.
Chapter 9.
When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house.
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “from this very day; and mind, if the wine is bad, we will send him to find better.”
That’s strange!
Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier’s half-pike, tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king.”
You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the Musketeers?”
Dantès’ whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.
“Yes; but first give me this letter.”
“As well as you do, gentlemen; for I was among those who seized him in the garden at Amiens, into which Monsieur Putange, the queen’s equerry, introduced me.
Aramis related what had been agreed upon.
“And by what gate did they go out?”
“And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?” asked Milady.
He held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance, and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable: “Oh!” with such an expression of extreme terror that Mousqueton started, alarmed, and Blaisois was near fainting from fright.
“These gentlemen, Comminges, are not prisoners,” returned Mazarin, with his ironical smile, “only guests; but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors, that they may not refuse to continue my visitors.
He has taken part against his queen, or rather, against her minister.
“Then, my lord,” replied D’Artagnan, pointing to the purse which Mazarin still held, “if you love and esteem him so much, you—understand me?”
“Then I have your leave, sir?”
Chapter XLIII.
All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening; but he found Athos quite himself again—that is to say, the most shrewd and impenetrable of men.
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan; “but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose?”
I dragged myself as far as the yard.
However, he, like Cæsar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in order to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing that appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard.
“Did you ask for me, my good friend?” said M. de Tréville.
“Indeed, sir,” said he to Albert, “if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you, I shall resign the case to the king’s attorney.”
If by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt, tell Porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck.
“No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for him.”
“Oh, he won’t return; and if he should, he will be told that I have brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.”
Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance:
“Where you please,” returned Monte Cristo, “since I know nothing at all of it.”
“That is I!
There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.
“Ah!
In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I continued my path.
“But if he should be a cavalier?” said Porthos.
“Yes, really; it is owing to him that we are free.”
The Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carmela.
Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,—“’Tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.” Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail.
there’s the sun!
And to be free, a prisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor—all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way.
“Quick to the Louvre,” said he, “to the Louvre without losing an instant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal.
“There!” said Planchet.
Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire.
As a soldier the man ranks well; he did his whole duty and even more, at the siege of Rochelle—as at Suze and Perpignan.”
“Dead!—so suddenly?”
“No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.”
He then entered the room.
His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme.
“Nothing,” she replied with a violent effort.
On his return to the cathedral, D’Artagnan saw Bazin, who was conversing with the sacristan.
Where is Valentine, sir?
“That he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you as he appears.”
They are only four!”
They proposed a game of _bouillotte_.
“Wait a little.
“The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.” said Albert; “but we are not superstitious.
“The fact is,” said Porthos, with an air of finesse, “I am rather incredulous.”
Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed an expression impossible to describe.
One step farther into rest,—two, perhaps, into silence.
“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said Caderousse.
I am about, perhaps, to discover something here; I am in the vein.”
“Bring your comrades here, one and all; but let everything remain as usual, only close the shutters of the ground floor.”
I suspected where she was concealed.
The box taken by Albert was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled the “nobility’s boxes,” and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants.
The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eugénie sat near her, and Cavalcanti was standing.
It is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain.
The injured man had recovered his senses.
“Do you think so, M. Bossuet?
“What is that?”
“And will your Grace sign that order without remorse?”
“Be easy,” said Aramis; “I will take two poniards and give one to Parry.
“I!” cried Buckingham.
“With whom can it be, if not the Duke of—”
“Monsieur,” said Albert with affectionate courtesy, “the count of Château-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me; you are his friend, be ours also.”
“‘Ah, true,’ replied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.
But, now that the duke had escaped, the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock.
D’Artagnan smiled.
“And if the king permits me,” returned the Gascon, “I shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered.”
Alas, I understand.”
* We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when followed by a family name.
They might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they wherever they went.
Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in.
“And who spoke to him of me?”
From that time, D’Artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket of Mme.
“Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.”
“Well, monsieur, let us go to him.
You are of my opinion, are you not, viscount?
What do you wish for?
“Well, here it is at last!” said D’Artagnan, as he drew the letter from his pocket.
His long, dark hair, softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils, fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls; his voice was still youthful, as if belonging to a Hercules of twenty-five, and his magnificent teeth, which he had preserved white and sound, gave an indescribable charm to his smile.
“Patrick,” said the duke, “bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept.”
Louvieres recognized him and bowed.
“Sir,” he said, with desperate politeness, “it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as I have seen the Italian mummers do, whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in France.”
“She is capable of anything or everything.
Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp, how shall I now approach mine?
They then summoned their friends, who, with Blaisois, Mousqueton and Grimaud, promptly joined them, leaving Parry behind them, who was to take back to London the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys, which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him.
All this, set off by the presence of that excellent prince, who was so good-natured, who invented so droll tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin, made for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year.
If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.
“Who married the Marquis of Saint-Méran’s daughter?”
“Be punished _alone_, for the first, miserable man!” said Lord de Winter to Felton, who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea; “but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved.”
“A great man in his own country,” added Debray.
“That’s wise—not for the lackeys,” resumed Aramis, “but for the master—for the _masters_, we may say.
This chase was, however, advantageous to him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead, his heart began to cool.
“No.”
“Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.”
“Hark!” said Morrel.
Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the camp?
Charles’s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children, whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death.
“It is all one to me now,” said D’Artagnan; “I am no longer hungry.”
“Absolutely.”
That reply led to several questions about the king’s capture, and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely.
Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe illness, made his reappearance in the character of _Bertram_, and, as usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
At the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with astonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French, “Monsieur, I should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my brother.”
“This is fine!” said Porthos to himself; “I am prettily caught!”
20281m
Before an hour has passed you will be discovered, arrested, obliged to kill me, which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you.”
“At Auteuil?” said Villefort; “true, Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken.
The Hundred Days
“But what _have_ you done?” asked Franz.
“Sir,” said she, “I perfectly understand my grandfather’s meaning at all times.”
When De Winter perceived them, in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity.
The count had watched the approach of death.
For mercy’s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre?
Then they looked at one another.
Albert had often heard—not from his father, for he never spoke on the subject, but from strangers—the description of the last moments of the vizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens isolated pavilions.
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists; there were landscapes by Dupré, with their long reeds and tall trees, their lowing oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix’s Arabian cavaliers, with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces; _aquarelles_ of Boulanger, representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the sun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa, but more poetic; _pastels_ by Giraud and Müller, representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from the album of Dauzats’ “Travels in the East,” that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque—in a word, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past.
“My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father’s heart.
When I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.”
Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony, but on the same plane with everyone else, and without any particular privilege.
“My master will go to dinner.”
Hearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid and downcast, Felton reproached himself.
He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him.
I tried to speak.
The youth brought a small loaf.
“Today I am at your service,” replied the count.
“Then, M. Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen,” replied Barrois, “that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room.”
“Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it.”
He went to him.
“Fernand, do you mean?” replied Monte Cristo, with bitter irony; “since we are recalling names, let us remember them all.” Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein.
From being slender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his deep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face.
“What do you want me for, sir?” demanded he of the paralytic.
“I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?”
“Pooh!” said Athos, trying to smile in his turn.
“On!
At the door they found the carriage.
The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind.
“‘Judge not rashly’, says the Gospel,” replied the cardinal.
Haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes.
“Now he is gone, it is your turn to get out,” said Mme.
“Oh, pray name it.”
And he rushed out of the study.
At the end of an instant’s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle, and saw Milady’s carriage stop opposite to him.
“You forgive me, then, sir,” said Raoul, “and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young Indian?”
If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all would be over.
“You know well that we go to breakfast there.”
“What, then, are you?”
“Come, my friend,” said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on Peppino, “you will not refuse me a glass of wine?”
Their lackeys likewise were absent, and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other.
“Yes, your Eminence,” said Athos, while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand.
His vengeance, therefore, consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin; he even tried to make some verses on him, but soon gave up the attempt, for Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying, he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose.
“Be it so,” cried Aramis.
Why should I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual?
The first thing that met his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbé on the wall, by which he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died.
Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business.”
Do not forget your crosses.
These two men met at one point and that was, cunning; had they been actuated equally by courage, the one would have done great things for the other.
“‘There,’ said Caderousse; ‘and now, although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have your supper with us?
On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water, and it was again necessary to take a boat.
I am mad for her!”
It is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a most mediocre amateur of art.
He is badly off, very badly.”
The tree was easy to climb.
the prisoners are escaping!” cried the sergeant.
There were only chimeras and illusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality except illusions and chimeras?
They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall.
was it not I?
Mazarin, according to his custom, was thinking much and saying little.
“You think of everything.”
“Do not be uneasy,” said Mazarin; “it is the same.”
“Oh,” said Aramis, “I always try to be prepared; and then I knew you were seeking me.”
“My poor friend, I had forgotten you were in love.”
“At your command, lieutenant,” replied the musketeer, who saw the business was a serious one.
“Very well, then.”
He recognized Albert, but thought it better not to notice him, as he looked so angry and discomposed.
“Thank you, no, sir.”
“Shall we wait, or shall we charge?”
And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of the young woman.
“I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story, were you not?
“Well, what is Haydée to Ali Tepelini?”
“In the first place,” said Milady, “it is possible I may be deceived, and that D’Artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance.”
There is a proposition almost like it in the _Augustinus_ of the heresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner.
I believe in you, and I would have all the merit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity.
“How so?
“What?” answered Scarron, “I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux, who thinks ill of me, and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor, because he thinks ill of another man.
“Ah!
Caderousse’s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest.
La Ramee laughed.
To regret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion.”
“My prisoner!” he cried.
Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at last!”
“I believe so.”
“Ah!
“Here is what you are looking for,” he said.
“I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.”
Four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners.
“You?”
“We must content ourselves, then,” said Beauchamp, “with rendering the count all the little services in our power.
Keep the 50,000 francs you have left—I give them to you.
They looked hesitatingly around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of M. de Tréville; but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions.
“The matter is,” replied D’Artagnan, “that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman.”
I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly, for we have not an instant to lose.”
We have something very important to say to him.”
At last the heavy machine, which was called a chariot in those days, came out, rumbling against the gates, and De Winter, still on horseback, bent again to the door to converse with her majesty.
The Abbé’s Chamber Chapter 18.
“Faith,” he said, in Italian, as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals, “faith, there’s enough to pay five councillors of parliament, and two generals in Paris.
“The jeweller smiled.
On what was D’Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path, gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes smiling?
This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive.
“He has, then, charged me to take it from you.”
What I do care for now, is to make my way into the Jesuits’ convent; so to horse and let us knock at their door.
“Capital!” cried the Gascon, “you would make a distinguished general.”
“I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal,” continued Milady; “that would have been another motive for sympathy between us.”
Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed the subject of their parley.
Valentine started.
Ah, forgive me,” said Valentine, perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian: “I have done wrong, for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my heart.
At this moment Comminges rushed into the room.
“‘We dined so very late,’ hastily interposed La Carconte.
“What is that, madame?”
Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success.
“No, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did I should tell a lie.”
“Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you, since for the moment you have no master but God?”
Then she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.

“To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up Mazarin a little.”
“I promised to come,” said Felton, “and I have come.”
30087m
“And I,” said Porthos.
“You were very much frightened, then?” asked Beauchamp.
As for denying that I am your nephew, you will think twice about it, now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year ago.”
When you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a Lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!
“Why not?” said the Musketeer.
“Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor!
“You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred, take eight——”
“And how long ago was that?”
Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress.
“My Dear Maximilian,
We must go and find Lord Winter.”
Be not alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced.
“Why?” said the banker.
The door opened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed:
Noirtier made a sign that he would listen.
He still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening, and which had procured him so good a night’s rest.
I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.”
“She worries me in England as well as in France,” said Athos.
He turned towards the sailor, who, during this dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office, and asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel of any kind was visible.
“Yes,” answered Monte Cristo “happily, yes, conscience does remain; and if it did not, how wretched we should be!
“There are only two persons who have the key to that door,” murmured Morrel, “Cocles and Julie.”
And now, I am a Frondeur—not of Broussel’s party, nor of Blancmesnil’s, nor am I with Viole; but with the Duc de Beaufort, the Ducs de Bouillon and d’Elbeuf; with princes, not with presidents, councillors and low-born lawyers.
Abraham raised the knife against Isaac, and Isaac was his son.”
“There are only a dozen men at the most.”
“I gave one to the Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large, though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor, Pius VII.
Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.
As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may credit travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, but congratulated Albert on his success.
“He proposed to me to undertake it with him, and I agreed.”
Mercédès remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel went away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece; but, availing himself of the doctor’s order, the old man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery, and saying to Mercédès, ‘If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die blessing him.’”
Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner.
“Sir,” replied Comminges, “it seems that it is impossible.”
Quiet was at length restored.
“You meddle with politics, do you—and still more, with cardinalist politics?
“That man cannot injure me, Haydée,” said Monte Cristo; “it was his son alone that there was cause to fear.”
“What is it, sir?”
The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.
“Now begone,” said the count, pointing to the window.
Let us go to Monsieur de Beaufort.”
The two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.
“But,” exclaimed the young girl, “why am I thus pursued?”
Noirtier nodded his head.
U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
“No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water.
“My faith,” said Aramis, “I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians.”
D’Artagnan shrugged his shoulders, made a sign to his escort and started.
“That _is_ difficult,” replied Athos.
Your tilbury, your groom, your clothes, are not then hired?
“But where did he find it?”
This short interval was sufficient to determine D’Artagnan on the part he was to take.
You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world.
“Because I should never get a better.”
“Why, you said,” answered Mademoiselle Danglars, “that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals.”
During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame de Villefort.
M. de Tréville, moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang toward him.
de Villefort,” said Louis XVIII., “the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.”
They are alive, that’s all that I can say about them; from time to time I hear of them indirectly, but in what part of the world they are, devil take me if I know, No, on my honor, I have not a friend in the world but you, Rochefort.”
“Repeat it to me.”
“Gentlemen!
You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door.”
“Your horses are ready saddled in their stables, are they not?” he said, turning to D’Artagnan.
The young man rose and took a step toward her.
Oh, no!
“I almost hesitated, though,” replied the sailor; “you looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.”
“And my only heir, are you not?” said Lord de Winter in his turn, fixing his eyes on those of Milady.
“He can turn his coat inside out.”
I am an assassin, then, and not an officer of justice!” and he closed his eyes with a groan.
“Sign, my lord,” and he gave him a pen.
Grimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.
Reports were whispered about, like certain sounds which announce, as they whistle from wave to wave, the coming storm—and when they pass athwart a multitude, presage an emeute.
“And for myself—I will write to you, depend on me.
They took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, D’Artagnan was trotting along in the direction of Amiens.
He is very susceptible.”
“What do you mean to do with that purse?” whispered he.
“The scoundrel!” said Aramis.
The Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters at the Minimes; but, as we know, D’Artagnan, possessed with ambition to enter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his comrades, and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections.
In this way we shall not be separated for an instant.”
with patience one must succeed.
D’Artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect, and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal’s letter
“Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here without an order from M. d’Avrigny, or without speaking to the procureur.”
“Nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris.”
And he answered ‘that Monsieur Bazin went to Noisy.’ ’Tis his custom.
“Where am I?” he asked himself.
M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children.
“How, cannot be?
“He spoke the Romaic language, did he?”
“It was the only letter you had?”
“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and write what I dictate.”
It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort’s for the purpose of returning the procureur’s visit, and at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in confusion.
The weather was dull and stormy, a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.
The sight of this, instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.
“You see plainly that I have no sword,” said the Englishman.
“Look at me,” said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive—“look at me.
“So distinguished an individual as yourself,” cried Albert, “could scarcely have required an introduction.”
And she placed her hands on her brow, as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment.
Let me see what time it is.”
Each word that fell from his companion’s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth.
Poor Edward is as much M. Noirtier’s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if she had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left her all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.”
“If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet, you would not have known me.”
A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.
Athos alone remained seated, calm and thoughtful.
Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression.
The men of my crew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard.
“But,” said the abbé, “I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.”
“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.
“Unquestionably.”
I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination.”
When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad lying senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.
“Impossible!” said D’Artagnan; “those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward.
In fact, four men such as they were—four men devoted to one another, from their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one another, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or turning toward a single point—must inevitably, either subterraneously, in open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well it might be defended, or however distant it may seem.
This letter told Buckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding, “If your succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will surrender,” it added, quite simply, “If your succor comes not within fifteen days, we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes.”
“Let us set out again, at full gallop.”
“Well, what do you wish me to do?
Père Pamphile had seen Dantès pass not ten minutes before; and assured that he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring.
“Oh sir,” said Raoul, suddenly, “you recall something, which, in my haste to relate my exploits, I had forgotten; it is that there was with Her Majesty the Queen of England, a gentleman who, when I pronounced your name, uttered a cry of surprise and joy; he said he was a friend of yours, asked your address, and is coming to see you.”
“He will know what that means.”
“No one will come,” said she; “do not fear, there is our safeguard,” pointing to the bed.
“You must be Satan!” cried she.
“At least that of the minister.”
“He is really out, sir,” replied Baptistin.
You have received a regular letter of advice?”
“Now to supper,” said Aramis.
“Alas!
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier, but as a gentleman, I say that you are very culpable.”
“Grimaud, my friend,” said the viscount, “will you leave me thus, in such anxiety?
He would not sell his horse; not for a kingdom!
“But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?”
The felucca went on, the boat continued stationary, rocked only by the swashing waves.
She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule, which were beautiful to look upon.
“Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown?”
“Why not?” said D’Artagnan, with his wise smile.
“It is Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
We will now relate what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have just detailed.
Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed.
Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.
incendiary!
“Thank you, monseigneur,” he said, drawing back; “I am paid.”
“Felton,” cried she, “you are as great as Judas Maccabeus!
“No; explain yourself, I beg.”
“That’s the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat-o’-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders the head weak, therefore you may be excused.”
Raoul bowed.
Dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service, till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities.
And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it?
Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for the first time noticed the white lips.
“And,” said Madame de Villefort, “I need not ask you if you share that fancy.”
“Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.”
“Do you, then, love Mercédès?”
“Why not?”
“Then,” said Athos in a tone of delight, “he is well?
The deputies bowed and left the room.
Nevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, D’Artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man.
“Yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once.
He had not done so for ten years before.
Never mind; be content, I will do my best.
La Ramee went out.
But to you, at least, M. Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known.
Besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner.
“Then you will lie here,” said D’Artagnan.
Fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the quay.
Besides, his intention was formed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened—if conquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of foul play and want of courage.

“What, the mercer’s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs?
He looked around him and saw Mme.
One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there.
I charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself, my dearest sweetheart.”
The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o’clock.
“Yes, sir, you shall see them.
The day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous.
D’Artagnan!
Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and there, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which transported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs, ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins.
“M.
“‘I hope you will not complain now?’ said the jeweller.
“I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,” continued he, “and the most profound respect for his actions.
The four men stood motionless.
He clung to one idea—that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea, devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.
“Eyes of an admirable expression?”
“Preoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did not observe that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard—I did not lose a movement of his features.”
“When?”
The _facchino_ follows the prince, the Transteverin the citizen, everyone blowing, extinguishing, relighting.
When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he said, “Ah, now!
“We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove.”
Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak.
So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes.
“Ha!
“Ah, yes,” said Porthos, “there is nine o’clock.
The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor, observed, “He will become religious—he is already more gentle; he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets—madmen are not afraid of anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.” Then, turning to the prisoner, “What is it you want?” said he.
“I?” said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man, “I can’t keep on my legs?
“Willingly,” said Aramis.
D’Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.
He immediately signalled it.
It was now the coadjutor’s turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres.
“I,” said Mazarin, with his most smiling expression.
“Bah!” said Milady, with a smile that belonged only to herself; “you forget that I am her best friend.”
In the meanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman’s happiness, and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings.
“Really,” said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation.
All eyes were fixed on the door, which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity.
“Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o’clock precisely.”
Come, have you committed some crime, pursued by human justice, from which I can protect you?”
You can suppose, Porthos, that what I have to say relates to most important matters.”
Come, then, as early as you like—at seven o’clock; but beware, if you and your Musketeers are guilty.”
“Young man,” said he to D’Artagnan, “a suggestion.”
Without this, Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell.
Three companies presented themselves, each offering equal securities.
“Where he is going—to visit Athos.
“Bravo, bravo,” said Franz; “things go wonderfully.
Arrived at the end of the lane, D’Artagnan turned to the left.
“Whence comes that money?”
“Well?”
I too, sir, was almost dead when you arrived.”
Debray stretched himself upon a large couch, and Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle Cornélie.
“With all my heart!
Dinner was waiting, but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon, Franz sat down without him.
“Hush!” smiling as he uttered the word.
Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind them.
“I would almost answer for Planchet.”
All three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools.
“Blue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and eyebrows?”
“In that case it would be quite another thing.
In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street “Les Bons Enfants” behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the play of “Mirame,” and in which Mazarin, who was an amateur of music, but not of literature, had introduced into France the first opera that was ever acted in that country.
Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I think, quite unnecessary.”
Dantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so terrible!
It might be expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in Monte Cristo’s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money.
“Yes, let the sermon be clear,” said the curate.
“He shall be tried,” said the cardinal.
“It is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the seventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in order to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up, and proposed a cast of dice.
“My dear vicomte,” returned Monte Cristo, “I do not see, in all I have done, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the pretended eulogies I have received.
I cannot thus, in a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with which a father’s untarnished name inspires a son.
“He is a great commander, Bragelonne.”
“From whom?”

“One instant, sir,” said the man in a gown, whom he addressed; “a plague on’t!
Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband, she took him on his weak side.
I know that name——”
It was a chaise drawn by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort’s lackey would precede it, as courier.
There was a moment of complete silence, during which Dantès, still listening, knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.
Still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain.
“And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from you.”
“I think it will be wise to set off,” said D’Artagnan.
“But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?”
“Oh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil,” replied the host, with a grin of contempt; “for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns—which however, did not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had happened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later period.”
Come, Fernand, won’t you return to Marseilles with us?”
Anne of Austria took two steps forward.
The blow, so they tell me at least, was struck with a master’s hand.”
Besides, the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me.
“There’s nothing I wish more,” replied Mazarin.
“No one must disturb us,” he said; “I must speak freely to her, accuse myself, and say”—he approached the door, touched the crystal handle, which yielded to his hand.
Then observe, too, that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex.
20245m
Aramis smiled as one who hopes.
Raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince:
“I promise, my lord,” replied Mordaunt; “but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply?”
My dear count, allow me to show you the way.” They passed silently into the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.
“He is at Marseilles.”
20222m
There is the Prince de Condé——”
He has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal effects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it.
“Because he is an actor in the drama.”
“No, for I will not allow you to do so.
“Oh, my Lord!
The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald.
“Well, Louis,” said Anne, “why do you not kiss me?”
“No.”
Instead of raising it, thought he, they have lowered it.
“Besides, my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes,” continued La Ramee, “and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beaufort.”
The servant understood them.
“Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke?” asked Patrick.
“Ah, your honor, how can you say so?” exclaimed Friquet.
Have you, by any chance, been in the Bastile?”
His air of perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy.
The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it, and, selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack, placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every nerve to move the mass.
The little hand was then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations.
“Yes, my lord; but, as you have said, two that are a match for twenty,” said Athos.
was born.
“‘In another week you will have left Beaucaire,’ remarked Caderousse, ‘for the fair ends in a few days.’
Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced—from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination.”
“Sir,” said Valentine, “my grandfather wishes for a notary.” At this strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged looks.
You have seven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly became King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.”
“Yes, yes,” continued he, “’Twill be the same as it was in England.
“These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,” said Morcerf: “they might satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him his plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.”
That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers and the courage and conduct of D’Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.
“With whom are you going to fight?”
“Fatality!” he muttered.
After finishing that calculation, I had a minute’s hope.
“These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth, that every eye was fixed on the count’s forehead, and he himself passed his hand across it, as if he felt Ali’s blood still lingering there.
“Why not?
What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort?”
The mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on the table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the young man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to him.
But in what force was the enemy?
M. d’Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes, and watched her hurried retreat.
They told him so frankly, and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy.
“And, more especially, a notorious coward.”
Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and a seal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance.
“I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.”
“He has already been invited by my father.
All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars, who had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow.
When they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the moon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost.
War has broken out in Flanders.
“Were you stopped?” eagerly inquired the two youths.
Still more, the light which had shone for an instant disappeared, and all was again in obscurity.
“I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not conceal anything from you.”
“Athos, she is your wife, I tell you,” repeated D’Artagnan; “only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.”
It is not he!
But as for me, I have been a coward; I have denied God and he has abandoned me.”
“I would swear to it; what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what I have seen in the other cases.” Villefort ceased to contend; he only groaned.
Fernand became deadly pale.
D’Artagnan jumped into the saddle, then the old companions in arms again shook hands.
“Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover a gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry.”
“How did Danglars usually write?”
“To be sure, I remember it all now.”
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him, and he then examined his dreadful wounds.
“My poor Eugénie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.”
A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking.
The count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of Danglars.
You do not like Dantès?”
“I have as much.
“With gratitude.”
“Monsieur d’Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,” said Milady, in a hollow tone; “Monsieur d’Artagnan shall die!”
“Herself.” At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned his salutation with a smile.
“To be sure,—why not?”
“Now, madame, nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage,” said Chatillon, who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Athos.
“Didn’t you hear me tell you, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that I don’t know where he is?”
“Yes, but,” answered La Ramee, trying to laugh, “a ladder of ropes can’t be sent around a ball, like a letter.”
During the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear, owing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal tenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts, frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.
It was many years since D’Artagnan had opened his heart to any one; it happened, however, that these two men, on meeting again, assimilated perfectly.
A gentleman turned around.
“What was his name?”
I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival.”
“No, sir, not at this moment at least.”
Sometimes we don’t go to bed at all!”
Porthos opened his mouth to reply; D’Artagnan made him a sign, and his mouth, remaining silent, gradually closed.
The same evening, when the flock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a sort of stylus.
“Do you promise?”
Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant, this dear child and myself must both have perished.”
“But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club prize?”
“And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick.”
“Nothing I should like better.”
“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.
Pray come to my aid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?”
Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn.
“Oh, make yourself easy!—I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon know what I mean.
The police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer.
“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we.
After going about thirty paces, he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther, evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow Gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend.
Well, he thought of me, when he saw the king was taken, and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king’s name that they would stop, as the king was hungry.
The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea.
“Younger sons,” he said, “who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names.
“I slept here last night and the night before, and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed.”
The host was at his door and everything was prepared—bed, bandages, and lint; and a groom had gone to Lens, the nearest village, for a doctor.
And he threw away his pistol.
“You will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,” continued Felton.
“And your business is——”
“I have.”
Besides, a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which _La Jeune Amélie_ replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had come.
ha!
But he stopped, doubtless to reflect; for instead of allowing his first impulse, which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter, to carry him away, he leisurely descended the staircase, left the palace with his head down, mounted his horse, which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu, and with his eyes fixed on the gate, waited until the queen’s carriage had left the court.
“Do you think he suspects?” said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness.
Nevertheless, he understood it all, but was deaf.
As long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the Bois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master.
For example, look at the puritanical procureur, who has just lost his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family, in so singular a manner; Morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of Benedetto; besides——”
“Let M. de Rochefort enter,” said Mazarin, eagerly, on hearing their names pronounced; “and beg M. d’Artagnan to wait; I shall have further need of him.”
As they were going down D’Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader.
“What can you mean?” asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.
On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne, and, in two parties, had set out for Paris.
“And then?”
“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed Morrel, “I do not deceive myself—that young man who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant, is Albert de Morcerf!”
40032m
“I am at your service, sir,” replied the major.
“We are about to have the honor of charging you,” replied Aramis, lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.
have they then offered a large one?” inquired Cromwell.
And your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite a style about them.
“I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows.”
I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.”
Athos invited D’Artagnan to follow them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o’clock in the morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.
He fancied that they buried the dead at the Château d’If, and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château frustrated his projects.
Either they respect or they fear me, which is more likely, but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs, insult and obstruct every one, and I come back still more weary and low-spirited, that’s all.
Yes, keen and cutting politeness.
“Yes.”
“There are no bandits,” cried Debray.
“To the sheets,” said he.
“Oh, you may speak before his excellency,” said he; “he is one of my friends.
1.F.4.
“It is he!” cried Porthos.
The English—do they dislike wine?”
“We do not give ourselves twice over,” said D’Artagnan; “we have given ourselves to you; command, we shall obey.”
A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column, and was reading with his back turned to the arcades, through the openings of which the new-comers contemplated him.
“And who completed it as it now is?”
“When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked God, for I thought I was about to die.
The two friends saluted the duke.
Gentlemen, good morning.”
It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alone—long enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud.
“Then tell the men to be in readiness—don’t tell them why now.
Come, tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you.”
At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal, Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges.
Chapter LXXVII.
“All I can tell about her,” replied the countess, “is, that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she has never missed a performance.
“Here we are!” said Athos.
I receive him among the number of my friends.
“So would you!” said Mazarin, looking with astonishment at those two men.
“How acts the judge?
It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought.
“As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father’s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the wedding festival here at La Réserve.
Bonacieux kissed his wife’s hand, and set off at a quick pace.
Monsieur Bertuccio
The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of _La Jeune Amélie_, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres, or about eighty francs.
“Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer for it.”
“I thank you from the depths of my heart,” said the young man, taking the spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo.
Besides, you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a woman.”
It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had started, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back.
And at these words Felton, feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner, rushed out of the room.
“No, no,” he said to the patron, “I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness.
“Athos, my friend!”
“True, monsieur,” said Mousqueton; “and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting-house.”
Come, this is no longer our home!”
“Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room in the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us, and you can dress there.”
“And where is she, then?
“’Tis your fault,” answered Porthos.
“Light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling.”
“Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.
“Father,” said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, “sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,” pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.
Guard her!
“Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house officers, and two or three gendarmes—all heavily armed.
He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars.
I once endeavored to go down with two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage.
“The Gascon is the devil!” cried Athos; “nothing escapes him.”
The clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down.
“Yes, yes!” cried both young men.
D’Avrigny returned about eight o’clock in the morning; he met Villefort on his way to Noirtier’s room, and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept.
Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.
But when I have found them, then tremble, sir.
That’s the whole story.
In their stead D’Artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.
The coadjutor started.
“Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor.
“The miserable villain!
Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter.
“Yes.”
Planchet and Bazin came last.
There is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the old.”
The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely.
“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, “nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”
“Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,” said Lord Wilmore; “he is a miser.” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing no other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.
And she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a small poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then threw herself with a bound upon D’Artagnan.
Such is the atrocious logic of revolutions.
“All at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.
How were you to blame in that affair?”
“Here,” he said, “take this pocket-book.”
From behind the door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only stared, hoping to recognize Morrel.
‘You cannot think of going out in such weather as this.’
to be sure, yes.
“I am told that there is a general insurrection.”
“Now, sire,” resumed Aramis, “listen to me.
We say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior.
“Then you are vexed with the engagement?”
Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual, raised his sword, and instead of pronouncing the customary formula, “I make you a knight.
Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening.
“Not all!”
‘Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn’t dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor?’ He signified assent; only think of the poor old man’s being so pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor!
I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool; the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with, but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present, so that my foe was pelted instead of me.
I sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an agreement with him to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year I took that lesson.
“The same as yesterday?”
“Break his arm—wound him—but do not kill him.”
Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy, but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of monarchs.
With the first light Dantès resumed his search.
“Oh,” he said, “he is mad!” And as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street, for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done.
“We are four of us,” said D’Artagnan; “we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time.
“Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,” she replied, feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was Madame de Saint-Méran.
If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the liberty, of the lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it he will look twice.”
Ah, my mother, my poor mother!” said Albert, gazing through his tears at his mother’s portrait; “if you know this, how much must you suffer!”
“My dear friend, we must take people as we find them.
“Silence for Monsieur Porthos’s idea!” said Aramis.
“Of course—of course,” said the prisoners;—“anyone can see he’s a gentleman!”
“I am young and strong; I believe I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power of will.
I fancy I remember it.
This child of the desert was in his element, and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he raised, like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane.
As to M. de Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was evident all the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment, did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past.
“There,” said he, “there is the work complete.
The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard someone speak his name.
It must be done.
“Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded you had stolen—that was all.”
Do not lull yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary—and it is I who say it—see enemies in all directions.
On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race!’
Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn.
You have a good memory; repeat what I have told you.
“But the others,” said the queen, who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel.
It appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh information awaited him.
“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere!
“His Eminence is not his holiness, sire.”
“No, but you can take out two or three boards of the partition,” answered Blaisois, “and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet.”
Blaisois was the tall youth, half groom, half peasant, whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne, whom Athos had christened by the name of his province.
“I have both seen and heard her.
“Yes, certainly,” interrupted Monte Cristo; “but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one.
“Advance, gentlemen,” said the cardinal.
The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves.
“How I came there, or rather why I am there,” replied Bonacieux, “that is entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don’t know myself; but to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged Monsieur the Cardinal.”
Of course it is of no consequence,” he added, with a withering smile.
De Winter followed his look, observed his feelings, and guessed all.
But Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror.
With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there, where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of France.
Your advice, then, is—”
“And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?”
“Yes.”
“You are right,” said the countess, “and my fears are weakness, especially when directed against a man who has saved your life.
“Ruined?” said she.
He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens, determined beforehand to act with or against the court, as his congratulations were well or ill received.
“Pardon me,” said he, “my dear baron, but one of my friends, the Abbé Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not having seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait.”
“Eh?
“He is a bold fellow,” said the cardinal.
Chapter 58.
“Ah!” he said, “it is sad, I know well, to be forced to yield thus; but, pshaw!
“You had only read a line or two,” said D’Artagnan; “read the letter again from the commencement.”
Here I await thee!”
The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the “Holy Week” that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage.
“You see, we had each our mission,” said Porthos; “mine was to guard you and I am doing so.
“What!” said he, “does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated?”
It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king.
Our game is beaten up.
Did you really think me capable of that?”
“How?”
Fortunately, you won’t be laid up more than a fortnight.
brava!” cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the selection came to an end.
He stopped at the end of the corridor and said:
He began his day by breakfasting substantially—a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head, but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body; and about two o’clock he had his two horses saddled, and followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete.
Nevertheless, I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.”
“To its address, my lord?
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well.”
Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment.
“‘Seek whom the crime will profit,’ says an axiom of jurisprudence.”
Yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and that is half the battle.”
D’Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to the ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but nothing, absolutely nothing!
The marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact, and authorize you to appear under that name in the Parisian world.
“You came through Meung, where something befell you.
There he stopped, breathless and panting.
“Certainly.”
“Ah!
I uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this child.
“Hush!
“Ah, what else is there?” said Danglars; “for, at present, I cannot say that I have seen anything extraordinary.
“Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond’s misfortunes?”
Tell your client that, although I am the insulted party, in order to carry out my eccentricity, I leave him the choice of arms, and will accept without discussion, without dispute, anything, even combat by drawing lots, which is always stupid, but with me different from other people, as I am sure to gain.”
“What is the king doing?” they asked.
Make use of it, then, whenever you think it will be most useful, for my eldest son’s welfare.
The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously.
The heights of Pindus towered above us; the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the distance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles.
“Come, come,” said Danglars to himself, “now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted.”
Morrel started.
“Before you quit us, count,” said Julie, “will you permit us to express to you all that the other day——”
It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground, and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf.
“You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Haydée, and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace.
This letter was in Milady’s handwriting; only this time it was addressed to M. d’Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.
The escape was fixed to take place at seven o’clock; there was therefore three-quarters of an hour to wait.
“I mean that my friends, officers in the guards and mousquetaires, came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting, drinking, dicing.”
The ever-new passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure, sometimes fire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death.
“Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?”
A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy.
“Hold your tongue, you stupid fellow!” said the young man; “I am D’Artagnan; don’t you know me?
“Some of that at the bottom, near the laths.
“His mother!” he repeated.
Oh, father, do not look in that way at me!
the fate of our friends, to say nothing of our own, is perhaps in that very despatch.”
yes!
The dog turned his back to the cane.
“May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given Madame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?”
how many have you, then?” asked D’Artagnan.
“I shall still take precautions.”
“Yes.”
“To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.
Milady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time.
“But you know he is now our friend?”
A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID Chapter XXXVI.
“By force?
Ah, thanks, Felton, thanks!”
“Yes, a small declivity to the south, yonder on my hill, gives me twenty hogsheads.”
The cardinal has said several things which have agitated me, therefore I will not speak more fully now.
“I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,” continued the count, “and here is proof of what I say;” and, approaching the desk, he removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he had begun, and took the latter in his hands.
Clemency is a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive advantage therein.”
“They are all here,” said Caderousse, briskly.
“A keeper,” replied Grimaud.
“Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don’t dare to tell you.”
A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and half-stifled sobs.
“Try me, gentlemen,” said he, “and I swear to you by my honor that I will not go hence if we are conquered.”
Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the wandering visitors of Monte Cristo.
And at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady sank, weak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who, intoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart, all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom.
“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations.
He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk.
The poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.
“Let us visit this one first,” added he.
The sergeant made a sign, as much as to say he did not understand French, and D’Artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures.
“This same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style,” said the messenger, carelessly.
“You know his business here, then.”
“My friend,” said he, slowly, “I wish, as the son of an ancient friend—for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true—I wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy.
The next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him and Aramis in traveling costume.
The Gratitude of Anne of Austria.
England needs tranquillity at home, in order to consummate the expulsion of her king; France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch.
The count smiled, as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply, and he again turned towards the veiled woman, who soon disappeared at the corner of the street.
“And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces?”
The victory was complete; twice he had overcome his doubts.
“The Musketeers are, as you know, picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the Swiss.”
Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them?”
at your age!”
let’s fly the feather before the wind; let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life.
Moreover, he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures.
As for me I will give my last sou for it.
Happen what will, the devil take them, they can’t eat us.”
“Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?”
Aramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville, where Madame de Longueville was sojourning.
No, my daughter is not guilty.
“Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening.
“Bravo, Monsieur Grimaud!” said Athos; “and now take this.
Will you believe the government of a republic, a kingdom, and an empire?” Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp.
Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.’
“I hear a horse’s steps; it is my brother setting off again.
He judged that the match would be so much the less equal, if Athos and his companions were really plotting; and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command, all his anger faded away into a smile.
As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.
“Good luck to you.”
“That is true, monsieur, you are well informed.”
Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him.
“What, you don’t know me?”
By day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells.
“Yes, if I am killed,” said Albert, laughing.
“Don’t you understand, Porthos?
“Oh, you are a thorough democrat,” said Monte Cristo, smiling.
I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul.
“_Peste!_ let us not lose such an opportunity,” returned Monte Cristo.
He arrived in time.
At this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not prevail.
“What must be done?”
“Thank you,” said Albert, with a cold and formal bow.
And how does M. de Villefort bear it?”
He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression, and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.
At eleven o’clock Albert had not come back.
Title: Twenty Years After
Come in, Tréville.”
“Horses, nowadays, are not what they were formerly,” observed Porthos; “everything degenerates.”
“Come, Guitant, speak, if you please, respectfully of these gentlemen,” said Mazarin; “don’t you know that I was in my youth a poet?
As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands.
D’Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue Cherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called.
“Yes, my lord.”
“And now,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “entertain no further doubts about me; I undertake all that concerns the king.”
“Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for.”
“Come, magistrate,” said M. d’Avrigny, “show yourself a man; as an interpreter of the law, do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it.”
Not a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone waited anxiously.
Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought, as if he were fighting with himself; then, going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock, he took from it a bag of silver, and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to D’Artagnan:
“I do not care where I live,” said Kitty, “provided I am well concealed, and nobody knows where I am.”
As he had said, on a camp bed, dressed in his black doublet, booted, unbelted, with his felt hat beside him, lay the king, overcome by sleep and fatigue.
The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced.
“Oh!
Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or say one harsh word.
“You are the inspector of prisons?”
“I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a time.”
Do you know about that institution?”
You know it is you alone whom I love.”
Why, he is surrounded by sultanas, like a Turk.
“But others wish that you should go there.”
“For what?”
There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or Greek, whom here you call ‘good women,’ who do not know how, by means of chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor.”
“If I once went up those stairs.
Alas!”
“Yes,” said Château-Renaud, “these Italians are well named and badly dressed.”
“Grimaud!” replied Athos.
The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do.
“Yes.
Bernouin introduced him.
“Where must we place him?” demanded the chief.
“So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life.”
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
I will denounce this place of infamy.
The Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their swords grumblingly.
This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.
Athos now descended the ladder in his turn, without losing sight of the young man.
“Excellencies,” said he, “the coach is ready.”
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart.
Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself half-fainting into a chair.
“Yes, yes,” he murmured, “I am in the hands of the brigands of whom Albert de Morcerf spoke.” His first idea was to breathe, that he might know whether he was wounded.
We will do the same.”
You have a longboat?”
“Six hundred.”
“Well, shall I send for some breakfast here?”
“Give all the information in your power.”
“But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,” said Danglars.
“Where is she?”
“And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my father?”
At this moment Villefort returned.
“It was I, the Comte de la Fere,” said Athos, rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse.
D’Artagnan took up his camp tin cup, filled it with wine and arose.
He saw the deputation from the Parisians enter it; they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen.
“Now, in my turn, let me give you my instructions.”
A horse slips and injures a joint; a horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a manger in which a glandered horse has eaten.
“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”
He sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust.
I will say, then, _Monsieur_, quite short.”
“Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.” Artless as she was, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and besides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance.
Dantès smiled.
This operation proved as great a success as the first.
“Oh, he was, decidedly.”
“The address, ‘To monsieur the Baron Danglars, banker, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.’”
And Aramis?”
You sent me a strange madman this morning!

“Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?”
“No, it would delay me, and I need the fatigue you warn me of; it will do me good.”
“The past—that obscurity on the past.”
During this time he occupied himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.
“Well, I can’t say I had much choice of going or not going, for I was taken to him between two guards.
From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?”
1.A.
Here is night coming on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody can guess where we are.
“My dear grandmother,” interrupted Valentine, “consider decorum—the recent death.
“Every one likes his own uniform best, my lord.”
My death, believe me, will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure.”
You went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had the nightmare—that’s all.
I am on my own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character.
“Is he in bed?”
Who are these gentleman?”
“But that ought to be visible.”
M. d’Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered.
This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him—a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois.
don’t you see they are trying to catch your eye?”
I see, my lord, I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud!”
“And what do you suppose is the count’s age?” inquired Mercédès, evidently attaching great importance to this question.

Villefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney.
At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed.
he was alone again!
“Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain.”
“I am the Chevalier de Rochefort,” answered the other, “the equerry of Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his Eminence.”
‘Monsieur the Abbé,’ said he, ‘do you like blows with a cane?’ ‘I cannot say, monsieur,’ answered I; ‘no one has ever dared to give me any.’ ‘Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the Abbé!
Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere.
“Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry me back.” Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.
One of them went away, and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement.
The Beggar Chapter 65.
The president rose, appointed three members to accompany him, and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes.
“In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife?”
The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen him, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and then springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte d’Aix.
You call yourself, in Paris, the Count of Monte Cristo; in Italy, Sinbad the Sailor; in Malta, I forget what.
“Your excellency will judge for yourself.”
I have a very good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect confidence in him.
“No!—you undertook to do so.”
“This instant, sir—this instant, I beseech you!” said the old lady.
Mercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there is a wide difference.
“Then,” said Milady, “since you are as generous as you are loving—”
“Eight hundred livres.”
Grimaud Speaks.
“Be off, you wretch!” cried Aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.
Italy: Sinbad the Sailor Chapter 32.
Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness, even the gayety of the queen’s manner.
The Insult
Grimaud Speaks.
It was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that Franz’s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum.
Caderousse, who had raised himself on his knees, and stretched out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his hands, and raising them with a desperate effort, “Oh, my God, my God!” said he, “pardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art indeed man’s father in heaven, and his judge on earth.
For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and of unimpeachable fidelity.
The count followed her with his eyes.
“Amen!” cried the young man, and set off at full gallop.
“Now,” continued he, addressing Planchet, “you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter; you have eight days to return—in all sixteen days.
Who sent you?”
“And then he was older than any of us,” added D’Artagnan.
“Near the barrels stood Selim, my father’s favorite, whom I mentioned to you just now.
Albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume.
“No, no,” cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall.
All we require to insure success is courage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient in; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours—you shall now see me prove mine.”
“They say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,” replied Aramis, with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.
“Which means that you now hesitate?”
“For what purpose?”
The general depended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars.
“Madame de Villefort?”
Monte Cristo and Haydée took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to say, without sugar.
After a few minutes of silent embarrassment, Athos spoke.
Farewell.”
“Hear the end.
“Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?”
“I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?”
“Now,” said D’Artagnan to himself, noticing that silent play of countenance, “I am sure of it.”
“No, you are right,” said Athos.
will you permit a grandson of Henry IV.
I hold this serpent in my hands.
“Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the drawing-room.”
“No, I have never injured her.”
“Have you no friends who could assist you?”
“Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”
Let the man go, D’Artagnan; let us save the woman.”
“No doubt, my boy; no doubt.
Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth.
“Whence can it arise, then?
“Without doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there.
What is there in them?” he added, putting his lantern on one of the casks.
The porter knew him, and let him pass, only calling to him:
It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel—certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention.
See paragraph 1.E below.
Chapter LVII.
“Count,” she said, “Bragelonne must be a charming place.
you have been to sea?”
Never had he been so well received.
There are moments—for if everything is not good, everything in this world is not bad—in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion, heart-arraigning sentiment: one of these momentary impulses actuated Anne.
He had his foot upon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his.”
my darling!
“Well, the man whom I offer you is a general syndic.”
“That is well,” said the king, retiring, “that is well; I count upon it.”
“Well,” said the young man, “let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits.
“Indeed!”
Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love him for showing so much interest in you.”
Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair on end.
D’Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.
D’Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.
“In the time of the cardinal people fired better than that, do you remember the road to Crevecoeur, Mousqueton?”
“I am acquainted with it; before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment.”
Morrel seized their hands, and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs:
“But,” said Andrea, “why do you not act on the advice you gave me?
“But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each other.
Look at Monsieur Mouston, see the honorable wounds he has received, observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance.”
“I hear,” she said, “that Paris is not quiet.
By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he would find it.
“I can do something better than that, sir, I can speak Flemish.”
D’Artagnan blushed.
The young man, standing up before her, gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome.
She will repent, and no one will know that she has been guilty.
“Because the fifth is dead, as I hear.
He showed the more respect to this queen, deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers, as he felt some self-reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice.
Everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror.
They have rarely been successful.
“That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor’s revenue could not suffice for the coming month’s outlay, has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs.
As this was the height of D’Artagnan’s worldly ambition—apart, be it well understood, from his desire of finding Mme.
The steps were already down and the door open.
Sheathe, then, if you please, and follow us.”
“To make your will?”
The old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all so; and then, when D’Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good.
It led into the park, as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces.
“Tired?

As for the Duc de Beaufort, he arrived from Vendome, according to the annals of the day, bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair, qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces.
“Enter, gentlemen, enter,” said the queen.
The Judge
“You have dared, my lord, to imprison her majesty’s musketeers.”
You will find him quite enthusiastic.”
Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?”
“He is going to fall!” cried Morrel.
If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none, remain where you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter.
But he was a man of stone.
At the end of two hours, as Porthos did not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.
“Sir,” replied Olivain, respectfully, “allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning.
He was stout, had a short, thick neck; he was attacked with apoplexy, and I was called in too late.
“I do not understand you, sir,” said Raoul.
The people were shouting and running about with torches.
Ah!
Louis XIV.
Do you understand me?
The approach was not such as to prepossess people—an ill-smelling, dark passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Châtelet.
Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised.
“At the same time,” added Château-Renaud, “your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditti.”
Fortunately, nothing is lost by this delay, and you are now about to hear it.
It was just in time, for Valentine’s head swam, and she staggered; Madame de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage, saying:
Then D’Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful.
We have circumvented Cromwell, Mordaunt, and the sea, but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Mazarin.”
“So young,—it is impossible,” said Mercédès, replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.
He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman.
“I do not remember what he did, but I have inquired and I have been told all about it.”
“You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.”
“Come,” said Athos, “here’s another good servant.
“The same as ever, my friend; it is said that he is married to the queen.”
“Yes, here, in this convent, my dear fellow.
The doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage.
“Your Majesty’s orders shall be executed; but—”
1.F.5.
Again, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet, amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.”
“You have no idea, then, Morrel?” asked Château-Renaud; “you do not propose anything.”
“Be kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.”
The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man disquieted.
“Let this victim to Baal be sent, To the lions the martyr be thrown!
“To save the king?” said D’Artagnan, looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos.
I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword, while I am only moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman—there we are about equal.
This evening with you, to-morrow at Stuart’s, the next day with me.”
“But you will be left alone?”
Then he went to see his mother, who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone, and had kept her room.
She wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave it to Mme.
His calm, noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head.
I am not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most important engagement.”
Monte Cristo put his head out of the window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the steward disappeared.
His presence produced a good effect.
“Scarcely so much.”
“‘Thank you,’ replied the jeweller, ‘it must be getting late, and I must return to Beaucaire—my wife will be getting uneasy.’ He drew out his watch, and exclaimed, ‘_Morbleu!_ nearly nine o’clock—why, I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight!
“It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress—Valentine alone.
“Capital,” answered the mendicant.
“I have told you this, good sir,” resumed the host, “in order that you may be on your guard.”
“_Pardieu_, that is exactly the worst of all.
Twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and at last the clock struck the half-hour.
I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king.”
I believe, on my soul, that they never mean to finish it.”
Three days after, about seven o’clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to Sèvres.
The baroness became enraged.
“Yes, I see too plainly that it does exist.
Hello, here is my watch!
I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne; I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this, where I have been concealed between two mattresses.
“Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?”
But I do not mean, my friend that we were right in what we did.
“RICHELIEU”
Besides, what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal!
After walking for about ten minutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds; three men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the centre.
It was easy to do so, and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored my project.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.
From that moment he grew very guarded.
No one better.”
The day on which D’Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province.
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion—something he had till then doubted—he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.
As was his custom, D’Artagnan presented himself at Milady’s at about nine o’clock.
“Would you believe it, monsieur?
“On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?”
D’Artagnan smiled; Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names, Mousqueton to cut his short.
“Yes, but we have drowned Monsieur Mordaunt.”
These two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment of the finances.
“Fire, then,” said Athos.
“Come, come, Signor Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.”
He had my love!
“We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend—we have been guided by an invisible hand,—a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter.”
“This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the questions.”
“Yes, indeed she is,” replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone.
General d’Épinay died five minutes after.’”
Tranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with D’Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athos’s dwelling.
In the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim:
I was not so in my youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles.
“I will tell you all,” replied Anne.
“Oh, I need only one of them for the time being.”
In passing through the gate, the hilt of the lieutenant’s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak; in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal.

The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier down on the ground.
It is impossible.

Then he added with a certain uneasiness, “Did you meet them?”

Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life.

“What do you think of our lover?” said he.
“That proves,” returned the abbé, “that you are like those of Holy Writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.”
He however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance, but also without too much humility.
“I always obey, madame, when I am commanded by so gentle a voice.”
“It is not my fault, madame.
“Courage, courage!
“The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles.”
At first he had been followed through astonishment, then with derisive shouts, then the porters had insulted him, then children had thrown stones at him, and finally he was obliged to run, to escape the missiles.
“What has become of them?”
“But suppose they come unarmed?
“Ah!
“For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the survivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape.
“Why, this is the way of it,” said the minister, with the gravest air in the world: “Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to ‘serve the good king.’ These were his own words, of that I am certain.”
“We must not do so?”
I have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.”
When you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since, by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?
“I have not breathed a syllable to them.”
One opposite to me, the other with his back to me.”
that Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldn’t serve Mazarin.
“My lord,” said Athos, “we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your health.”
“Not too well.”
“In that respect, my dear friend, it’s delightful.
“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”
Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarin’s than to a queen admirable for firmness, without doubt, but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right.
“From whom?”
Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence, the play of which had been, nevertheless, subdued by age and experience; and D’Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look, very different, indeed, from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant.
“I have been a captain in the queen’s guards for twenty years,” was the reply.
“And whose room is this, my dear child?”
“No, on the contrary, I am not inclined to laugh,” said Athos, suppressing a sigh.
Besides, one must lay out one’s inheritance somehow.”
Bonacieux hesitated to continue.
Oh, if you know him, tell me!”
“Indeed, sire, I did not.
you will not?
He said, ‘As to your friend, tell him he may sleep in peace.’”
“As he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation.”
“Yes, in some respects, tolerably well.”
As the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended.
Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it.
“Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who, grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?”
“Yes, pardieu!
“It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug, which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him.
“Yes.
“What are you thinking about?” said the king; “go on, my good Parry, unless you are tired.”
“Really, Athos, you would make a singular general.
Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it.
“I got such a fright last night,” replied Dantès, smiling, “that I have almost lost my memory.
“You, my lord?”
“Yes,” repeated the executioner.
“And you ate in your carriage?” asked Morcerf.
His words were brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques.
Aramis opened the paper, and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read “D’Artagnan.”
These leaders had corn in abundance, and would not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim—for they, too, had maxims—that it was of very little consequence that women, children, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy.
“I wish you to do so,” said he.
“Well, do me the kindness to take my purse, which I left on the mantelpiece.”
“I am thinking, sir, of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested.”
“Have you tied the knot?” inquired the first speaker.
Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate, who was going to the scaffold to die—like a coward, it is true, but he was about to die without resistance.
“Then why did she go, just God?”
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become.
They descended into the plain by the ladder.
“No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.”
They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay.
In brief, I regained your harness and then mine.
Franz looked up—they were opposite the Rospoli Palace.
“I was,” replied the procureur; “you begged me not to leave.”
“Valentine,” said Morrel with a trembling voice, “I had waited since half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the fatal event——”
Why did you not have him arrested while in Paris?”
But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the distance which separated them.
The Duc de Beaufort.
“Monsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder?
“Exactly, sir.”
“By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her.”

“That is it,” said the old man’s eye.

“And you think that your wife—”
Morrel opened the letter, and read:
Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.
He had a haughty bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial.
believe me—guilty as I was—oh, yes, I, too, have suffered much!”
“I was about to propose so doing,” answered De Bragelonne.
D’Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume.
Bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman.
“Move, monsieur—move away, I entreat you; you are exactly in the spot!”
To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her.
“And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?”
Signor Pastrini did as he was desired, and returning five minutes after, he said:
“Oh, count.” said Julie, “will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy?” Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance.
“And me also,” said Porthos.
“How is that, Mousqueton?”
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit, the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting, that she began by complaining of it.
Let them hold themselves in readiness to march to-night.
If you had seen at what a pace he came—like the wind!”
We separated at midnight.
Then he carried Haydée to her room, resigned her to the care of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly this time, he again copied the destroyed will.
“Is that all?”
Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time, when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man.
“An enormous one.”
Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which Monte Cristo had forgotten.
“Well, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little.
D’Artagnan, who was by nature very curious—as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue—did all he could to make out who Athos, Porthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name)—Athos in particular, who, a league away, savored of nobility.
“Low-born fellows!” ejaculated Porthos.
“What, again?” she exclaimed, in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob; “really, you pain me.”
No, it will all go well; M. d’Épinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.”
Albert started on hearing these words; the history of Haydée recurred to him, and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring, and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave.
“I did not come to Rome to see,” said Danglars aloud; then he added softly, with an avaricious smile, “I came to touch!” and he rapped his pocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.
Chapter LXXV.
“My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,” pursued the lady.
The nails, too, were turning blue.
D’Artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets.
Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.
“And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you?”
Give me your horse, Porthos.
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my stepmother, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild.
“You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but let me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.”
We must fire as long as we have loaded guns.
I do not deny the influence of which you speak, or that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good.”
I have brought him up.
Chapter IV.
For a moment D’Artagnan thought that Parry’s brother had disappeared; but he was mistaken.
Can you, sir, produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?’—‘Alas, no, monsieur,’ replied the count; ‘all those who surrounded the vizier, or who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not where.
“I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some horrible ‘oubliettes’ constructed.”
“Well, I,” said D’Artagnan “I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot.

“Bravo, D’Artagnan, your opinion is mine,” cried Athos, “Besides, we must be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany me.
The Meeting Chapter 91.
Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the garden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in.
“Devil take me if I taste one of them!” murmured Porthos to himself, and then said aloud, “Thank you, my cousin, I am no longer hungry.”
“That’s a pity,” said Athos, coolly.
“I mean that all these cries, all these complaints, these curses, produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all; but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it.”
But even if you had caused me to wait a little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours.”
“Yes, with Frenchmen, and Frenchmen like you.”
Stronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to write the work you speak of?”
Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud.
Chance is so capricious.
“Now, jump down, Athos.”
“Porthos!”
But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself?
“Let us see,” said Aramis, “how are we to act?”
Come, then, on another occasion you can be firm and strong; but to-day is not the proper time; to-day, flatter and caress, or you are only a common woman.”
“No, count,” replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general; “in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt—if indeed there existed one—and I feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject.
As soon as he arrives inform me.
“Alas,” he exclaimed, “how can I restore the happiness I have taken away from these poor innocent creatures?
“Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden.
“We shall go out all the same.”
As for us, we were three days without anything to eat or drink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest, when we saw _La Gironde_; we made signals of distress, she perceived us, made for us, and took us all on board.
“Then Mazarin is still Mazarin?”
“And me,” said Athos, “—she is my wife!”
“To that I can say nothing,” returned D’Artagnan, who knew the vanity of the new baron.
During dessert, the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage.
It must have been delirium; she fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass.”
Have you wanted money, father?”
“At once.”
“Yes,” was the laconic reply.
“You have exhausted every resource?”
Then there was the ring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand.
D’Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of men.
“And our masters?” asked Blaisois, stupefied by this harangue, delivered with an air of profound sagacity, “will they be of your opinion?”
It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which to-day we are trying to perform for Charles I.; but, none the less, Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty years.”
I suffered frightful torments.
Wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out!
Then all looked at each other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and yet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly free.
I seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not turn around.
“Are you quite decided, Albert?”
Among these thousands moved, in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred, pale and haggard men, clothed in rags, who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words: “Behold the misery of the people!” Wherever these men passed, frenzied cries were heard; and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions.
The valet re-entered.
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking; and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his companions.”
Consent, then, I beg you, madame, to write at the bottom of this schedule, which has been drawn up by Mazarin, as you see:
“Danglars,” said Edmond, smiling, “I will say to you as Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, ‘Do not give me a title which does not belong to me’; that may bring me bad luck.”
“This time I did not content myself with looking, but I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and sprang over the wall.
The Workmen.
This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named, but not until after a stormy discussion, generalissimo of the army of the king, out of Paris.
I doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in that delicate, fragile body.
de Château-Renaud exaggerates.”
“What?” asked his Lordship.
“Madame,” he replied, “Monsieur d’Artagnan’s prediction has been accomplished; they are calm, as if by enchantment.
Then, after dinner, on the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son, previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually, were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker’s servants, so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon.
Oh, I have done well!
“Yes.”
We must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which D’Artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which, from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the simple Musketeer’s uniform.
They say joy never hurts, and so I came to you without any warning.
The letters being finished, each put his own into two envelopes, so that no one, without tearing the first envelope, could discover to whom the second was addressed; then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters.
but, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead.
“M.
Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.
“Is it by permission that he remains there?” asked Gondy.
“Why, good Lord!
A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.
“I am going wherever it may please the count to take me,” said Morrel, with a smile full of grief; “I am under his orders for the next month.”
In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers.
“You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,—still beautiful, witty, more charming than ever.
And you, Monsieur du Vallon——”
“Yes.
you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either.” Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his story.
“To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.”
“At the Saint Gervais bastion,” said Porthos.
“Yes, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly, which, with all due respect, I fancy he is anxious still to do.”
Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief.
Monte Cristo smiled.
“Five millions!”
“And yours, Monsieur d’Herblay?”
“Why, my companion.
She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake; but D’Artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.
In spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantès turned to the nearest gendarme, and taking his hand,
Charles was indeed in the midst of them, his hat on his head, his brows bent, striking his boot with his riding whip.
Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return with an embroidered uniform!
Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king’s countenance, M. de Tréville felt himself something like Samson before the Philistines.
“High walls?”
“Still higher.”
“I cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she was dead!
“This way, gentlemen, this way!” he cried, directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out.
“Lord Wilmore.”
My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches.
Well, then, your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus.
“He says he is German, my lord,” replied Raoul; “but I doubt it, for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective.”
More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon what was going on in his own household.
Na—Ne—Ni—No——”
It remains _here!_” said Porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it strongly.
let us not lose a moment.”
“And how was M. de Saint-Méran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?” said the count.
“Seventeen!” replied Albert.
“Now, sir, I am listening—go on.”
“Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not a family name.”
You must be cruelly bored here.”
The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon, and offered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him.
Mercédès, although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere she had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her palace to a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed.
“I will try; but don’t touch me.”
“I am your prisoner,” said Aramis, giving up his sword to Porthos.
“Never!”
Chapter 26.
His majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred; is so loyal that he does not suspect treason!
“Alas!
“Have you served under the usurper?”
“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on the 1st of March.”
“I choose that which the red-headed boy is leading.”
“Do you refuse?” said Mercédès, in a tremulous voice.
Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame.
“Chevalier,” said the king, when the door was closed, “I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions.
“I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for me?”
So the matter ended for the Abbé Faria.
“Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman.”
“Yes,—I fear.”
We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having traversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small house, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room.
“I have a miraculous balsam for wounds—a balsam given to me by my mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.”
D’Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally; which he did with the conscientiousness that D’Artagnan carried into everything.
“What has happened?”
“I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my left—yes, there.
At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared; then the queen, with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents, repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the subject.
“What have I to fear?”
“Pretend to sleep, Louis,” said she.
“Aramis, you will certainly laugh at me, you will say that I am always repeating the same thing, you will call me the most timorous of visionaries; but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man?”
“Come, come,” continued the count, “I see you are still the same,—an assassin.”
30263m
The monk turned pale, wiped his brow and went and bolted the door.
“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it.
The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving.
“Well, I should say!
The baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugénie’s character, could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection.
“Well, how is he now?” asked he.
To undermine the ground for fifty feet—to devote three years to a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea—to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty, sixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past, then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore—were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme, resigning himself rather to death.
The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer.
As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and left him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away.
“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome.
“But what do you advise, then?” asked Mazarin, trembling.
Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.
“So, so,” replied Porthos.
I have an infernal spirit.
“Because you are a coward, Planchet.”
In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers, and you have not an idea, my lord, how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort; I am of Monsieur de Bassompierre’s party.
La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately opposite to him.
“Two hours and a quarter, my officer.”
“Had you not a meeting with my son this morning?” asked the general.
We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are.”
“I know it, and I expected this result.”
“I—I return to Paris.”
“Return as soon as you can, Florentin.
“To call for monsieur le coadjuteur.”
It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron.
He freed his weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.
“Why,” said Groslow, “that is just what we are taking him to London for.”
“I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which means royal,” said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, “took me by the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed, we went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the prisoners, saying, ‘He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.’ Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without saying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was divided amongst the prisoners.”
“Alas!
Why, your protégé, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!”
“Indeed,” said the cardinal, “whatever repugnance I may have to directing my mind to such a treason, your Majesty compels me to think of it.
Noirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.
“See, De Winter,” she said, “I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen; and that is that my children call me ‘mother’ instead of ‘madame.’”
We started a stag of ten branches.
Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.”
Besides, let me own something to you.
At five o’clock precisely, the count arrived before the house at Auteuil, followed by Ali.
“And no steel-traps?”
Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind.
“Am I to say what you told me?” asked Valentine.
What I have always wished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and independent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to myself.
Bernouin shut the door and went away.
There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not succeed in doing so.
what are the Turks to such men as the Comte de la Fere and the Abbé d’Herblay?”
The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray.
He had therefore purchased a vault, which was quickly occupied by members of his family.
I regret I did not inform you sooner of this circumstance.”
“Hush; he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee.”
Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone through the affection I hope you will grant me.
As D’Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself, Porthos believed he had not been seen.
“Certainly, sir,” replied the viscount.
Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square.
At this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, Franz gave up his seat to him.
Only to think of it makes my flesh crawl.
He did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse.
He was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who had often examined his weapons,—which were very beautiful,—if not with envy, at least with curiosity.
Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.
The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock, in which she counted twenty-three bank-notes.
I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had experienced death, ‘is it painful to die?’”
Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from Bengal; panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those that appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway, and so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on the most luxurious bed.
Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de Tréville!
“Shall we go forward?
Even Ali, who had hastened to obey the Count’s summons, went forth from his master’s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while, as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron’s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master’s happy reverie.
This menace smothered the young man’s passion.
“When do you propose going thither?”
“Unfasten it, or I will break it in!” said Grimaud.
Valentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.
Mazarin arose, walked some moments, thoughtful, but not dejected.
The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it, by reason of the cold; but suddenly feebleness, occasioned by loss of blood, obliged him to sit down.
The next morning D’Artagnan ran to find Athos.
0213m
You believe so?”
“What papers?”
“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?”
“So it is, my dear vicomte,” said Athos, laughing, “to make bad ones; but to make good ones increases fame—witness Monsieur de Rotrou.
Two hours thus glided away.
“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”
“Put it into my portfolio.”
“Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.
“Yes, but with a jovial partner and dice, and guineas clinking on the cloth, the night passes like a dream.
An elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent horses, they were soon at the Place Royale.
D’Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme.
“Reflect, gentlemen, that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence.”
“Himself, my lord.”
The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu; then they gained the private staircase and D’Artagnan was ushered into the oratory.
“Oh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!—seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition—to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant—who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living!
If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.
“_Parbleu!_” said Athos.
“Aramis!”
“It is he!” cried D’Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each having recognized his man.
“Ah,” said he, “they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.” The president, without answering, approached the witness who held the lantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received in his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat, displayed his side, pierced with a third wound.
“_Cedant arma togæ_,” said Villefort with a bow.
“Can all this force be summoned on my account?” thought he.
Do you not remember him?”
“If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,” said Athos, coolly, “it is useless; you will not find her.”
Who is he?”
Grimaud dictated.
He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn than the old one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was something.
As for Raoul, he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him, turning his head away in repulsion.
She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at D’Artagnan with an air which said, “You are very amiable, no doubt, but you would be _charming_ if you would only depart.”
This evening, you said.”
We cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly.
If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken—Maximilian started as if he had been electrified.
“What is the meaning of all this?” inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.
“Yes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.”
“But this second letter,” said Athos, “you forget that; it appears to me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened.
Every one stood up.
“You who weep for pleasures fled, While dragging on a life of care, All your woes will melt in air, If to God your tears are shed, You who weep!”

TRIAL Chapter LXVI.
Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal, to whom he transmitted the messenger’s words.
“_Diable!_”
He then motioned to his wife to take leave.
“Faith!
We can go to Brussels, Liège, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasbourg.
The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.
“Indeed,” said the receiver.
“Stop a minute,” answered Caderousse; “we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.”
“D’Artagnan,” said Athos, taking his hand, “you know I love you; if I had a son I could not love him better.
That is why Valentine passed through her room, which was on a level with Valentine’s, and only separated from it by Edward’s.
“What is the matter, monsieur?” said Planchet.
“It’s a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven,” said Athos, evidently much relieved.
“Well?” asked the duke.
His mouth was large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child’s face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young.
This time he had decided to relate all that had passed.
“He is asleep.”
“The Scotch?” inquired Winter.
“And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?”
He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.
“I regret infinitely to tell you, my lord, that you are mistaken,” replied the Gascon, impudently, firm to the promise he had just made to Anne of Austria.
“See, Aramis, as I have told you, D’Artagnan is first amongst us all,” said Athos.
“I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?”
“I cannot stop a moment; I must start for Paris again immediately.”
“Her lover.”
“Monsieur,” he said, after a moment, “they tell me great things of you.
“Help!” she screamed, “my master is being arrested; the Councillor Broussel is being arrested!
And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it.
“D’Artagnan!
“How, madame,” said she, “I have scarcely seen you, and you already wish to deprive me of your company, upon which I had counted a little, I must confess, for the time I have to pass here?”
“Yes, yes, let us fly!” repeated Mme.
As to the left-hand one, he conscientiously repeated the same signals, which were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior.

The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise Chapter 106.
Now, since D’Artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen, since he was alone, since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain, no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way.
The abbé shrugged his shoulders.
“You wish to see Blois again; it is but natural.”
“No,” replied the servants, “it is even probable that we have not been seen; the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us, in the thickest part of the wood, and we returned to ask your advice.”
“What?”
He fixed his eyes upon D’Artagnan even more earnestly than before.
“The London executioner has disappeared, your majesty, but a man has offered his services instead.
The guards looked on it with indifference.
“We will remain in the background,” said Porthos, “and he will advance alone.”
You must have discovered a mine, or else become a stockbroker.”
“You will find that it is as good as another.”
It is the insect with black claws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance.”
“Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and with my knife forced open the lock of the box.
In a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything since the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.
You understand, it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box.
“Yes, my lord.”
The first prince of the blood, the king’s uncle!”
“Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,” said Villefort.
“Ugh!
“Who said so?”
Aramis, who had the third canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.
“Gentlemen,” said the man, who was young and pale, bowing with ease and courtesy, “pardon my curiosity, but I see you come from Paris, or at least that you are strangers at Boulogne.”
His early refinement of character was not only not lost, it grew even greater than ever; but it was now applied to the little, instead of to the great things of life—to the martial condition of the soldier—comprised under the head of a good lodging, a rich table, a congenial hostess.
But be of good cheer; with certain people, everything comes round.”
But where is Franz?”
This is recent news, sir,” continued she, “and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me; without this letter I should not have heard till to-morrow, perhaps after to-morrow—the last of all Paris.”
This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little in the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the great Henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto.
“But what’s the matter, Raoul?” said Athos, very anxiously.
The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it; he only satisfied himself by Milady’s pulse that the case was not serious.
Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company.
He touched him on the shoulder.
A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls, having told him to take it to No.
“The Comte de la Fere, madame,” replied the young man, bowing.
“Bravo!
Do they know him?” asked Château-Renaud.
How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room!
“Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.”
On a sudden she stepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.
Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp.
“And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers?”
“To Auteuil!” cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid—“I go to Auteuil?”
“Important and urgent,” said he.
“Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister’s?” said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he tried to make it remain.
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “you weary me very much, I assure you, with your questions.”
At this word _apologies_, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was the reply of Aramis.
“I want to go into Master Broussel’s house, captain,” replied Friquet, in that wheedling way the “gamins” of Paris know so well how to assume when necessary.
Now, I travel a great deal, particularly on this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune.”
It was three o’clock; at a quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs.
My mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned.
“Fell into the sea?”
“Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.”
I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts.
Well?”
“Revenge yourself, then, Edmond,” cried the poor mother; “but let your vengeance fall on the culprits,—on him, on me, but not on my son!”
“And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I was obliged to pay a hundred——”
Chapter LXXXIV.
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart.
“Do you want me to go away?”
“An Englishman you say?”
But Parry withdrew, thinking he was dreaming.
Now, I entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly.
Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give way a foot.
“Do you wish me to speak the truth?”
Well, I went to a horse dealer’s, where I saw this magnificent horse, which I have named Médéah.
After a moment’s mournful silence, his heart overflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears.
“What did you answer him?”
“From whom is this?” said he eagerly.
Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villefort’s countenance.
“To the smaller.”
“Well?
“What?
It is even probable that I shall have to make a journey.
Arrest the prime minister of King Charles I.!
This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus, who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became secretary of state, and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself.
“My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love even me long.
“How long a start have they?”
“You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,” said the soldier; “but you forgot to leave me the key.
That’s it!
“No; for another.”
He repaired, then, instantly to the office of the _lieutenant-criminel_.
“False!” he muttered.
“Oh, very shortly, madame,” said he; “but I do not precisely recollect the date of the day.
But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois.
The two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were dying with hunger and thirst.
“Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at Tours.”
We shall meet again in better days.”
I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercédès; but for you—in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall find.”
“There, now!
It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting.

I knew the horse he rode; it belonged to the butcher, who lets it out now and then to M. Bazin.
“That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.”
“Olivain, we have come into possession of two horses, but I have lost my own.
“Come here, Monsieur Captain,” said he, “come here, that I may growl at you.
“And thou, my brave fellow, thou consentest thus to aid me?”
“Beware, sir,” replied the president, “you are no longer in the assembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible.” But instead of listening, M. d’Épinay went on,—“You are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one.” The president stopped the coach.
“That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.”
“Yes, count; nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant since.”
“How so?”
“The doctor’s niece?”
“Are you quite impervious to good advice?”
The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench.
Give the watchword.”
On entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.
“Then let us have a match in the tennis court,” exclaimed La Ramee.
“Well,” said the patron, “let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you.
Chapter XIX.
“I do not know particulars.
Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is?”
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression.
The sergeant of this company, a veteran of the Spanish wars, had recognized Porthos, his old companion, and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Tréville.
“Pardon, your majesty,” he cried, “but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors; what are your commands?”
“The battle of Lens gained!” said the queen; “they are lucky here indeed; they can gain battles!
The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.
It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose, was, after all, a good thing.
“I hear,” said Aramis, “but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain.”
“My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and steady.”
“Precisely!” cried Albert.
I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words.
“And now, madame, till I see you again!
By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness.
But it has none.”
It was evident he had his orders.
“I go away enchanted.”
How much do you want?”
“Here I am!” exclaimed Porthos.
For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady.
He then left for Madrid, and was no more heard of.
This advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it.
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “you have been arrested by my orders.”
The jailer advanced; Dantès appeared not to perceive him.
The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.
Aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar, apostrophized them rather sharply.
“Ah!
“You are among friends,” said Athos, in English; “so cheer up, and tell us, if you have the strength to do so, what has happened?”
The mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.”
Aramis whistled for Bazin, but Bazin was asleep in the ante-chamber, and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him.
You think me rather parsimonious, don’t you?
“Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson & French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.”
The next day, in fact, at daybreak, the court made preparations to quit Saint Germain.
That devil, Porthos, is a man of prodigious strength; still, if Athos joins us, well, we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis, that little coxcomb with his too good luck.”
She is young; she is beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions.
Everyone had just seen it pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in advance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend.
“’Tis done!” they both exclaimed at once.
The matter is gallant.
You will be well fed there, if the hostess remains the same.
Not an instant to be lost!
Chapter LXVIII.
“Have you any letters for me?” inquired D’Artagnan, wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief.
“‘On the cross,’ cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had recovered all my strength, ‘on the cross I swear that no promise, no menace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth!
When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the gold-headed cane which he held in his hand.
“I see,” answered Dantès.
A considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord.
The patron of _La Jeune Amélie_ proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category.
A double line of carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet.
The queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.
“Gaetano,” said he to the captain, “you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very different kind of game from the goats.”
The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands, and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way.
“Till tomorrow, then,” said Aramis; “for iron-nerved as you are, you must need repose.”
I have seen that, mother; I know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors, and have punished them.
“No,” she replied, “it is for my poor grandmother.
“Here,” said he, “is a proof of my satisfaction.”
He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman entered, and approaching Milady’s bed, offered her services.
“Why so?”
“Left?—M.
On the contrary, when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike.
“Oh, father!” said she, clasping her hands, “forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings.”
It was no longer the same man—the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him.
At thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or England.
“Most undoubtedly.
“What can I do for you, Valentine?”
That is to say, Athos will be chief engineer, Porthos purveyor-in-general, and Aramis governor of the fortress.”
“It is as I tell you.”
These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder intonation.
“What, my good fellow!” replied Athos, “wait awhile; we have scarcely left him two hours ago—he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are.
A friend, a wife, a daughter, have done us the honor to call us to their aid.
“Delighted with you, was he not?
“Yes, yes, everything for him.
The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption; but at Crèvecœur, Aramis declared he could proceed no farther.
“Well, would you believe it?
He was called Benedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his parents.”
“Well,” said the queen, “it has been refused.”
“Be it so then,” replied Athos, sorrowfully.
“Well,” said Athos, when Aramis and he were in the boat again, “are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin?”
“I can hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess my faith.
“I don’t understand,” said Porthos.
The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom.
He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count’s box at the Argentina and Valle theatres.

“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “you did not really wish to kill; you only wished to imprison him.”
“I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation; but you did not come.
Well, then, believe me, Athos, your mission is ended, and ended nobly; return to France with us.”
I have seen so many remarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I think, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron’s heroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some Lara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient family, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws of society.”
That gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life.”
Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St. Denis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to whom D’Artagnan had often remarked this.
But how, unless a miracle should restore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained to that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?” A smile lit up the old man’s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face.
“Does he still live?” inquired the innkeeper.
Shall you never leave me again?
Did I tell you that I wouldn’t serve any other?
The inquiries soon commenced.
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, “it is useless to struggle longer.

I will introduce you to them.”
“Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa.
I feel cramps over my whole body.”
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!”
He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence.
“Ah,” asked the countess, “who is out in the streets of Rome at this hour, unless it be to go to a ball?”
This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was, for the moment, restrained by a more muscular hand than his own, and that the restraint could not be easily broken through.
“I wish what God wills.”
“But who said it was buried alive?”
“They don’t yet know, sir, on account of the swelling; but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured.”
It was situated in a very private spot.
“Undoubtedly.”
I shall, therefore, not visit either of these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find a good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work.”
Here is an order for two hundred pistoles; call upon my treasurer and get the money.
Porthos devoured D’Artagnan with wondering eyes.
“Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?” inquired Eugénie.
“Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but——”
“Pardon, monsieur; pity!
“But in his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it afterwards.”
“Alas, sir,” said Monte Cristo “this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought.
“A lion even?”
They were only fit for a young man.”
“Monsieur,” said Aramis, parodying Jussac, “it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves; but unfortunately the thing is impossible—Monsieur de Tréville has forbidden it.
He stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation.
“Ah,” exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, “you had only lost your liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost Valentine.”
“He replied—he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must be attributed”—
But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugénie; for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France.”
“No; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?”
It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for.
Why the devil, then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?”
“Sire,” replied Richelieu, “rest assured that Particelli, the man to whom your majesty refers, has been hanged.”
“Well, what is the matter?” asked the young lieutenant.
Then, having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own, he glanced towards the door.
“And with my grandfather’s consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made you.”
“You must give your recipe to Planchet.
And he signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors.
At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder.
These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were, and on the other into a large square chamber, entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken.
I don’t like Mazarin any better than you do.
Porthos, however, found that he had no straw left for himself.
“With monsieur.”
“At the appointed hour I shall be ready; only I believed that Monsieur had but one horse in the Guard stables.”
D’Artagnan unfolded the paper.
“We are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof.
This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count.
What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart?—only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a woman of fifty.
“Your pardon, my officer,” said Athos; “but we were ignorant with whom we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard.”
“In business, sir,” said he, “one has no friends, only correspondents.”
“And suppose you cannot pass through them?”
“They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought to reap a little blue.”
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling, casting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me.
“Good.”
He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same way he came, re-entered the hôtel, and went to his apartment.
A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance, which was not natural to him.
“What is going on, my lord?
“By him we obey.”
“He did.”
“Oh, pray, for mercy’s sake, don’t fly from me.
“Well, I will give it up, then,” said the young woman, sighing.
“Yes.”
Half past seven had sounded.
“Now to the point.
“Your eminence might be recognized.”
Mercédès might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent.
“To Monsieur de Chanleu, who commands your troops at Charenton.
“No, I have given up poetry, except now and then to write a drinking song, some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram; I compose sermons, my friend.”
“My child,” cried Villefort, “he carries away the body of my child!
“Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
When landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at Boulogne, after a two days’ passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.
“But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,—why picture so gloomy a future?”
“He is here.”

oh!” said Porthos, “there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me, D’Artagnan.”
“Was it not his betrothal feast?”
Two large slabs of marble, on which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees.
A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about to break in upon the abbé’s speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said, “Allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to make, you can do so afterwards.
de Guise?
“Well,” said Milady, “I have not seen our Gascon this evening.”
“Who, then, has so correctly informed you?” asked he; “for my paper, which gave the first information on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf, as he is a peer of France, and we are of the opposition.”
“Well?” said Athos.
And as he said this, the “eye severe” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance.
It could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as we have said, rendered still darker.
That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation.
“Oh,” said Andrea, “my father’s old servant.
At the moment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor, followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Milady.
The following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel, accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantès, residing in the Allées de Meilhan, and also a young woman called Mercédès, an inhabitant of the Catalan village.
“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.
“Oh, reverend sir!”
See the fatal example: on the Vendomois road, D’Artagnan, you so brave, and you, Porthos, so valiant and so strong—you were beaten; to-day Aramis and I are beaten in our turn.
In fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city.
You, whom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was half-past!
Many observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room.
“Yes, if you really wish it,” said D’Artagnan, “and even with great pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.”
He was now a lieutenant.
“But are you not still in the service—you, D’Artagnan?”
“Give me your word, gentlemen, that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other.”
“Yes.”
They are quite new, and have not yet been used.
“25th April, 1498.
Scarcely had the count’s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, when Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter—much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural.
“I told you he was not at home,” repeated the valet.
I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty.
“It is, in truth, monsieur le coadjuteur’s carriage,” said D’Artagnan; “upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us.”
the count!” cried a young voice that made Athos start.
The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore, requesting an interview, which the latter had fixed for ten o’clock.
“And I know he has fought two duels,” said Morrel.
He was certainly eating, and noisily too, like an ill-bred man.
They breakfasted with a good appetite, looking now and then at poor Raoul, who with moist eyes and a full heart, scarcely ate at all.
“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium.
“Well,” said he, “let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to everyone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them.”
When I first came here; being the last comer, it was for me to make the first advances.
“Thanks, my worthy friend.
The carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car.
“In the regiment,” said D’Artagnan, “he is called Porthos” (the queen started), “but his true name is the Chevalier du Vallon.”
Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame Bonacieux was released.
“The great man has called me his friend!”
“You did not let the executioner escape, then?”
“We will accept them the more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan, at Marseilles.
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Tréville, who was returning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers.
“Ah,” said Morrel.
“Listen.
The Law Chapter 100.
The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen.
“Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me—a paralysis, I think.”
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she controlled herself.
“Only that?” said Mazarin, his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthos’s devotion without opening his purse; “only that?
Athos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with D’Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first effort he made, although he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion.
“’Tis true, my lord,” answered La Ramee, “that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent.”
He again took in his strong arms the little girl, whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder, and placed her gently in the carriage; then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first-rate esquire, after bowing to Athos and D’Artagnan, he went off close by the door of the carriage, on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted.
Oh, Valentine, you who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him answer—Soon.”
At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second he reminded her that he loved her.
Bring it to me—or rather—no, no!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along.
The young man’s finger, glided over the words, but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign.
“And he said nothing as he died?”
The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain, was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone.
You have hastened to me—can I have the happiness of being useful to you?”
“And I reply to you, sir, that this abuse of power, this exile under a fictitious name, are infamous!”
“Then I must give up the idea?”
“It is the first time he has ever been in Paris.
Dantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past.
“As a punishment for the crime I had committed,” answered Bertuccio.
“The Count of Monte Cristo?”
“I understand,” he said, “you confess; but a confession made to the judges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime cannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty!”
“And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile.”
What was most pressing was to get Mme.
As to Mme.
“Can you not tell me his name?”
Indeed, I expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack.
And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the Cavalcanti!”
“It is well,” replied Mercédès, with her eloquent glance; “you are right, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion.”
It was a very simple, natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation.
At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request.

“Yes, but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind; he has a lieutenant, and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt.”
“That last order is useless,” interrupted D’Artagnan; “there are loaded pistols in your holsters.”
“I shall never forget it,” replied D’Artagnan.
tell me—where?”
“But you will not follow me; you will not watch me?”
“Chevalier,” he said, “get up and don’t make the least noise.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the coachman.
Dantès smiled.
If they catch thee, thou wilt be hung.”
“No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company.”
Two hours later, thirty officiating ministers from the most populous, and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled there.
I invite you with good-will.’
Twenty Years After
“Well, then,” continued Emmanuel, “we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house.”
Morrel could not resist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily impressed, but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before him, was more than he could bear in silence.
Do you know Monsieur de Tréville, their captain?”
I see it and I thank you for it.
“That’s true,” murmured the commissary; “_pardieu_, that’s true.”
I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.”
“It is the usual block,” answered the man in the mask.
Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own sailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance.
“When you please, monsieur,” said Athos, putting himself on guard.
“Monsieur,” said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, “do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of Elba?
Is that all, then?”
“Alas, yes!” said Caderousse very uneasily.
“But you will not make me your confidant, Maximilian?” said the count, in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret.
The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king, queen, and cardinal, all three together.
At midnight they withdrew to their chamber, the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration.
“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of police, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination.
Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow, and was soon trotting by his side.
“Yes, you.”
On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed, and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care.
“Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges?”
He went direct to the Bedford Tavern, and the host, who recognized him, was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company.
“You know the proverb ‘Unlucky at play, lucky in love.’ You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge.
“Observe, it is probable that I may not be able to remain here.”
In short, you will find your father a very presentable person, I assure you.”
Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”
“What do you say, monsieur?” cried the cardinal, astonished; “and of what woman are you speaking thus?”
“Yes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it.
“Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother’s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that quarter, I assure you.”
“Have you been, or are you, his mistress?”
“Yes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth.”
“I like to hear him talk,” said Athos; “his dialect amuses me.”
“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo, sighing.
Well, do you understand, monsieur?
“Well, my dear Aramis, you don’t want three horses?
“How old are you?
“Did he come to arrest me?”
Mazarin took the letter and read it thus:
“I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my evidence.”
Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, “To the Chamber of Deputies.”
Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso, and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, that’s my point for sport.
“Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence?” cried Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; “have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?”
“Yes,” said the count, “yes.”
“’Tis this: when we escape together, that I shall go everywhere and be always first; for if my lord should be overtaken and caught, there’s every chance of his being brought back to prison, whereas if I am caught the least that can befall me is to be—hung.”
Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond.
“You would, then, be tempted to believe,” said the abbess, “that this young person is innocent?”
“Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.” The soldiers seized Dantès, who followed passively.
But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum.”
“Indeed?” said Athos.
Thus, the greater number of a man’s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then, after error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of delirium, or of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it.
“Ah!
“Yes,” said Porthos, recollecting himself, “but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two.”
“Nothing!” replied Grimaud.
“Yes, Tréville, yes,” said the king, in a melancholy tone; “and it is very sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to royalty.
“Well?” asked the duke when they were alone.
“Well, what is this island?”
More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory.
30.”
The house, with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and picturesque, and was the same that old Dantès formerly inhabited—the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret, while the whole house was now placed at the command of Mercédès by the count.
“_Ma foi!_ monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.”
But Porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant, and when Mousqueton rose above the water, blind as a new-born puppy, he found he was supported by the large hand of Porthos and that he was thus enabled, without having occasion even to move, to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton.
Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on.
It was Mousqueton.
Mordaunt followed Bernouin, who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper, showing him the way out.
Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius, as I thought, he is a man of no origin—once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio, and he got on by intrigue.
“Prince Cavalcanti,” said Danglars, who persisted in giving the young man that title.
“Your name?” replied the commissary.
That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini’s rear when he fell.
I respect your convictions, and whilst we fight for opposite sides, let us remain friends.
However, among all the incoherent details given to me by the Abbé Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that enemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion—that in no period, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any contact between him and me.”
“Oh, what do I not owe you, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan.
“Aha!”
She stopped astonished, then the voice reached her ear more distinctly, and she recognized it to be that of Maximilian.
Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very dangerous.”
“No, sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “besides, has she not——”
Do you wish these proofs, these attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed?
If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have been constrained to pity him.
“You accept my proposal?”
“And people are wrong, D’Artagnan; for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation.”
“Come.”
Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved a deep sigh.
A fortnight afterward the duke, going to the tennis court, found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside; he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day.
Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them.
“A letter?”
“In an hour you shall be obeyed.”
Go to England, join the king, be his friends, protectors, march to battle at his side, and be near him in his house, where conspiracies, more dangerous than the perils of war, are hatching every day.
“Well, I will have Franz and Château-Renaud; they will be the very men for it.”
“For Peppino!” cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged.
Adieu, gentlemen!”
You have seduced this young girl; you have outraged, defiled her.
“With two companions, yes,” replied the duke.
They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur, at the counter—as their friends must have done before them.
Noirtier made no answer.
My father died, but I did not die.
“The lieutenant of musketeers?” asked Gondy.
In brief, how much remains?”
Encouraged by this invitation, D’Artagnan followed the duke, who closed the door after them.
After continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man suddenly exclaimed, “I have found what you were in search of!”
Adieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.”
“Oh, sir,” exclaimed the baroness, “you are without pity for others, well, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!”
Read and answer, or I will blow out your brains!”
“What do you mean?” asked Valentine.
“Ah, faith!
“In Strafford’s company,” said Mordaunt, tauntingly.
I must return to the minister’s.
“Listen,” continued the abbé.
“And with whom?”
Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.” The general, again daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then advancing to the president’s desk,—“What is the form, said he.
At these words she passed her arm under that of D’Artagnan, and urged him forward eagerly.
You are not willing that I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul.”
Voices, unheard except on days of revolution, were distinguished; faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed.
Edmond, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart.
If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.
“They are sinking!” cried Olivain in his turn.
That nobleman was you; it was his father!”
Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown.
“So you defend him!
“Oh!
“It is useless; he would not come up.”
“Are you a politician, friend?”
The king, half dressed, the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place, where they were listening and waiting.
“‘Whose name is——’
I neither reproach you nor hate you, my friend.
Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles, I cannot see much that is left unless they eat one another.”
The pistol fell from his hands.
“I believe I know M. Franz d’Épinay,” said the count; “is he not the son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d’Épinay by Charles X.?”
They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we shall be out of the range of their balls.
“What, he had done you the honor to remain here?”
Now after what you told me this morning of your heart, I may believe——”
In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king’s closet opened, and M. de Tréville saw M. de la Trémouille come out.
Chapter LXXXIII.
“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.
When I perceived you, I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the proverb of ‘He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself.’ Well, on my word of honor, I answered, ‘No!’ I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud, perhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all have our faults.
Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.
“And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.”
To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor.
The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests.
Julie returned, holding the silken purse in her hands, while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks, like dewdrops on the rose.
“It is my intention so to do; come, let us hear you.
After having stood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp, Dantès’ eye, habituated as it was to darkness, could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds.
“This block is very low, is there no other to be had?”
“Everyone is free to ask what he pleases.”
He criticised everybody humorously.
“How so?”
It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury.
The sentinel who was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him.
“Then let us draw on the spot.
His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villefort’s life; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club.
“The usurper’s conversion!” murmured the duke, looking at the king and Dandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil’s shepherds.
“I have also sent for the procureur.”
“You remind me,” said the priest, “that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.”
Albert’s lips scarcely whispered “Good-bye,” but his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger, proud disdain, and generous indignation.
During our expedition to Béthune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me, I shall marry the widow.
“Do you know the Mediterranean?”
“It happens well that we are going there this evening,” said Athos to the vicomte; “we will pay our compliments to that poor man.”
“Yes, hell has resuscitated you,” continued Athos.
“Upon my word,” cried the old man, “you make short work of this kind of affair.
He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud.
“Do you understand it?”
“Be at ease, Felton,” said Lord de Winter.
“You come from the queen?” said Mazarin, looking fixedly at D’Artagnan.
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.
“How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer.
“You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.
50215m
The count understood him.
At the door the count was met by the two notaries, who had just completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine, and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit.
He must have been dreadfully hurt, for he did not stir from the place where he fell.
“How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity?”
He was naked, with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge-hammer.
So we will take leave of our friend, and let him hasten home.”
‘Oh!’ said I to him.
You may understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the Church.”
Héloïse de Villefort.
“Ground arms,” exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand, while with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, “Your pardon, your excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit, that I did not really recognize you.”
“But if your honor knew this man?”
“The cardinal,” interrupted Mazarin, “was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me.
“For long?”
Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock, half open, afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales.
You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband, have you?”
“Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées, and at ten o’clock I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me?”
“My friend,” said Athos, “I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary.”
“Never mind, never mind!” resumed the cardinal, with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.
“You played very willingly with us without knowing our names,” said Athos, “by the same token that you won our horses.”
“He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my poor father.
“My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I entreat you.”
“Where are we going?” asked he, by a gesture.
But he will not avow it.”
‘Hush, child!’ said she.
“The year 1829,” returned Jacopo.
“Did they speak of me?”
“Tell me his name.”
Bonacieux.
“M.
“That will do; I will be there.”
“My Lord,” cried the queen, “you forget that I have never said that I love you.”
“Oh,” cried the inspector, “who can live here?”
“You are right, my lord duke,” answered the officer; “I don’t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table; and when, added to that, he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV., you will, my lord duke, easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys.”
“Is regarded with universal esteem.”
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers, Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel’s family and the sailors at the door.
“Hold your tongue,” said he, “and let me answer.
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray.
“Yes.
“You leave me, then?”
“He sent us word this morning,” replied Château-Renaud, “that he would meet us on the ground.”
Why, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for each other.”
“I do not think so.”
Is it from mere humanity you bid me live?
Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees, had thrown himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing Emmanuel’s hand significantly, “Watch over him.”
“However, sir,” said the stranger, “he has neither fled nor is in prison?”
“Have you confidence in me?”
“Oh, ay!
“That may be, my lord; but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister, he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your offer.”
Penelon put his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain.
“To whom?”
Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community?
There only remains, then, the question of the five shillings to be settled.
What will Monsieur de Tréville say?
I’ve remarked that your Puritans revel in that color.”
“True,” he replied, “and my protector is very kind.”
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given, D’Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook the carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had disappeared.
Before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived.
“What an appetite you used to have!
“This humble picture would have but little interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have experienced bitter sorrows.”
Now, really, let me ask, sir, have you?—do you believe you have anything to do?
“The truth, my dear count.
Felton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward expression of agony.
Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart!”
Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques; as to M. Baptistin, this portion of the building was interdicted to him.
It was, however, merely a letter of introduction.
However flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use in ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different modulations.
“Hush!” said Porthos; “listen.”)
“Proceed,” said Monte Cristo.
“Yes, my lord.”
She opened the door.
“Well, beautiful lady, very well,” said he; “but, _pardieu_, if you don’t calm yourself, I will design a second _fleur-de-lis_ upon one of those pretty cheeks!”
The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water.
Pardon you, monseigneur!
“Gentlemen,” said De Winter, on reaching the gate of the town, “let us do here as at Paris—let us separate to avoid suspicion.
“Excessively; only imagine—but do tell me, viscount, whether you really are acquainted with it or no?”
as we used to say when we said good-bye to each other in the late cardinal’s time.”
“To be sure he does.
“Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all made some noise in the world, were quite behind him.”
“No one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself.
Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his head and repeating, “I shall follow up on my idea.”
Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.
“Take care, madame,” said Athos, “for he knows neither his father nor his mother.”
Bonacieux wept all day, like a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself informed us.
sir!
Chapter 101.
With a word, D’Artagnan reassured them; and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.
“I wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of absence for fifteen days.”
Chapter XXXVII.
The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney.
“What must be done then?” asked the general.—“I have my carriage here,” said the president.
“Look there,” said Maximilian, laughing; “there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat.
My dear count, you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed.
A woman, and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex, I am alarmed at the idea of civil war; a queen, accustomed to be obeyed, I am excited at the first opposition.”
Are they made to order?”
“Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society, or two words from your lips?
“Good, very good,” said Porthos; “that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron.”
“It is I who cherish no resentment.”
I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man.
“Monsieur de Scudery, the author of ‘Clelie,’ and of ‘Le Grand Cyrus,’ which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister, who is now talking to that pretty person yonder, near Monsieur Scarron.”
“Hôtel of the Guards, company of Dessessart.”
“I have provided for everything; a carriage below is waiting for your majesty.”
“The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined for plotting with the Bonapartists.”
Aramis affected a laugh, to divert the attention of certain curious listeners, and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there, he proceeded to join him, throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room.
“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass; but if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”
The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots.
“Sir,” cried she, “be kind, be clement, listen to my prayer!
He waited, then, in the ante-chamber with impatience, till he should be conducted to them.
“Pity Albert also, Maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess.
At this moment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet, which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose.
Have you decided?” said she.
“Well, if you are really afraid, Monsieur Planchet,” resumed D’Artagnan, “I will go without you.
Why, diamonds—and she is covered with them.”
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.
“What man?” said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected.
What wages are due to you?”
The lookout has signalled her, and they say she is now coming into port.”
“In that case, adieu.”
At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.
“I have them at hand, monsieur.”
But I too have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has come over me; but I have always given it up.
“The former executioner of Bethune!” murmured the young monk, shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired.
“And what is this cause?” demanded Aramis.
“I do not go on because it pleases me to stop here.”
D’Artagnan answered, with the greatest simplicity: “I came to Paris with exactly such intentions.
Dantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service—a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.
Ah, I had eighty louis before me; put down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of.
Then, with a sigh, “Poor Haydée!” murmured he.
“Thanks, my lord, I will speak to him myself.
“Where are you taking me?” he asked.
Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh, the appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung—which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of Beaugency—produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.
This idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance.
And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window, which was broken by the explosion.
Chapter 55.
Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine.
“And if you catch up with them you won’t come back to hang me,” murmured the sergeant.
We are now on the sea, at night, without any pilot, in a frail bark; should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost.”
At ten o’clock Felton came and placed the sentinel.
“Because, I suppose, it is his nature to do so, for the love of robbing.”
“It does,” replied the abbé; “with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès, which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors.”
“Stop, I want to remember his exact words.
“Ah, indeed!
“He is wandering about the environs of the castle,” thought D’Artagnan.
“And M. de Beaufort—is he still in prison?”
“She has never been so kind before.
He motioned to Valentine to approach.
D’Artagnan was perplexed.
Do you wish for any further details?
However, for my part, I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor.
“To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarin’s hands that famous diamond—you remember all about it—that I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which, I don’t know how, she has regained possession.”
“Come, step in,” said the young man.
“My lord, there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe, and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you.”
The unknown spurred his horse to a gallop.
It was then that he saw a horseman, as it were, detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance.
They had not yet begun to slay, but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting.
Him I can place at your disposal; it is Count de Rochefort.”
Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such an effect?”
They then went down to the Thames.
Are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the Guards, at court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or the Three Inseparables?
“But wherefore are you here?”
Although I was without mistrust, a vague fear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness.
At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.
They want food already.
More dead than alive, he looked around him.
Dantès instantly turned to meet him.
Accept my compliments; your dinner has been a real feast.
The Story
Debray smiled.
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am here.”
D’Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace, but it was not so.
Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire.
“Have you any suspicion of me, Rochefort?”
As for the queen, furious, and left to her own guidance, she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry.
The epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom of D’Artagnan’s heart.
“Money, my lord, as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require.
“Six millions!” gasped Danglars—“so be it.”
Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of Anne of Austria.
“Why, you are like No.
“Oh, yes, him!
Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face, and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch’s blood, fell down insensible.
“That, too, is impossible.”
“It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantès was arrested.”
Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king.
“Never,” answered De Guiche.
Comminges saw that he was undecided.
Cries of despair resounded on all sides.
“What particulars would your excellency like to hear?”
“Because you do not love me, madame!
“Very well, indeed, sir,” replied Comminges; “at first, like you, he seemed distressed; but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening——”
“But I thought,” he said, “that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one——”
“There’s one just arrived,” and she handed the letter to D’Artagnan.
Now, at the moment when I left his house—”
“They have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the Palais Royal!” exclaimed Mazarin.
Danglars’ feelings were hurt, and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word.
“A rope ladder.”
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “do not let us lose our time in jesting.
50113m
The duke, in order to pass away another quarter of an hour, pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter.
“You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de Villefort and Valentine at the same time.
“You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier d’Humieres has promised me whenever I need them.”
In a week, remember, you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice, but on a field of battle.”
“What does the animal say?” asked the duke.
“But do you understand?”
The steward attempted to expostulate.
“Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.”
He had made some difficulties about going, under pretext that he still suffered from his wound, but D’Artagnan had said to him:
That’s a frightful place, that Bastille!
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “she is alone within half a league of us, in the direction of the river.”
I forgot to ask you—where are you taking me?”
The rumor of Edmond’s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city.
I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has said.
_Morbleu!_ You must know something about it.
Now in the army, from the division-generals who desire the death of the general-in-chief, to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals, all desire some one’s death.
“Well,” thought D’Artagnan, “poor Athos is perhaps at this moment dead, and dead by my fault—for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of which he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the result, and from which he can derive no advantage.”
As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing.
First one gun’l goes under, then the other.
“Oh, _pardieu_, less than nothing,” said Aramis; “a charming little seamstress, whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake.”
“Fire!” cried Grimaud, unconsciously.
He was punctual, dressed in black, with crape around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin’s with a face made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be required.
“A thousand things.
D’Artagnan and Athos laughed aloud.
M. de Villefort would stifle the affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea to fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court.
“We say, ‘Proud as a Scotsman,’” murmured the Duke of Buckingham.
“Oh, it is all my wife’s fault.
Ah, my head!—Oh, what agony!—Shall I suffer like this long?”
“He is with Edward, who is not quite well,” replied Madame de Villefort, no longer being able to avoid answering.
Some of the men moved toward them.
The crowd gave place, the barricade was opened, and the marshal, with the remnant of his company, retreated, preceded by Friquet and his bandits, some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet.
“Did he name no one in his passion?”
“Who goes there?” cried the same voice, impatiently whilst D’Artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses’ heads.
“You are an intelligent fellow, my friend; can we count upon you?”
The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénie’s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as Château-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute.
The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity, of which Morcerf had formed no previous idea.
When he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning; and the members of the group, whether rebels or not, as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal, at once gave place to the patrol.
However ill the king might sleep, M. de Tréville slept still worse.
Each was accompanied by two priests.
“Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do well.”
“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino.
Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or dressing-case.”
Albert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more attention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend.
I learn this desire, or rather I suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing, I send one of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at his orders, and he brings you hither to this castle, of which I am governor, whither I come every day, and where, in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other, I have prepared you a chamber.
The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance; and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to him.
I have promised to escort to the Académie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.”
The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him; Baptistin, who rode in front, attended the count.
Mme.
Let us act in freedom, that we may act well and quickly.”
“Egad!
Now, how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter?”
“‘Are you mad, uncle?’ (he called me by this name when he was in good humor); ‘do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode of existence—my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and the scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you are perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum?
“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful _cicerone_.
“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us.”
“How is it concealed?”
If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on Valentine.
The house, with kitchens and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and attics.
“Oh, Heaven!”
The young officer stood upright before her, awaiting her words as if to devour them.
Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed; and it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort, that she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather Benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him.
“No, sing it, please.”
“To nobody in the world.”
“I did!”
He was incessantly attacked by them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this misfortune, wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them, had advised him, in order to conjure away the tempting demon, to have recourse to the bell rope, and ring with all his might.
“Because if, as you say, Athos and Aramis are in real danger, this is not the time to abandon them.
“No jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,” said Porthos; “thank God the queen is still of an age to give one!”
“Where shall I find the governor?”
“The count has only been two or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.”

There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows.”
Noirtier had once made a will against you—against your family—in favor of the poor, in fact; M. Noirtier is spared, because nothing is expected from him.
The man he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening, leading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse, not such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death.
As captain of the Musketeers, M. de Tréville had the right of entry at all times.
“Command, sir.”
“Not to be found!” cried Athos.
But send me word should you be arrested, for then I will return directly.”
“Still the hand of God.”
“How, sire?” cried the young queen, affecting surprise, “you are giving me, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.”
“In four days,” said Morrel; “it is extraordinary!”
“_Ma foi_, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count’s eloquence decides me.”
woe is me!
A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos: “If Athos knows where we are, if he opens communication with us, before long Athos will act.”
The ass!
Oh, yes, sir, you are right—it is fatality!”
“Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings, so fraught with danger to both.”
Anne was caught, she could not draw back—she signed; but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep.
“Well, then, why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man?”
The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it, before they had time to cock their muskets.
The love I have for you is very different from the love I had for my father.
The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings.
“‘I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,’ said Luigi proudly.
Ridicule, sir—why, you know not its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!”
A sob was the only sound he heard.
“And at the third she expired.”
“It is enough,” said Athos, bowing low, “if the lives of three men can purchase yours, madame.”
“Here is,” said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his pocket, “an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due.
Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.
And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona.
But will you not go up?”
“Alas!
Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs.
The affair was not long, I assure you.
“Laugh, if you will; the Countess G——, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared that the count was a vampire.”
La Ramee came into the room.
“Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers——”
“Sir, I shall call my people.”
The Lions’ Den Chapter 108.
I will call on you, sir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family.”
sir!” said Raoul, “allow me, after thanking you for that poor fellow’s life, to thank you on my own account.
“Really!
At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards.
“Oh, no; it is useless.
My ship is ready, and had you not come I must have set off without you, for General Cromwell expects my return impatiently.”
The sight is hideous.”
The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it—all this with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.”
It is pleasant to have such well-dressed brethren; and those gendarmes behaved shamefully.
One of Marie Michon’s Adventures.
“Silence,” said Monte Cristo; “he does not wish you to know that it comes from him.”
“It is possible,” said Morcerf; “my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made commentaries that would have greatly edified d’Hozier and Jaucourt.
“What!”
“I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation.”
“You see it makes a very respectable appearance.”
Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us?
Vampa took this wild road, which, enclosed between two ridges, and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the difficulties of its descent, that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks.
Chapter XLV.
“In the pavilion of the orangery, of course, in front of the pavilion where the guard is.
“Yes—why?” asked La Ramee.
“Good, _the Luxembourg!_ One might believe this is an allusion to the queen-mother!
We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray.
“What a cold wind!” resumed Athos; “a wintry blast.
“See!” answered the voice.
“And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents?” asked Debray.
“Yes, count, and a splendid duel, too; a duel in which I hope you will take your part.”
In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o’clock she was at the fort of the Point; at eight o’clock she had embarked; and at nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its course toward England.
“Did you fancy yourself dying?”
“Yes, since you have such a good memory.”
I admire, I love him—for I know his former adventures—but I shall not speak to him until the day after to-morrow.”
“Do you know his abode?”
“‘And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.’”
A gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated at the same table, and was breakfasting.
This time the marshal charged, but he was welcomed by musket shots, while stones fell like hail from all the windows.
“You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal.
40054m
Do we breakfast or dine?
“Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.”
That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought.
But look!
Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then, taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously awaited the result.
It only remained to put it to the vote, when the president resumed: ‘Gentlemen and you, monsieur,—you will not be displeased, I presume, to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness, and who has just presented himself.
D’Artagnan was worn out with fatigue.
“And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?”
“Halt!” he cried, “this time we shall be pursued.
Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes, he bent his head and wept.
“What do you want, sir?” asked the driver.
If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile; if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Greve.”
I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name of your true executioner.
“I am at your service, and still more my servants.”
“Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”
I fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence.”
“‘Come in, dear M. Joannes.’
There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more.
do you come from the end of the world?” said Monte Cristo; “you, a journalist, the husband of renown?
“Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I told you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject; enlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.”
Athos’s idea!” cried Aramis and D’Artagnan, at the same time.
“Yes,” cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances, “yes, that’s it.
In this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night, while M. de Tréville, in his office contiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to complaints, gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the Louvre, had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms.
“Monsieur is full of generosity,” said Athos.
“Vaguely; I was far from France at that period.
“Eh, egad, to give up Broussel as they demand!
Did not the messenger say your father’s safety depended upon it?”
“Go, Grimaud,” said Athos.
“No.”
Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?”
“What can you expect?” replied Aramis, in a tone of resignation.
“If the poor lad were living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not hesitate.
During the twenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the time.”
He rushed headlong to the street, and like the Greek from Marathon who fell in the square at Athens, with his laurel in his hand, Friquet reached Councillor Broussel’s threshold, and then fell exhausted, scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag.
Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.”
What the devil!
He approached the hole he had dug, and now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood.
Women say those things, but never do them.”
At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered.
The three friends looked on, panting and astonished.
“A ninny, indeed!” said Porthos; “but is the matter certain?”
The count breathed with difficulty; the cold drops ran down his forehead, and his heart was full of anguish.
He passed on to another—it, also, was empty, but the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it gave out, evidently full.
“Alas,” said D’Artagnan, “it is because I am the most unfortunate.”
“Certainly.”
Long life to the great cardinal!” The cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and then, when Bonacieux’s cries were no longer audible, “Good!” said he, “that man would henceforward lay down his life for me.” And the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La Rochelle, which, as we have said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen months later, shut up the port of the besieged city.
“Monsieur the Comte de la Fere,” he cried, “I supplicate you!
Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling, with his arms crossed over his breast.
“Can I be of service to your Majesty?” said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity.
I fear lest Athos should have been beaten down by serving men.
“And Aramis,” said the duchess, quickly.
It is incredible!
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by Laporte.
Wasn’t I right to part with the horses?”
“But you will see him, then?”
He turned and saw a young woman, who made him a sign to follow her.
“My dear friend,” here Athos spoke, “rest assured, if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport.
“Felton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me!
“In the meantime,” said Tréville, “seek him not—if I have a right to advise you.”
Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt.
Maximilian—Emmanuel—if we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!”
Fortune is precarious; and if I were a woman and fate had made me a banker’s wife, whatever might be my confidence in my husband’s good fortune, still in speculation you know there is great risk.
I bought my experience dearly—particularly fair women.
“It is humiliating,” said he, “thus to receive money given grudgingly,—an uncertain supply which may soon fail.
Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him.
“Monsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left; only I beg Monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long.”
Why, I did not expect to see you before tomorrow.”
“Oh, don’t worry about me, Sir Mocker,” said Danglars; then turning to Monte Cristo he said:
“A nice acquaintance, my friend!”
Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind.
Beware!
“Dust I am, and to dust I return.
At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets.
I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively; that it seems as if I had always known you, and always hated you; and, in short, since the young people of the present day will not fight, it remains for us to do so.
My friends will be there, I hope; that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.”
He called for D’Artagnan, but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him, D’Artagnan not being on service.
A second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing through it, made the napkin really a flag.
The abbé opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an effort at self-control, he said, “And Mercédès—they tell me that she has disappeared?”
Independently of every selfish wish, his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor, which recalled to him a good and brave man.
The two friends were perfectly stupefied.
On perceiving Athos, Aramis advanced toward him, took him by the hand and presented him to Scarron.
Let me see: with regard to Porthos, I received a letter from him, too.
why, you strike like a blind or a deaf man.”
Gracious heavens; another idea presents itself—what if they should be——”
“No, but reasonably hideous.”
It was one of the results of Mazarin’s niggardliness.
Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off at a rapid pace.
“Well, let my God save me, or let me perish for my God!
“Is it not enough?
Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating heart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet no one to be seen.
While D’Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors, Aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home D’Artagnan found the reunion complete.
“Where, then, are you going?” asked the marquise.
Ah, good heaven!
Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot, in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match.
It was cowardly, I confess, but it was not criminal.”
“I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else.”
Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwell’s permission.
“Sir,” he said, “you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime.”
“I believe they do.
“What are they?”
I am willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others.”
“Yes,” said Porthos, “we have Mousqueton, but since he has been steward, he has become very heavy; never mind, let us call him, and to make sure that he will reply agreeably——
“In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client.
When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo; thrice, for my steward,—thus I do not waste a minute or a word.
“Where are you going, marechal?” asked the queen.
Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats, which he had utterly forgotten.
Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes’ discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes the fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land.
The clock striking eight awoke her.
“Yes.”
She is amiable and well-behaved.”
“A gentleman!” exclaimed Athos.

At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat.
“I am thinking, madame, of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman, whom you have caused to be arrested, to the Duke of Buckingham—to him whom you allowed to be assassinated—to the Duchess de Chevreuse, whom you suffered to be exiled—to the Duc de Beaufort, whom you imprisoned; but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which I stand to you.”
Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close, then M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs.

“To join the army, under the prince, count.”
“Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be killed?
“Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know these pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient.”

“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”
“Ah!
“But he is dead; I am sure of it.”
Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering.
“What were you doing on that armchair?” asked he.
“Ah, my poor D’Artagnan!” said Athos.
“None.”
I have heard that name in Greece.”
Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it.”

“Remorse!
Meanwhile, Villefort and d’Avrigny had made all possible haste, Valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold.
Mercédès was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no, the change in Mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.
Porthos went to the window, took a bar in his hands, clung to it and bent it like a bow; so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed.
“How can she be so?”
‘What we want,’ replied one, ‘is to communicate to you the will of his highness.
“M,” repeated Franz.
And he took hold of one within his reach; his two companions did the same thing.
“No, it is Bazin.”
Upon hearing D’Artagnan’s reply, Aramis seemed about to draw his sword, when Athos prevented him.
“An Englishman.”
The moon lighted the group.
Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms.
“With Madame!
You have not deceived me!
At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping; their legs began to tremble, and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters.
30245m
D’Artagnan raised himself on tiptoe, and as the carriage passed, saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the other.
“That’s true,” said he, quietly, “for my part I have never loved.”
Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy.
“A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities.
As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.
“Morrel,” said he, “do not forget what you have just seen.”
“Nevertheless, Raoul, you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de Saint-Remy.”
Fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot Dantès, and then kill himself.
My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so brilliant——”
But nothing escaped the count’s notice, and he observed a little note, passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice, from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the minister’s secretary.
He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.
Mousqueton, therefore, was soon provided with tools and he began his task.
Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.”
“I am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached.
I do not feel remorse, because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction.
This valet, whose name was Germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters, which he gave to Albert.
“Insolent!” cried Milady; and as if acted upon by a spring, she bounded toward the baron, who awaited her attack with his arms crossed, but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.
“Yes.”
The queen’s paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it, and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character.
He passed them, then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine, which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge.
“Yes, monsieur,” replied Raoul.
_Hola_, Lubin, my pistols!”
I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.”
Just think.
“No, count; but to leave Paris——”
“Oh,” cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, “wretch,—to reproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me!
It was evident that the execution was, in the eyes of the people, only the commencement of the Carnival.
I have just killed an old friend.”
“You perceive, then, that he is not happy?” said the count.
“This man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.”
Alone!
Did you pass through the Corso?”
At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty retreat.
The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments.
Porthos left the service, and in the course of the following year married Mme.
“Oh, monsieur!” said Bazin, clasping his hands supplicatingly.
It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply; not only was he the elder, but he had been presented to the prince by his father.
“Monsieur has returned, then?”
The last raised his eyes, to ascertain, doubtless, that neither his companions nor himself had been watched, and, in spite of the darkness, he perceived Gondy.
Strength and Sagacity.
We may easily conceive where Morrel’s appointment was.
To horse, my friends, to horse!”
“It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the Bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third.
As you please; it is ready in all ways.”
The remembrance of Milady recurred to D’Artagnan.
They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way, haughtily disdainful of their entreaties.
M. Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was closed; and, although I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer.
“Well?”
certainly, all four; we couldn’t leave our prisoners, could we?”
“No; you see plainly he is not dead.
“We are not come here, sir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness, or false professions of friendship,” said Albert, “but to demand an explanation.”
“Oh, that depends upon circumstances.
These words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way, and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.
Ali appeared.
’tis a bad example.
Now, Planchet has an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten to death.
“Ah, that gives me more confidence.”
“Yes, sir, all is fair in war, stratagem as well as force; look yonder!”
“_Pardieu!_”
Do you speak Spanish, Grammont?”
Was not Faria’s fate the better, after all—to solve the problem of life at its source, even at the risk of horrible suffering?
Then, arousing from his reverie:
His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal.
The count continued:
“But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?”
He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat.
What are you eating there, Porthos?”
They are men who do nothing for nothing.”
Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl.”
Mistrust Porthos, especially, who, to please the count whom he regards as God on earth, will assist him in contriving Mazarin’s escape, if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric.”
The duke counted two stories.
D’Artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years’ standing.
Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade.
“Where?”
Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault.
Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her costume.
I was told there were such at the last exhibition.”
You ask what I have against you; I tell you.
“Yes; or in the neighborhood.”
“If I am guilty, if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of,” shrieked Milady, “take me before a tribunal.
“Alas,” said Hermine, “doubtless it is chance.”
He sat all night on his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints.
“Always cautious, Planchet.”
The young man, having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel, which was opened, and again closed after his entrance.
“A magnificent cavalier,” remarked Mazarin.
“But if it is a woman who writes,” said Aramis, “and that woman desires not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, D’Artagnan; which is not the part of a gentleman.”
“Ah, good, then,” replied Athos, “we will teach them, these door breakers!”
He was seeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had placed his foot upon it.
A shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the second, a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third.
Did I ever say to you, when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of my party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said, ‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it will be our turn.’”
“Oh no; there will be some one at hand to pick it up.”
Now attach him to our party.
“If there is any left,” grumbled the jeering voice of Athos.
And so, my friends, we return to Paris?
“God grant you as much!

“Very droll,” he muttered, “very droll indeed,” and he again began to carve the fowl, when Peppino stopped the baron’s right hand with his left, and held out his other hand.
The secretary bowed and retired.
Milady smiled with a strange smile.
“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé.
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
“But observe,” cried D’Artagnan, “that there is a woman in the affair—a woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.”
“Let us see, what more does Athos say?”
As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement, ran to the sacristy, dressed himself quickly in the choir robes, and cleaving, thanks to that uniform, the crowd that filled the temple, approached Bazin, who, clad in his blue robe, was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir.
“I was reflecting, in the first place,” replied Dantès, “upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained.
She should have wanted nothing.”
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely.
“He will be one, as he says,” cried Porthos; “he will be one, sooner or later.”
“Stop—”
I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four crowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me I was not in a condition to purchase the Louvre.”
Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen; and if anything should happen, Mme.
You say, ‘Excuse me,’ and you believe that is sufficient?
“I never go there.”
One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his theory.
“I cannot have deceived myself,” he said; “I must look upon the past in a false light.
0059m
“What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?”
I?
“It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire.”
“If I had any money,” said D’Artagnan to himself, “I would go away; but I have none.
Are you coming, Morrel?”
Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.
“’Tis indeed they!” said she.
And what did the cuistre [pettifogger] say about me?”
“Allow me, Porthos,” said Aramis.
“You were right, sir,” said Anne.
“Really, my dear Gondy,” said the duchess, “you remind one of the Apocalypse.
“Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.”
On the contrary, there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory.”
I hastened to the innkeeper.
I shall have performed a good action, and my heart will be lighter.”
“And how much is the pension?”
“What do you mean?”
Two men lay prone upon the ground, one bathed in blood and motionless, with his face toward the earth; this one was dead.
‘Adieu, my lord,’ murmured my mother, determining quietly to await the approach of death.
“Well, those splendidly wild days may chance to come again; I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you, who were the very soul of our society.”
“Bayard.”
The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.”
“Tell the count,” replied Franz, “that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him.”
“And your precautions were successful?”
“Horrible!” ejaculated the priest.
D’Artagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze, when the baron, after walking scarcely more than twenty paces, returned—stood still—struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed:
Here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived, in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks, and produced eventually that shameful peace, at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested.
“Madame,” replied Bonacieux, “your august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.”
He knows all!
Who could have thought it?
“Ah, I know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.”
“Hold your tongue, will you?” said Danglars, pretending to restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the arbor.
“Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine?”
“Yours is a noble nature.” he said; “here is your sword.”
I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow.
“By my troth, yes.”
“You accept this young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?”
Beppo got in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to be asked twice.
Finally—”
That will be sufficient.”
de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the Champs-Élysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing-room.
As he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, D’Artagnan and Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.
“I had three, two of whom have left Paris, to go I know not where.
At this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_.
“A week ago,” continued Madame de Saint-Méran, “we went out together in the carriage after dinner.
who talks of killing Dantès?
“Add to that D’Artagnan’s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour, knowing that we were expecting him.”
“Alas!
I was then obliged to come back again.
“Stay,” said Beauchamp, “surely I am not deceived.”
One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet.
Perhaps if I employed my strength against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and consequently conquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am but a woman to them.
“Then I believe you.
“‘Art thou sure?’ said the man in the cloak.
He strictly followed the instructions he had received.
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name of “the stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know what it meant.
Chapter LXVIII.
Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.
She lived in a small town with her brother, who was a curate.
I will take him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he will say.”
We even joked very pleasantly, if I remember rightly, on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest.
“That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.”
I hate him so little that I should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul.”
If I take you, you will be hung!”
“But why not address yourself to your sister, the queen?” asked the girl.
“And wherefore do you not say, like the rest, your will?” replied the queen, in a low voice.
At Drake’s or Aaron’s one pays twenty-five lire for common days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and there’s an end of it.”
The boy, the hostess, and all the house had the same regard for D’Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors.
“Yes, saved—saved!
Madame de Longueville was persuaded.
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: “If I had listened to you,” Lord de Winter had said to Felton.
They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity.
“But does he not approach the walls while playing?”
At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused, as if he had partially appeased his hunger.
“The hand of the Lord is stretched over him,” said Felton; “he will not escape the chastisement he deserves.”
The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been accustomed to hear the “_Vive Napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne.
Dantès raised his head and saw Faria’s eyes injected with blood.
“I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask.”
The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men.
“Oh!” he said, looking at the stone, “this is the work of either Hercules or Porthos.
“Then I have full occupation, for I am so.”
“Well, I will avenge you of this wretch,” replied D’Artagnan, giving himself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia.
Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month.
“But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger, perhaps death.”
You suit me very well.”
Athos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and saluting those of the camp.
This voice startled her.
“Never.”
“We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,” said the king, who, in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready to make up all differences with her, “we shall see, but upon my honor, you are too indulgent toward her.”
At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.
“Why should you meddle with what does not concern you?”
Then the general advanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,—“I have a son,” said he, “and I ought to think of him, finding myself among assassins.”
“But?”
But do you happen to belong to him?”
Chapter 44.
“Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M.
Was it a transient vision, or was he face to face with reality?
“I do not know him,” returned Monte Cristo; “but I shall probably soon make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house of Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson & French at Rome.” As he pronounced the two last names, the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel.
Everything conspired to prove to D’Artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had happened.
The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass.
“The cry proceeded from the grotto.
I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cap Corse.
“What was his name?”
“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.
“We come from Paris, yes,” replied Athos, with the same courtesy; “what is there we can do for you?”
“Will the queen deign to follow my advice?”
“Yes,” said Porthos; “but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep; I think it is the wind.”
“On the contrary, I request it.”
Her hands clutched her armchair; she ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her.
“It is no nonsense; it is quite true.
“There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?”
At the second turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested permission to withdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal.
“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth.
“I want to know what crime I have committed—to be tried; and if I am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.”
“And you will place the king and queen in safety also, at Saint Germain?”
The king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity; he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly:
After a pause, which appeared an age to Rochefort, Mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter, and showing it to the count, he said:
“It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully.
“Is it not a joke?” said Danglars.
“No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but once afterwards, and that was from the Abbé Busoni himself, when I saw him in the prison at Nîmes.”
“An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me.”
“A thousand thanks,” said the count, “your invitation is most gracious, and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it.
Is he some minister out of office?”
Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not say a word.
“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”
“It shall take but a quarter of an hour, I answer for everything, madame; believe me, I know the people; they are like a great child, who only wants humoring.
And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted “Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!”
“And does he ever expect to be happy?”
“My friend,” said he, “here is a proof of it.”
“Do you wish to know why he bought it?”
“And then it was, I presume,” said Monte Cristo “that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?”
“And where are you going?”
“And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really united?”
“One of your friends?” interrupted Mme.
Morrel looked at him in utter amazement.
“Then,” said the stranger coolly, “he must be some prince in disguise.”
He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day, for fear of being recognized; he had therefore plenty of time before him, for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris, on the road to Meaux.
“I wish to do, madame, all that your majesty pleases.”
“And you found it?”
The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again.
If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.”
“What do they do?”
“Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive you at his house.”
“You know I hate moralizing, except when it is done by Athos.
“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.
“Well, then, go,—wait for me there, and I will soon join you.”
“Your name?” said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his cloak.
“Yes, madame, in your oratory.
Bonacieux.
The soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.
“Oh, it is terrible!” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation, after expressing acute sympathy with the father.
“What?”
“Cæs...
He was a man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises.
“Laporte,” said the duke, in a dying voice, “Laporte, do you come from her?”
Good!
“Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject.
“What?” said Porthos.
“Not in the least.”
Noirtier,” resumed M. d’Avrigny in the same pitiless tone,—“M.
“The last?”
“It was not I who made that promise,” cried Morcerf; “it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you have forgotten.
“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want nothing.”
It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end—useless injury is repugnant to every mind.
I shall use it again upon occasion.”
“But I have no permission to shoot over this island.”
“Now, Pistache, my good dog, jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montbazon.”
“Shall you have time?”
“No, thank you; I gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me.”
That is it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?”
“Still, baron,” said Monte Cristo, “family griefs, or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure, are endurable to a millionaire.
“I am an honorable man.”
After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while some friends of Dantès conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan.
“I will not.”
Raoul went out, and when Athos heard his young, joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain, he sighed.
“Mistrust yourself, John,” said he.
“It is not for me to judge.
And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian, who received him with great coldness.
In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which formed the _parterre_, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil.
“And, pray, how do you know that?”
Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins.
“But that is not a man’s name; that is the name of a mountain,” cried the poor questioner, who began to lose his head.
“For Andrea Rondolo?” asked Franz.
Mazarin himself, who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household, was alarmed.
The young man pressed Valentine’s hand to his lips, and then left the house by a back staircase.
There was silence.
“A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly; and at this moment, Albert, had nothing more transpired, your father’s cause had been gained.
“You foolish fellow!” said Athos, laughing.
“Never mind—take these;” and the count placed the packet in the man’s hands.

An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.”
We are, and have been these ten years, connected with the house of Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.
“That man has sagacity, honor and wit, not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution.
“And Monsieur de Bragelonne, a young man fifteen years of age, attached to the Prince de Condé—has he the honor of being known to you?” diffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings.
“We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,” said Dantès, “he is so easily mistaken.”
“So much the better for him,—he will suffer less,” said the inspector.
The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness.
“If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what he is; and perhaps become even less than he is.”
“Sinbad the Sailor?”
“Where the devil shall I say that he is, so that he cannot try to rejoin him?” thought D’Artagnan.
Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks.
“Himself.”
“I am comfortably off, monsieur, that’s all; I have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you understand, monsieur—But!—” cried the citizen.
She wore a beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet, fastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin, embroidered with silver.
Chapter 91.
“Scoundrel, infamous scoundrel!” howled Milady.
“All right.”
In what can I have offended her—I who ever since I have known her have lived at her feet like a slave?
At the next inn you will find a wounded man, now being attended by our servants, who has asked the assistance of a minister of God.”
Kitty’s detention was not long.
“There, now!
The crowd began to murmur and approached the house.
The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her.
Yes, dead, alas!
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone.
Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die, first Peppino and then Andrea.
But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain, D’Artagnan, who was completely ignorant of what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an explanation.
“No,” said Winter, then he paused; “but tell me, can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens?”
Mercédès smiled sadly.
You incline me to think so,” said the king.
Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair?”
“Speak, then, chevalier!” said the cardinal.
But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.”
“The plan is not wanting in grandeur; I see but one impediment.”
this is modesty indeed!” cried D’Artagnan.
It was our strength, our intelligence, our life, in short, that we promised.
Bonacieux.
“If, however, your wish should be one impossible to fulfill?”
Athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising, with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around:
“Yes; the road to Bayonne.”

“See, count,” she said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids—“see, our French grapes are not to be compared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will make allowance for our northern sun.” The count bowed, but stepped back.
“And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false account believe us to be in fault.”

She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted, the poor child fell and was not able to rise again.

He hoped, then, in a conversation with Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that conversation, and afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know, but which, in either case, would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister.
“Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,” said Caderousse.
“But it’s of no importance,” continued D’Artagnan, with natural assurance; “it’s of no importance.
That is the hour when I am expected.”
“Believe what?”

He then looked at the objects near him.
It was quite evident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread—so much the stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths.
Ring, then, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will dine together.”
“Allow me to observe, madame,” said the count, with that kind tone he could assume so well, “you are really very severe with that dear clever child.”

“My dear friend,” said Monte Cristo, “you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart.
“What Scotch?”
“Oh!
Monte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer.

You only know that this money exists.
“Yes; and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself.”

“You reconcile me, D’Artagnan.”
Mme.
“Cavalcanti!” said Debray.
“That’s true,” said D’Artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he found himself in, “that’s true.
“Didn’t you hear, fellow?”
“Good!” thought D’Artagnan; “a quarter of an hour to go to the tent, a quarter of an hour to return; it is more than we need.” Then turning, without the least change of countenance, to Porthos, he said, looking him full in the face: “Friend Porthos, listen to this; first, not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard; it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them.”
Haydée answered with a heartrending expression,
“No, sir,” said D’Artagnan; “and I will guard it so carefully that I will be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me!”

Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her.
Athos bowed and prepared to leave.
“And now, gentlemen,” said Planchet, who had not heard what they were saying, “what do you intend to do?”
“Upon what?”
“Amen!” said Athos, “and we will return to that subject later, if such be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, D’Artagnan, was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.”

Then there will be no blood, no groans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act,—then one escapes the clutch of the human law, which says, ‘Do not disturb society!’ This is the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern climes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance.”
Aramis, not wishing to part with his sword, selected a dark-blue cloak of a military cut.

The blow was parried.
“Sir,” said he to Maximilian, “you say you loved Valentine, that you were betrothed to her.

MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY
This silence and this interruption in serving, which were unintelligible to Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for the clerks.

“’Tis you, then, my dear count,” cried Gondy, offering his hand.
“What are you going to do?” exclaimed Athos.
“Certainly.”
The king, too, who had listened in the greatest agony, now breathed again.
“But of what sort?”
“Well, you see, my dear D’Artagnan, with what ill luck I play,” replied Porthos, with the most careless air in the world.
“Good heavens!
“Yes, I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not.”

“We are admired, i’faith,” answered Porthos.
“Still it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but, having received the signal that I might rest for an hour” (here he glanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of Montlhéry, even a sun-dial), “and having ten minutes before me, and my strawberries being ripe, when a day longer—by-the-by, sir, do you think dormice eat them?”

He stood with his arms folded, apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances.
We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman’s word, and that as he had said the horse was his, it must be so.”

He had made his valet cover him with honey; then, opening a feather bed, he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine.
The shot told; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad.
“And I,” said the queen, “think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it.
Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédès.
whether queens or not, they are always the same.”
Come, answer frankly.”
“‘The deliberations had already begun.
It might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw herself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman, “Go on—home!”
Albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair.
“You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,” said the baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.
“Blind fools!” murmured the count.
At one end was the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of parchment: _Julie’s Dowry_.
“Oh, were I not a foreigner!
“I hasten to do so.”
“Excuse me, sir,” replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; “I am not up there, I know, but I have only just come down.”
Five minutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed on the door, and I,” said Beauchamp, “shared the general expectation and anxiety.
“Was a lad of fifteen,” replied Peppino.
“Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d’Épinay?” asked he, although he knew it perfectly.
I said the origin of his fortune remained obscure.
A double movement of the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to him perfectly impossible.

Say to her: ‘Peace or war!
“‘We announce,’ he read, in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper, ‘that today, the 23rd of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated Don César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca Priori, convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa, and the men of his band.’
It was the Count de Rochefort.
D’Artagnan, however, could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her features.
“I do not understand you, sir,” said the baroness, trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face.
“Seven o’clock!” said Grimaud, who had not spoken a word.
“And that name of a town or village is written in her hand!” cried Athos.
“Yes, I admit it.
“I shall be proud to present you,” and Rochefort walked on.
“Say no more about it!
And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on.
I, who was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,—I, who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy,—I, who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy (a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful), I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course I was watching, and bitten to the heart!”
“And where is the unfortunate being?” asked Renée.
As for his suspicions, once on _terra firma_, once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to appetite.
“La Carconte, on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the door, opened it, saying, as she did so:
“Pardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.”
He was struck by a sudden idea.
“I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides, that is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali.
“But if your excellency doubt my veracity——”
“Provided I understand your perfidy, sir, and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged, I shall be reasonable enough,” said Albert furiously.
“Now, gentlemen,” said Athos, when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel, “let everyone retire to his own apartment.
“The executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,” said the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword.
But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment, he merely pushed him indoors, saying, “Let us go in.”
“But what has this vision of Henry IV.
The host remained standing in front of him, looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face, combining both gravity and sweetness of expression.
“To me?”
They traced her to Châlons, and there they lost her.”
“You would arrest the Duc de Beaufort, armed, in the field?”
“Well, will you try and overtake him?”
It is you who, with that mandate, obtained the pasha’s ring, which gave you authority over Selim, the fire-keeper!
“The truly guilty,” said Milady, “is the ravager of England, the persecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many women—he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to make England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and will betray them tomorrow—”
The Examination Chapter 8.
“Truly?”
“He knows them, then?”
Everything was here arranged in perfect order; each register had its number, each file of papers its place.
“Come, then, come, then!” cried Milady, trying to drag the young woman along by the arm.
This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted.
“Madame,” said Raoul, “the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached; it is as yet unknown to all, and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my guardian.”
There was no family, no servant; the tall man alone inhabited this house.
D’Artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said, “Well, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now?”
“Seeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb appearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de Tréville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that you and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would be pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn.”

Arrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he passed into the dressing-room, which he examined.
“Well, we must put up with that,” said the countess, who was herself from one of the oldest Venetian families.
But do you mean to say you have not heard of this?
Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready, learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes.
“Mousqueton, thy pistols,” said D’Artagnan.
“Mr.
I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest.
“I do.”
“Has the host told you nothing, then?”
“The old executioner of Bethune,” muttered Grimaud; “a man between fifty-five and sixty, tall, strong, swarthy, black hair and beard?”
“Pshaw!” said De Guiche.
“Good, the execution of plots is my forte.”
“Three days ago?
“Go,” said the count deliberately; “go, dear friend, but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world, that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love, and that I love you, Morrel.”
To quote some Latin verses I have forgotten, or rather, never knew well, ‘the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys,’ and I am a valley, dear Rochefort,—one of the lowliest of the low.”
“It will be too late; they will be gone.”
I should like to offer him a last salute.
“But now,” he said, “that you are a widower, your wife’s connection cannot injure you.”
It is too late.
He accepted my challenge, and, my faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his, without reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain.
He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him, he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin.
Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I do not hear her breathe.”
Could you allow me a few words in private.”
“How much is it worth?”
“I know that, and we sent him to the Bastile,” said Mazarin.
“Now,” said Albert, “that you have seen all my treasures, allow me to offer them to you, unworthy as they are.
He saw her get into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St. Germain.
“Well, bring it,” said Athos.
Athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself.
“Why do you address me so coldly—so distantly?” asked the young Greek.
“Certainly.
“Ah, ah!
D’Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as shadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended the stairs as quietly as possible, and entered D’Artagnan’s chambers.
I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her son.”
madame, more hopeless than he thinks.
“Oh, let us hope,” said Aramis, “that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit fathers.
“Oh!” answered another voice, which D’Artagnan instantly recognized as that of Aramis.
“Yes, I know you are a man of a stout heart, monsieur,” said the cardinal, with a voice almost affectionate; “I can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried, and even condemned.”
At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl?
“Well?”
“But,” said Milady, in a hollow, faint voice, “what brings you back to me, and what do you want with me?”
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the citizen, giving a still fainter intonation to his voice.
“Well, then——”
“Ah, he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards!
He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees.
The races, like the _moccoli_, are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the Carnival.
“I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your excellency.
“Why, what can have happened?” he exclaimed, “what has thus disturbed you?
Are there, then, two parliaments?”
Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him.
“Yes.
“On the contrary, Olivain is to stay and I am to go.
I took one of them by the throat and three-quarters throttled him.
Chapter 25.
“Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red successively, three or four times in one minute.”
“Come, sir,” he said, “lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid; you run no risks with me.
Speak, then, without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak; besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.”
Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream.
D’Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar.
Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen?
“Oh, yes!
0041m
Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend.”
But was it my father’s ring?
He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence, he waited.
Listen, it is impossible.
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.
Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, “We had a short discussion upon dress.”
“On the capture of Charles Stuart.
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “are you a D’Artagnan from Béarn?”
“Hollo!
“Monsieur le Prince.”
Then, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders, he said.
“Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness’s castle.”
But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach.
Chapter XI.
By diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler of Albania, Epirus, and adjacent territory.
“Here I am, my lord.”
“No nonsense, Caderousse!”
“And who found this father for you?”
The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table, illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the abbé in a monk’s dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the Middle Ages.
“True,” replied Faria, “we are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes, and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.”
He continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos.
He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hôtel.
Father and Son Chapter 13.
“The man is tired,” said the captain, “conduct him to his bed.”
“No, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends.” And Porthos, turning on his heel, made a step to retire.
I did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity!” and a bitter laugh escaped the count.
Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty, proud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which was made still longer by a _royal_ (or _imperial_, as it is now called), surmounted by a pair of mustaches.
Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin.
Which is my best cavalry horse?”
“He is in Vendome, where he will wait until I write to him to return to Paris.”
“And the Scotch?”
In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon, the gallery adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same floor, were filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little in the event, but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen.
Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death.
This is the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the following subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration—‘_Utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_.’”
But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other, the people, catching sight of him whom they called their liberator, uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle.
“I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion.
he is really dead.
“Come in, my braves,” said the king, “come in; I am going to scold you.”
On their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a step, uttered cries of enthusiasm.
“Well then, if we can get Athos, all will be well.
1.E.1.
This very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it.
He pressed the count’s hand and left.
I will not acknowledge a crime in my house; for when crime enters a dwelling, it is like death—it does not come alone.’ Listen.
Albert ran to fetch a carriage.
The cardinal rang a second time.
This evening’s adventure will serve for my excuse.
Then he took the boy upon his knee.
“Yes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line.
Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and replied coldly:
“Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm, “does not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance.”
Whether he spoke seriously or in jest, since it was evident that under existing circumstances D’Artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen’s uneasiness, Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy; and as he had foreseen, the queen gave orders to introduce Monsieur d’Artagnan at once.
You were rich when I married you, but little respected.
“I accept it,” interposed D’Artagnan, proudly.
The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and from them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom.
“Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that, my little viper?”
Chapter XIII.
This point, settled, the duke turned to D’Artagnan.
as to you, that is not my concern, and I shall sup either with or without your permission.”
“Do you pity him?
However, his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was the situation.
“Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life, like those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their emperor and heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently glided into death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?”
I was so delighted to see her again!
“At the hotel of——,” said Porthos; “by my faith—nor do I remember it either.”
“Along the wall, sir,” said Mazarin, “there will be no danger of losing yourselves.”

“At La Réserve!
good Heaven,” said Planchet, “what a misfortune!
To-day, look around you, and it may astonish you, that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord de Winter, the friend of twenty years, and you, gentlemen, whom I see for the first time and whom I know but as my countrymen.”
“Oh, nothing!
There is a horse, while on the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master.”
“I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions.
I have two horses,—I do not count my servant’s bobtailed nag.
One morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day, leaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence.
Now, then, what had I better do?”
“Really, captain,” said D’Artagnan, determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced, “the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak French.
A recollection of Athos came into her mind.
Can this be another vengeance of that woman?”
Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the ground with his forehead.
A sigh escaped him.
“This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,” said Emmanuel.
“Still by one of your forty methods, your highness?”
He opened the conversation about rain and fine weather; the travelers replied.
If he comes out we shall catch him.
He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy; he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and the landscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors.
Monte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he said in Greek, “Πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν,”—that is, “Tell us the fate of your father; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason.” Haydée sighed deeply, and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.

“Since we are out,” said Beauchamp, “let us call on M. de Monte Cristo; he is admirably adapted to revive one’s spirits, because he never interrogates, and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters.”
I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all I meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents.
“And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post?”
The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it.
Chapter LXIV.
The count stopped.
A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface.
“Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”
At this moment my mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves, she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion.
The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction seizes on his mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance.
Besides, it came into the young man’s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would, perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair.
“Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you.
D’Artagnan sprang back; the wall had closed again.
“He’s a fine looking fellow,” said another; “if he had only a comb and hair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids.”
The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais Royal.
He was well known at the Hôtel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered him a good comrade.
“Eh!
There was nothing particular about it, excepting that, although daylight had disappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated.
“Heyday!” cried D’Artagnan, drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse; “are you not mistaken?
“You keep the registers of entries and departures?”
However, we have them safe in prison, and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient.
“‘Silence, child!
Two men, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as escort.
“No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office.

“Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have turned them into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.”
“Well, this is just what amuses me,” said Monte Cristo.
“A nobleman retired from service, is he not?”
“How?”
You have only to wait here till I release you.”
The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth.
“Yes, sire,” said Aramis, “yes, you are right.
The garden became darker still, but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps.
“Oh!” cried Porthos, as if in pain.
“And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits; from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door.
sir!”
“More than ever.
“I do not drink”—Bazin pushed away with dignity the officer’s hand—“’tis good only for the laity.”
The curates asked him what was to be done.
He was not mistaken; as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window.
“Ah, count, I shall forget it.”
Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his expressions of delight.
“You care about it, then, so much?”
The opportunity was good.
“No, sir.”
Franz waited until all was in order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken their places—three forward, and one at the helm—he resumed the conversation.
Can they have received any news, my lord?”
“Indeed!” said the gentleman.
“My father’s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.”
The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the past.
If your friends are the more speedy, you are to be saved; if the satellites of the cardinal, you are lost.”
The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès, thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the pioneers was wounded.
“I respected your father very much,” said he.
His was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor, a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltiot de Méré, or a Vitry.
“Baroness,” said Danglars, “give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at Rome.
“Sire, Cromwell has arrived this night at Newcastle.”
The host opened.
“He returned to London at the first sound of war.”
“That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge.
Rochefort extended his hand to D’Artagnan, who took it.
“A Lutheran?”
A presentiment instantly told D’Artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.
You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself?”
“These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,” sighed poor Renée.
“That’s correct; wait!”
“What is the matter?” said the count.
“In the name of heaven, my Lord!” cried Mme.
Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words.
I ruined?
“There are five of them,” said Athos, half aloud, “and we are but three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man.”
“Paid the last debt of nature?”
He had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second.
“For my part,” said D’Artagnan, “I say this must come to an end; murderer, as you were, of your uncle!
The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.
Bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to D’Artagnan’s door, and knocked.
But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she exposed herself to such hazards?
For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as incongruously organized as ours, ‘Perhaps some day I shall have to do with the king’s attorney’?”
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from his box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse, and held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain, sunk beside his companion.
“To saddle, gentlemen!
“She is under the big chestnut-tree,” replied the spoiled brat, as he gave, in spite of his mother’s commands, live flies to the parrot, which seemed keenly to relish such fare.
D’Artagnan took a pen and wrote:
“You remain minister; that is understood,” said D’Artagnan; “France needs you.”
“And how do you know her?”
From that moment she watched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures—even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh.
Chapter LXXI.
The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three steps.
Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role.
“That is just,” said Richelieu.
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue Férou on a very handsome _genet_.
I think the arm will make up for the sword.”
“Oh, I will be a match for you!” murmured Milady, between her teeth; “be assured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier, who has cut his uniform out of a monk’s frock!”
have they allowed the headsman to escape?”
The mask and beard became you very well, and as to the axe, I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment.
“I beg your excellency’s pardon for keeping you waiting,” said the man, in the Roman dialect, “but I don’t think I’m many minutes after my time, ten o’clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran.”
“Forgive me, sir,” said Franz in a resolute tone.
At this moment Laporte reappeared.
“Well,” replied D’Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos’s ear, and lowering his voice, “Milady is marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ upon her shoulder!”
Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was disguised.”
“To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and as I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M. Cavalcanti to him.”
I attach great importance to the question I am about to put to you.
But he was no longer there, having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee, misled by false intelligence of the enemy’s movements.
for a hundred pistoles I have discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns; without reckoning the value of that diamond”—he cast a complacent look at the ring, which he had kept, instead of restoring to D’Artagnan—“which is worth, at least, ten thousand francs.”
The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely distinguish.
I was like you, and had a king in keeping.”
“Let us see,” said he, “I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen.
“And where am I?” inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.
You know, Raoul, Grimaud is an old and zealous servant; he will follow you.”
“‘Your mode of life as a smuggler,’ said he to me one day, ‘will be the ruin of you; if you get out, don’t take it up again.’
At the Palais Royal, the crowd, which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater; like an impetuous mob, a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Honore.
turned around, astonished that any one should dare to address him.
I shall hear this morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and at his wife’s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France.
Every night the count had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier.
At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river.
The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question.
“Hold on!
“It must be on some elevated place, whence a given signal may be seen in every part of Paris.”
Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation, and wishes to provide for the future.
“But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be sweeping.”
Ask yourself, wherefore, after rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its mother?
For the rest, the storm which raged within her doubled her strength, and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind.
“Excellency,” said a servant, opening the door, “a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you.”
Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: ‘At this moment, a friend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian, watches over me!’”
He had made up his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would learn what his Eminence had to say to him.
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Tréville began to disquiet, “the devil!
Aramis, less self-controlled, fumbled continually with his hidden poniard.
Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure—the banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into the bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard.
“Ah,” murmured Caderousse, “what a strange priest you are; you drive the dying to despair, instead of consoling them.”
The lowest or the least known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.
“What, then, is this precious stuff?”
Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by a single jewel.
Well, why should not we, too, belong to a party?
In each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses.
“You surprise me.
“I am waiting for no one,” replied D’Artagnan, who was beginning to be angry.
Although he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Tréville’s courtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at length noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted.
I will, however, inform Monsieur d’Artagnan of your arrival here.”
“My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence.”
These words of Felton’s passed like ice through her veins.
Someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged.
“And where is he going?” asked D’Artagnan.
God will punish you!
At this moment Grimaud appeared at the door.
I never had a vocation for the bands; my cassock is fastened by one button only, and I am always ready to become a musketeer once more.
“How do you know that?”
With these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and, by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was accustomed to do at night.
He kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture, the provisions his jailer brought him—at first gayly, then with deliberation, and at last with regret.
D’Artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver.
“This, then,” continued Aramis, “was my first opinion; but as I am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment, but to ask the opinion of others, I have inquired—Eh!—my friend——”
The sides of the walls seem to close in, even to press against him.
At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.
It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed, but had not had sufficient strength to do so.
“Oh, I am already grandly recompensed!” cried D’Artagnan.
He was approached to be examined, and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat, that he was an officer of the musketeers, he was surrounded, with the intention of making him cry, “Down with Mazarin!” The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first; but when he discovered what it meant, he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied.
“And when did you arrive here?” inquired she.
Athos saw the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to allow themselves to be taken.
You asked me the cause of my being late, and why I come disguised.
“The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer; they were descending the steps leading to the cavern.
I had an affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me—a heart like yours, Felton, a man like you.
“Will you not give it, sire?” asked Athos.
Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl.
Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret!”
that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproach—the watchword with which they assassinated, hanged, and made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would assassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then.
“Come in, my host.”
“Then add that his Grace has, in the precipitation with which he quit the Isle of Ré, forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen, inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France.
“Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes!”
“You will not reply, however, and these gentlemen, I am sure, will presently be of my opinion.”
“And you have reason, for she is much to be pitied.

“That’s exactly what my wife said, monseigneur.”
He returned to his room, and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort, for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones, he called to Bernouin to undress him, regardless of the noises of gun-fire that, though it was now near midnight, continued to resound through Paris.
“You asked for candor and you have it.
“Alas!” murmured the voice.
“Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.”
He determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he could when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he perceived the extremity of another musket.
There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force.
Ah!
He has six millions’ worth.”
“What are they, your excellency?”
De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age, but he was scarcely taller than Raoul, who was only fifteen.
June and July were the terrible months with Athos.
Bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar.
“Come, then,” said D’Artagnan, “you are right.
“‘The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course.
“Yes, the servant has given his description.
Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him.
A shudder ran through the young man’s frame.
“There you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of the past!
‘Take courage, Vasiliki,’ said he; ‘today arrives the firman of the master, and my fate will be decided.
We have seen them at Villefort’s; they proceeded then on their course.
But what ails you?
And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience, how did all this come to pass?”
“Now, tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity?”
“You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly.
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend—a friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, ‘Maximilian, it was Edmond Dantès!’”
“Excellency,” said he gravely, addressing Franz, “if you look upon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your interest I——”
“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a measure of self-preservation.”
She was dressed, that is to say, in dishabille, wrapped in a long, warm dressing-gown.
“An apoplectic stroke?” repeated the doctor.
“Oh!” cried Athos.
Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires.”
He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the host.
“Florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same.”
Each time he had been brought into contact with his father, something terrible had happened.
His little gray eyes shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the only part of his face in which life survived.
But M. de Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young man resolved to tell him everything.
In the front room the follower was also still asleep, her head leaning back on the chair, in all respects worthy of her mistress.
Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”
“Listen—when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather sensitive.”
The dying man collected all his forces.
“That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying.
“Impossible, for three reasons,” replied Athos.
“Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?”
At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.
D’Artagnan bowed and went out.
“You are going, sir?”
“Porthos, take yours from your holsters.”
“Indeed!” said Danglars, “he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.”
“Thanks, M. Bertuccio,” said the count, springing lightly up the three steps of the portico; “and the notary?”
An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek.
“Shall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count?”
It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his name.
I was induced to marry her about three years ago, although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the queen’s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.”
“Wretch,” cried D’Artagnan, “speak quickly!
At this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples became purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry.
But what is the meaning of all these questions?”
Edmond listened, and the sound became more and more distinct.
I know that you belong to the cardinal, but belong to me as well, and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune.
“I was saying to him only yesterday, ‘You are imprudent, Monsieur Count; for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected.’ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘what next?’ ‘Well, next, some day you will be robbed.’”
No one has seen D’Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared.
“But, my lieutenant,” said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and who had approached Milady, “this woman is not asleep.”
“You comprehend?” said Porthos.
I have only to say, after the little that I have seen and heard, that I think even better of you than I have been told.”
Her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly:
“I am about to tell you, wretched man.”
“‘Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter—perhaps they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission.
The abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular delight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away.
“Oh, oh!” said he; “here is a soup which is rather inviting.”
“If there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden.
Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.
Then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms.
As a proof, remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night.”
“I think that with a hundred francs a month——”
Is this possible, count?”
“In that case I will go.”
“All was quiet, but on returning from M. Beauchamp’s, I found madame in tears; she had sent for me to know when you would return.
M. de Tréville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris, it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort.
“Ah, excuse me, then,” said D’Artagnan.
“Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine.
“The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are.”
There was no peculiar indication in any organ—an excitement of the nervous system—that was it; a case of cerebral congestion—nothing more.
Chapter XXX.
Porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words:
Chapter XV.
“Mark well what I say.
This costs us nothing, and saves the life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption.”
At last he sank.
“Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman.
I have but ten days, and this evening two of them will be gone.”
Oh, if you are struck in France, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run mad.
However, she offered the cardinal Laporte’s place, which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other.
“And who told you to defend the king?”
the president is speaking to the king.”
Accustomed, however, as he was to the work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words,
“That is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first time; and because I am only twenty.”
“Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as Rothschild.”
Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman strength, the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs.
Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked, “Have you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars, for in all probability I shall return to Paris?”
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.
We have no need, therefore, to say that D’Artagnan dared not join in the conversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard-of things which were taking place.
“Thank you, I understand.
Will it be the same this evening?
“He has, unfortunately, too much wit.”
“He has come!” thought Milady.
It is the longest road, but certainly the most amusing.”
Then M. de Tréville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except D’Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.
As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved.
All falsehood is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.
But poor Captain Leclere——”
“Where, then?” said Athos, smiling, “if it be not a secret.
“Tell the Comte de la Fere to come to me,” said Madame de Chevreuse, “I want to speak to him.”
“You pity me, little one?” said D’Artagnan.
You are welcome, gentlemen,” she said.
Only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest.”
The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.
“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the president.
Chapter XVIII.
“Oh, D’Artagnan, my beloved D’Artagnan!
“What, what!” cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, “what words do you utter?
Of all this household, only two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.
In June the profit amounted to 900,000.
But you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies, occasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to you, rude as it may seem, ‘My brother, you sacrifice greatly to pride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.’”
Albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow.
Die in peace!”
He went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty.
“Yes, and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you captain.”
In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who, uneasy herself, had anticipated her mother.
“Very well; I know all that I wish to know.
The duke has had many affairs of gallantry; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy, he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities.”
As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together.
Monsieur d’Artagnan sides with Mazarin!
The Telegraph Chapter 61.
I do not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline is the same for them as for everybody else.”
He followed him.
Yet I let him die!
“Follow him,” said Athos.
Involuntarily his languid eyes closed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.
Devil take it,” he muttered to himself, “don’t let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them.”
As I rode by the count’s house I perceived a light in one of the windows, and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain.
You are safe—you are free.”

Chapter XXXVII.
It was dark and silent as the tomb.
Franz followed Albert with his eyes, and saw him mount the first step.
“How so?”
He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrel’s petition, and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to say, was in Villefort’s handwriting.
“I will tell you, Mr. President.
I am afraid he has turned out ill,” she added.
“That is unreasonable,” said Athos, saluting in his turn the two cavaliers.
“Well?”
“Edmond Dantès.”
“The Count of Monte Cristo.”
I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was—the Count of Spada.
“It was the date of that strange adventure,” interrupted Madame de Chevreuse.
He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed.
Is he not peculiar?”
The conversation took a cheerful turn.
“I know nothing of that.”
“They have some capital wine here—please to observe that in passing.
“No.”
Franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard the gratification of Albert’s eager impatience, but began at once the tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his coat.
“His father.”
His house has been full ever since.
In ten minutes D’Artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate, the points and crossed bars of which were gilt.
It was Friquet’s voice; and Dame Nanette, feeling herself supported, recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk.
0148m
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me.
“You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina, do you not?”
“Yes; my son, and a sacred command.”
Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture.
It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.
“I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty, Monsieur de Rochefort.
I take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new railway line; you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you, M. Debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de Château-Renaud, in pleasing a woman; and you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride.
“You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.”
Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba.
“No; you are, on the contrary, adorable.”
“For me?” cried the boy, his eyes sparkling with joy, “if I can find out where Bazin is going?
Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of France.
“If you arrive safely at home——”
Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him.
“Yes.”
Chapter XXVII.
“Madame, I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais.”
“Afraid of being heard!
The signatures were perfectly legal.
There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver.
And I have the same sincerity to show you, if you wish, Monsieur d’Herblay; I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me.”
“Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?” asked he.
“Count,” said he, “you have offered us places in your carriage, and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace.
0327m
It was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below, and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings.
Give him a lesson, Debray.”
Bravo, count, bravo!”
But first write your request to Dessessart.
So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another man’s fortune.
Instead of returning directly home, D’Artagnan alighted at the door of M. de Tréville, and ran quickly up the stairs.
Of this, however, be assured, that should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present.”
Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met.
“Sire,” resumed Tréville, “as I told you, Monsieur d’Artagnan is little more than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he was dressed as a citizen.
“Stop!
“And he is not robbed?”
“Oh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken the resolution to tell you so.”
“I prefer waiting here,” said the messenger, with a smile.
But that must be a princess, at least—that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!”
“Yes, that’s probable,” said D’Artagnan.
Because he had no cash to save.
He is in a very picturesque place—do you know the catacombs of St. Sebastian?”
The bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that the grave is not far distant.
“Today is the 30th of July, 1816,—why, it is but seventeen months.”
But notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of Monte Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible voyage, the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory.
“The thin, spare man?”
The carriage stopped.
“Yes.”
I am very fortunate,” added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, “to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy.” And by the rapid glance that the young man’s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness.
“Bad weather!” observed one of the bearers; “not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea.”
M. de Tréville, who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the episode of the napkin.
These words struck D’Artagnan like a thunderbolt.
“I defy your Eminence to prove it,” cried Tréville, with his Gascon freedom and military frankness; “for one hour before, Monsieur Athos, who, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel, with the Duc de la Trémouille and the Comte de Châlus, who happened to be there.”
“Worldling,” murmured the count.
His apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him.
Dantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly.
Besides, his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me.
Athos merely glanced at it.
“Then it is settled,” said the count, “and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated.”
He turned round; it was Danglars.
He might fail, but something must be left to chance.
Then walking towards Morrel, he took his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor.
“What is this name of Monte Cristo?” inquired the countess, when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers, “is it a family name, or the name of the estate, or a simple title?”
“Presently—there are not a sufficient number of people here yet; we shall be remarked.”
“Art thou dangerously wounded, my dear Mousqueton?” he said.
“Not at all.
“Truly they are,” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.
“Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort, that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine?”
“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”
“Madame Danglars?
The king raised himself, buckled on his belt, and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead, said:
They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn.
“He will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion.”
“Singular man!” muttered Gondy, taking his hat to go away; but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door.
He therefore found D’Artagnan alone, and as it was nearly eight o’clock he took the young man with him.
“And you—fellows,” resumed Mousqueton, “stay near Monsieur le Comte d’Artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to prepare my lord for his visit.”
“Oh, my friend,” cried Dantès, “on the contrary, it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.”
“And you reply?”
Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen were only two against four, they began to cry, “To the rescue!
“So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.”
Let us talk of those, if you please.
But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.”
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might not awake when it was needed.”
For heaven’s sake, do not serve as a conductor between that man and me.
The month passed, and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources.
“Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue Coq-Héron.”
The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate, but to a friend.
Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Tréville, who, as we have said, were that evening on guard.
He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air.
Their connection could not last long without ruining both.
“Edmond,” said the poor mother, who tried every means, “when I call you Edmond, why do you not call me Mercédès?”
“What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.
The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin, and there could now be no doubt that he was the count.
“By the female side, I believe?” said the procurator, maliciously.

“Yes, madame,” Chatillon stammered out.
But that has passed away as suddenly as it came, and is forgotten.”
The keeper relaxed his hold.
You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage-contract.

D’Artagnan, after asking the man the right way, continued his route, agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman.
“Permit me, madame, to express my surprise,” said the abbess.
As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door.
He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera.
I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in want of money today.”
It is men who drive me to death; it is men who make you weep.”
D’Artagnan could not restrain a smile.
Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos.
Now I can promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that way.”
_Our friend_ will see you soon, and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed.
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII., and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal.
No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.”
“You have, then, seen something?” replied D’Artagnan.
Dantès remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.
I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am preceding him by a few days.”
“Well, then,” answered Aramis, “pray tell me a day or two beforehand, that I may take that opportunity of going to Paris.”
Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the door.”
“Was he so sweet, then?”
A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascon’s uneasiness.
“You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?” asked he, smiling.
Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.
As soon as the door of Gondy’s study was opened a man rushed in.
“You are deceived, monsieur; I know her very well.”
“Fairfax,” answered a laughing voice, the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman, “is not such a fool as to be here.”
“Yes, like a clap of thunder.”
“Pooh!
From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him?
“Yes, the ground is all sown,” said the Jesuit, “and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another upon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest, _aves cœli comederunt illam_.”
“Ah,” added the turnkey, “there was no occasion for watching him; he would have stayed here fifty years, I’ll answer for it, without any attempt to escape.”
Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.”
“Ah, _pardieu!_ Is that you?” said Porthos to D’Artagnan.
Valentine?
Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?—a false telegraphic despatch—it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams.
“With all my heart,” returned Albert; “Italian cigars are horrible.
“Sir?”
“Possibly, after all.”
“Why so?” asked Mordaunt.
But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_?—the gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.
“Listen!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Why, it is with him I am also going to fight,” said Porthos.
“God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him.
The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.
I must live henceforth without rank and fortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one.
In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the steward’s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village.
“Here I am,” Albert said.
“If that’s the case,” said Mousqueton, with a learned air, “take some nourishment.”
Whenever this occurred, although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen, Anne looked at D’Artagnan anxiously.
On the king’s service.”
“Monsieur de Tréville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family, like me, madame; he occupied that post for twenty years.”
The spit turned, the stove roared, the pretty Madeleine wept; D’Artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger, cold and love.
“He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady.
“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.
He tried it on his left hand; it fit his finger as if made for it.
But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in every year,—the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of St. Peter.
“Ah, true,” said Aramis.
The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross; the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat, which was on the ground.
“We bear witness to this,” said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner as before.
Athos smiled.
Be more economical.”
50056m
Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be admitted, upon something widely different from ambition.
Broussel!”
“No,” replied D’Artagnan; “I regret to see that we, hitherto united, are opposed to each other.
She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like the Laird of Ravenswood in _The Bride of Lammermoor_.
My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic, gave it to this wretch.”
He thought of Aramis, who, without possessing any greater advantages than himself, had formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse, who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day; and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish, some in ambition, others in love, whilst others, either from chance, or from ill-luck, or from some natural defect or impediment, remain half-way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations.
At length an honorable peer, Morcerf’s acknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived.
They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow.
“You speak very suddenly of love, monsieur,” said the young woman, shaking her head.
The duchess shook her head.
Besides, I shall only take the time to go and return.”
“Ah!” said Franz, “then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?”
“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.
“Speak!”
“I am acquainted with it.”
“My faith!
“Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but, doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered.
“You think so?
Planchet*, whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hôtel de Ville, telling him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.
“Certainly, quite ready.”
Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever.
“Whom do I see yonder?”
“That doubles the offense,” said Porthos, disengaging his arm from that of the procurator’s wife; “for if you are rich, Madame Coquenard, then there is no excuse for your refusal.”
“One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had disappeared.
“When do you wish the carriage to be here?”
Her skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable.
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid the red color in which the house was painted.
“Yes.
At eleven o’clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards, bringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately through the Hôtel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.
“Yes, yes,” replied Mazarin.
This time it was Mordaunt who smiled.
yes, kill them!” cried D’Artagnan; “I see fresh tracks; ’tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place.”
All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar.
“On a court.”
“On!
“Thou alone, on the contrary, knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily.”
“Yes, but he has been avenged.
He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.
“You are quite right, Beauchamp,” observed the young aristocrat.
I had the money with me; I made the tenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so much wanted, I galloped to Auteuil.
“Are you certain of it, sir?”
“I am alone,” said the abbé, “and I will again have pity on you, and will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to, if you tell me the truth.”
The demands in that programme must be granted.”
“Begin with me, my lord; for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one’s destination.”
Mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment, her admiration, and her gratitude.
“Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man!” said D’Artagnan.
Friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear.
“Nothing.”
It was one of the Gascon’s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty.
The Catalans Chapter 4.
Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance.”
I tried to open the door, but it was locked inside; then I called the sergeant.”
He had apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him.
“Be kind enough to pardon me, madame; but in this circumstance I am but the instrument which the king employs.
And according to his custom D’Artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him.
He concluded by calling for an investigation, which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion.
“Speak, monsieur,” said Villefort.
I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”
“Does he regret me a little?
For form’s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day.
The door yielded.
“Why,” said Albert, “he was talked about for a week; then the coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Mars’s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.”
The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered her apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie.
But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it.
His speech, therefore, was so well turned, that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh, they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule.
Why?”
“Ah,” said Albert, “it was she.”
“Between Saint-Venant and Aire.”
My Lord,—Your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand.
“Gascon-headed man, will you have done?” said the king.
“Yes,” returned Franz, “for the very three days it is most needed.”
“As you please,” he said; “death is always death,—that is forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from grief.”
“Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.”
“Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is like losing her a second time.”
“Yes.”
“Bah!” said Athos to the commissary, “if you have no more need of me, send me somewhere.
“Well, monseigneur,” replied the latter, “three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don’t know how many Rochellais.”
It is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already arrested, and with D’Artagnan, who most probably will be.”
“Franz assured me,” replied Albert, “that she was sixty-six years old.
But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can tell them my father’s.
The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.
Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once.
’Tis true that he came the next morning to my house, thinking that he had to do with an abbé—like all other abbés.”
Milady is fair, you say?”
“You have a daughter, then, madame?” inquired the count; “very young, I presume?”
Arrest them.”
Chapter XXXI.
“What are my commands?” said the queen.
The butt end of the musket hovered over his head, and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes, when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat.
Some voices even added: “Long live the marshal!” But all took up the cry in chorus: “Down with Mazarin!”
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.
“Did you fear that we should forget it?”
“Well, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his Majesty permission to plead for him.”
“And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so unjust——”
Valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks.
“She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.”
By a chance, which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on the wane, did not rise until eleven o’clock, and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity.
a dead horse!” said D’Artagnan, pulling up his horse, which shied; “it seems their horses, too, are breaking down, as well as ours.”
However insignificant I am, I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death.”
The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret—the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of which all the world was ignorant, except himself.
“Host,” said he, “could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me?
“Very well,” returned Dantès, dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad.
“And now,” demanded the count, “are all the forms complied with?”
“How, monsieur!
“Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep.”
“That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.”
“My antagonist took flight,” replied De Guiche “and left me at liberty to come to your assistance.
Stop a minute—ah, this is it: ‘Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,’ which means, ‘Beware of the enemy who makes you presents.”
Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion.
He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony; and Porthos, in full dress, mounted his finest horse, taking the part of supernumerary musketeer, as D’Artagnan had so often done formerly.
“Yes, we will wait.
Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter it as a conqueror.
Ah, don’t touch me, pray don’t.”
The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria’s or Dantès’ cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.
“Gracious heaven,” exclaimed he.
He had foreseen all.
“Madame,” he said, “you have wished to conquer the prince your brother—that is to say, the greatest captain of the age; and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it.
Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting; and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.
But to return to our subject.”
“All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal.
“’Tis well, and may this money profit you!
and how proceed?”
Nothing was heard but cries of “Live the Musketeers!
You would be the happier for it at home, sire, and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad.”
“Read that,” he said.
This note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an indelicacy.
“Good,” thought Milady; “she takes a pleasure in my conversation.
“I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner, or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.”
ah!” said D’Artagnan, “there are two of them, then!”
MY DEAR ATHOS, I wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest for a fortnight.
“Wait a moment,” said Athos, “perhaps they do not recognize your majesty’s voice, and await the order of their captain.”
People do not go out from it by the door, but by the window; one doesn’t descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle, but by the branches of a lime-tree; and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the Prince de Marsillac.”
The fowl had not been poisoned—she had died of apoplexy.
“Let us go the same way; we will stop at La Réserve, and we can drink a glass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.”
“What?
Bonacieux; in a tone of reproach, “ah, monsieur, I had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman.
Chapter XLII.
Some of your people have committed the strangest mistake—they have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel.”
From the same drawer she took a man’s complete costume, from the boots to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing superfluous, but every requisite.
“Who are you?” said the voice.
Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose eye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.
“Yes.”
“Indeed?” said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have said, “Oh, well, what do I care?”
“No, Kitty, you are mistaken.
Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him.
Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.”
Milady arose.
Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married.
The same flower of innocence had flourished, or was still flourishing, on their brow, that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house.”
“But what are we going to do there?”
“But why should it?”
“Gentlemen,” said he, “leave me alone with Patrick and Laporte—ah, is that you, De Winter?
Do you know her?”
I love retirement and silence, because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days.
Moreover, D’Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.
“You approve of him?”
“Speak on,” said Aramis.
“But has he any enemies?”
Egad!
“Doubtless; what does that imply?”
On my return, Vasiliki and her daughter Haydée had disappeared.’—‘Did you know them?’—‘My intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them, and I had seen them above twenty times.’
“Oh, no, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo; “I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar.
Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of Goethe’s heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte Cristo’s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger.
“All now,” replied La Ramee.
“Then,” said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all due to offended paternal love,—“then, mademoiselle, you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin?”
I say nothing about Blaisois, for he is only fit to hold the horses.
It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear.
This, too, was the opinion of Comminges, who withdrew somewhat reassured.
What do you say to that?”
Porthos, in spite of a touch of vanity, has many excellent qualities.
They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted up—they went in there.
“The Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?” said he.
“‘Then it seems I am to eat alone,’ remarked the jeweller.
The Fifth of October
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors.
“Because I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody to know I am living; so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields.”
“Yes, sire.”
You see I am dying!”
“But,” said he, “so long as I do remain in Paris, and nothing forces me to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me?”
The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the enemy guarded this bastion.
“I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order to speak to you without being overheard.
“Thanks, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo, “my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre.”
Cromwell is stout and short, and this man thin and lanky, rather tall than otherwise.”
Although our friends were expecting that condemnation, it filled them with grief.
Some day the people will burn that house, as they burned that of the Marechal d’Ancre.
Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory.
“I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel.
Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.
Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if it be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his Eminence in horror.”
“And does she try to make you dislike me?”
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows.
I have seen Milady.”
“Nothing,”—the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner—“except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions.
“Please, sir,” said the boy, “do you think I can gain any more half-pistoles in any way?”
“And these men are in France, my lord?”
D’Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the Rue d’Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night.
I remembered him well.
All three then cried: “All’s over.”
“When?”
At seven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled.
“‘Well,’ inquired the jeweller, ‘is the cash all right?’
At this moment a little boy, half peasant, half foot-boy, came to announce supper.
I am the bearer of a letter, that is all.
He even went so far as to show us the way out; he led us to the park wall, which we climbed over without accident, and then we fell in with Grimaud.”
“Certainly, I will.”
“Of how much does he rob you every year?”
“I will break every bone in your body!” cried the duke.
Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:
You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.
“Well, what then?”
“The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.”
The Countess G—— wished to revive the subject of the count, but Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of Albert’s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days.
The king pointed this out.
“Mademoiselle,” cried Valentine; “mademoiselle!
Milady was about to cry out, “Immediately,” but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward D’Artagnan.
50233m
“Deuce take it!” cried D’Artagnan, more moved than he had been for a long time, “don’t despair, my friend, if you have not received any letters from the count, we have received one.”
0039m
“My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third curiosity.”
“I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen.”
The sound of a kiss was heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue.
“Better, my lord.”
The countess had this portrait painted during the count’s absence.
“Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound contempt.
You, count, who are more than mortal, will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you not?”
Friend Mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an increase of supplies.”
“I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.”
“How so?” asked Beauchamp.
Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie.
Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs.
a real father?”
“Do you know who is captain of this vessel?”
“Where does he come from—the end of the world?”
You have a calm, strong mind, Maximilian.
The baron might possibly have perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.
We beg them to take one step backward, and to transport themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes, into the showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was the pride of its owner, Baron Danglars.
“Go and call out your regiment,” said he; “I can foresee that we shall have need of it directly.”
He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it; in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place, he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone.
“Let me kill him.”
At the end of an hour, he heard a faint noise, which increased.
“Yes.”
“Then you advise me to accept?”
“Madame, my friend Du Vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire; but I think I remember that there was a question between him and Monsieur Mazarin as to making his estate a barony.
“Give it to me,” said the duke.
I might have gone up to him and killed him.
“For the king!” cried D’Artagnan.
The deliverance of the cardinal, perhaps.
Milady rushed to the door and opened it.
Around a broken-down carriage the people were uttering imprecations, whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners—that is to say, an old man and two women.
Consider well what you do in that house.
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other.
“Diable!
The woman kneels on a prie-dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl, leaning against a chair, weeping.
At four o’clock D’Artagnan recommenced his journey.
It is you who stabbed Selim.
Porthos, in pronouncing these words, seemed to gulp down something.
“The two things agree marvelously well.”
“Then I may tell you all.
“I would realize——”
“Yes, he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin, his valet-de-chambre, and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la Fere.
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?”
Go, for I see how impatient you are.”
Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up, pushing her away.
Felton,” said Buckingham, “you will withdraw, and place yourself at once under arrest.”
“Aramis.”
“My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,” said Villefort, carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; “and the senator’s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him.
They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced tenderly, and returned together to the house.
“She is called Milady, but she may be French.
“Do you think, then, madame,” replied Felton, in the same serious voice, but with a milder tone, “do you think I assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator?
There was no more to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust.
“I left him five days ago,” said D’Artagnan, and he portrayed with Gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of Porthos in his Chateau of Pierrefonds; nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent Monsieur Mouston.
Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage, and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable.
What could she have done to you?
“What is the matter?
“You see, I do not conceal myself.”
“What Lord Ruthven do you mean?”
“‘How long?’ inquired the astonished merchant.
“’Tis true,” replied D’Artagnan.

At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos started.
“Ah, yes; I see,” said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.

“I have made an agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free of all charge.
“No,” said D’Artagnan; “no, I confess it.
They will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these squibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII., Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period, less faithful than in the history of M.

I will even venture to say that I am certain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event.
Dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon himself, so that the least thing,—a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury.
We have secured him.”
And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain?”
The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon.

“Ah, yes,” said Château-Renaud.
Sometimes he was delirious, and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he, also, was dying of hunger.
At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand’s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows.
He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry, which he pushed aside.
“And what is a Fronde?” inquired Mazarin.

Villefort leaped out of the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return; he could read no other expression on their features.
“Yes, I want your chaise.”
“Yes.”
“If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is worth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred.”
“Here I am in their name,” said M. de Boville; “but did you receive my letter yesterday?”
“Nothing,” replied De Winter; “nothing; and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me——” and he again turned round.
“No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this chase-loving Diana, continually surrounded by her nymphs, gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actæon.”
He only added that on his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent horses—one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern.
“Then,” murmured Louis, “he was well informed.
“Oh!
Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have perished by so dreadful a death.”

While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina, which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli palaces, Franz’s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant.

So to-night, Mordaunt, go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca Lightning.
I have something to say to you.”
Danglars pressed his daughter’s hand in his.
I am a machine then, and nothing else, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.”
Besides, his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven——”
You were rich, noble, held in great esteem—had all that could render a man happy?”

Over a species of altar, and beneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes, was a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its resemblance that D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it.
The most profound terror reigned throughout the house.
All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next—a sublime spot, a resting-place full of poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.
At the end of twelve days, after having made a splendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only 50,000 francs left.

“My friend,” said Andrea, “I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis, when my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.
“Let us go,” said he; “it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment was for eight o’clock.”

Chapter 29.
Old Dantès was dead, and Mercédès had disappeared.
“He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask.
“No, no,” continued D’Artagnan, “it was not the measured step of a foot soldier, nor was it the gait of a horseman.
“Sire,” said Villefort, “your majesty mistakes; this is an officer’s cross.”
“No, that is true; but she—that is another thing; I believe she is detained in France by some love affair.”
“Yes, but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken away.
No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions, hey?”
Then she ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm.
As to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.
Then, as it was cold, he asked for his gown, which was brought to him.
“Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to-night he will sleep better to-morrow night.”
“It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.”
If the window had been open or even ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no—all was hermetically sealed.

In spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love.
Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes, he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap, while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller’s face.
“He was a Catalan.”
The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less preoccupied by that pretty face than D’Artagnan, he had fancied he saw a second head, a man’s head, inside the carriage.
The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could not distinguish a single feature.

Death is about to return to the tomb, the phantom to retire in darkness.”
“Certainly, my lord; he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais Royal.”
The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven; then leaping down from his bed he went to the window, and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside, but in vain.

But Dantès cannot remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and the day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration!”
“Mercédès lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized you when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice, Edmond,—by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she has followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf.”

“He escapes us,” growled Porthos, pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges, but in vain.
So in twelve times you thrice missed the mark.”
“Yes, moderately so.
“What monk?”
The letter from the executioner’s assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected.
A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter.
A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner.
De Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes.
“‘Oh, as to the robbers,’ said Joannes, ‘here is something for them,’ and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle.
“And I deny it,” said Tréville.
“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles!

M. de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de Tréville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really commenced life as D’Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in his pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his.

He was convinced that Lucien’s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.
Morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort’s apartments and to hers.
“Nothing more simple,” returned the count.
If we are not, we shall have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us—for I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will talk of our affairs just the same.
“A nobility of the rope!” said Château-Renaud phlegmatically.
“No, mother,—capital 3,000 francs.

That was five years ago.
“My dear Grimaud, thou speakest seldom, but when thou dost, one must do thee justice—thy words are words of gold.”
“I?” cried Athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder.
“Laugh, then,” said Monsieur de Retz; “they are looking at us.” And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse, who was in the midst of a large group.

“Never.”
Well, I will tell you.
Albert turned.
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not one of those that long remain clear.

“Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted!
“The man I saw go in.”
“It is a poor, lame post-horse.”
He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos’s apartment, and knocked at the door enough to break it down.
“Yes, but he couldn’t understand what it meant, for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his return.”
“To me, sir?” said he.
“As for me,” replied Porthos, “I am falling asleep, which is strange, considering we have not had any fighting; truly the Parisians are idiots.”
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if appearing to have formed a resolution, she said, “I have an enemy.”
It must be the son of Mère Simon who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here this morning.
ESCAPE
If, on the contrary, he refuses to do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret.”

“Pardon me, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Tréville’s clock three-quarters of an hour, “but I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.”
“I have now to confess to you.
really,” said Planchet.
“I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect.”
This time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker’s meaning, it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide.
“Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.”
The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel.
But you are unable to oppose them,—you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself.
Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes.
“Yes, my friend, yes,” said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him; “and as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be indemnified.

At length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which Porthos went to the gaming table.
D’Artagnan then, returning to the officer, said:

“Come in, gentlemen,” repeated the princess, opening the door herself.
“Why did you leave the closet, Monsieur d’Artagnan?” asked the cardinal.
“Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people.
“Well, then, since she has left Paris, and you are sure of it, D’Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow you.
“Valentine,” said Morrel, “death is in itself sacred.”
“‘Then you shall not leave this place,’ said he.
“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance of the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”
“_Ma foi!_” said Château-Renaud, “I would rather end my career like M. de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe.”
Whilst they pursue him the king might escape.”

Come, courage!
Aramis awoke.
One man alone remained in his place, gun in hand.

Ghosts
In the capture of a king, his degradation and his murder.”
“One of my bitterest enemies—the faithful friend of Cardinal Richelieu.”
Most probably Morrel and Château-Renaud returned to their “domestic hearths,” as they say in the gallery of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of the Rue Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with Debray.

The monk’s eyes glittered.
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and mistress as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand of the novice, and devouring her with looks.
“That may be true,” replied Porthos; “but I am used to him, and besides, he wouldn’t be willing to let me go without him, he loves me so much.”
“Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race.”
Albert hesitated a moment.
“And he has no children with all these titles?”

“Madame Danglars is ill,” said Villefort; “it would be better to take her to her carriage.”
“Oh, oh!” thought D’Artagnan.
Business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered.
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.
“No,” said Noirtier.
“M.
“It would make very little difference to me,” said Caderousse, “if I were retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad never to see them again.”
She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his arm, and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted passage, lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone.
“Was it M. de Villefort?”
“He is staying, then, at the Hôtel de Londres with you?”
D’Artagnan, however, who had consulted with Aramis, spoke to the poor wretch.
D’Artagnan lost no time in useless compliments.
It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,” said Porthos.
Why, Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends!” exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him, while the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny.
we have a precious fellow here!”
“That is also possible.
“A voice of strange sweetness?”
What he?” asked Athos.
“To the dungeon, then,” said the corporal.
“And what,” he continued, “has been done with the poor body?”
“Yes, sir,” answered Mousqueton; “but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in it.
Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost.
The pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard.
“What?” asked Athos.
“You confuse me,” replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; “let us talk of something else, if you please.
Gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag.
“You think, then, that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers?” said Gondy.
Pray tell me what you think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some considerable property in their hands.”
D’Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied.
And you?”
And have not all these Fernands, united, made Lieutenant-General, the Count of Morcerf, peer of France?”
I went on first, fortunately.
“I know it well.”
It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but to dream thus forever.
“No,” said Felton; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard.”
He has been here a week, with the instinct of a hound, hunting by himself.
But Villefort, raising his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips.
“Well!
“What is the matter?” asked Milady.
She was charming.
“Oh, pardon me, sir; I can scarcely realize so great a happiness.
Albert, completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo, was sleeping in an armchair near the window, while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house, when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up.
D’Artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau.
“I hope so.”
Nobody knows him.
“With an excellent master-at-arms that we have here.”
“Unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that ‘red is either altogether good or altogether bad.’ The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition.
“It was not he, then, you came to seek?”
“Oh!” he murmured, as he left the threshold of the palace: “ungrateful court!
As soon as she perceived him, she cried, “You have promised your protection; you have promised to save me from her anger.
It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.”
Do you know him, Aramis?”
And Porthos, enchanted at having relieved his mind, rejoined Mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street.
“You know what I have done?”
Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor’s misfortune, and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct, when Athos stopped him.
Oh, he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect!
“But that does not affect the son.”
He admired the strong hands, the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porthos.
I am the most wretched of men.
“Henry,” said Charles, “call me your father.”
Two royal pages were playing with him.
“Well,” said he, “I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;” and he struck out with the energy of despair.
The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise.
“But you forget,” replied Debray, laughing, “that we are Franks by name and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.”
He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps, and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery, asked if the Duchess de Chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere?

When this formality was ended, as her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women alone.
“Go on, my good Parry, I am listening.”
“Well, that woman?”
Steel is for gentlemen.”
be it so!” replied D’Artagnan; “that is exactly what I want.”
“And I,” said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, “I—”
“Do you need money?”
“What,” asked the duke, “what do you mean?” and he gave him the cane again, first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache.
You were not of the party, M. de Morcerf?”
“Indeed?”
Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on.
Monte Cristo gently smiled and said,—“I was there;” at the same time pointing to the corner of a street.
“It is probable,” said Albert.
“It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to England?”
“Can I be deceived?” he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call “the salad basket.”

Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself.

“My first husband!” cried Milady, looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets.

The queen is likely to follow Mazarin’s counsels and to have me tried.”
Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.”
“Courage, we have them!”
Explain yourself, then.”
“And where are they looking for her?”
The Departure for Belgium Chapter 98.
“Aramis!” he cried.
An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de Tréville alone remaining with the wounded.
Then, when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard, and was consequently relieved of doubts, he said:
“What does he appear to be?”
“But we must first learn what convent she is in.”
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced.

“In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let me take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful?”

In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered, and also in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated.
“Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes.

“He has broken his ribs,” said the commander, in a low voice.
“Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.”
Oh, as I told you before, I think the old fellow is very close.”
Scarcely, however, had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to Mazarin:
They might not be satisfied, and——”
Franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini reassured him by saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself, and that it had gone at four o’clock to fetch him from the Rospoli Palace.
“I answer for him,” said the curate.

As the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding, was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew what to expect.
“Well?”
He was of pale complexion, with clear blue eyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained motionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper for poets, enthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which, like the beard which covered the lower part of his face, was of a beautiful deep chestnut color.

What a life I cause you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness!
As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon.
“You think I shall deprive you of those three millions,” said Danglars; “but do not fear it.
“They’ll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,” said Aramis.
As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself.
“And what is become of this Benedetto?”
“The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel,” cried Anne, unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor, whom she looked upon, and probably with reason, as the promoter of the tumult.

Albert de Morcerf is no coward!” said Monte Cristo.
“Still, there have been men who suffered more than you.”
And now, my lord, that I see how hopeless the position of the king is, tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband.”
“’Tis he, past all doubt.”
Aramis returned home, and Athos and D’Artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire.
I had fixed the embarkation for the twenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be.

“I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.”
“That’s it!” said D’Artagnan, “I had forgotten that he was only a Musketeer for a time.”
He did not look like an executioner.”
“Then, in these trunks——”
“It is the voice of—”
“But will no one remain in the house, my lord?” asked Baptistin.
The English, repulsed foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame.

Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited.
and a large sum!” said Mazarin.
“A little,” said Mazarin, trembling, lest Anne should ask to draw upon his purse.
Come now, what are you telling me?”
“Ah!
“No.”

“Oh, it’s nothing, nothing!” cried Milady.
“No mercy, sir!
But you, my dear Athos—you, who so generously distributed the Englishman’s pistoles, which were our legitimate property—what do you mean to do?”
“I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,” said the priest.
I don’t believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads, for heads are not taken off without previous trial; a trial would make a noise, and a noise would get the attention of our friends, who would check the operations of Monsieur de Mazarin.”
And what may be that description?”
“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”

“Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were good-hearted, and I was mistaken!
“Don’t you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell, who, to make sure of this affair, undertook it himself?”
“What does you mean by boor Michon?” said the Swiss, who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came.
“I certainly am surprised,” replied M. de Tréville, “that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor Béarnese.”
“Yes, sire.”
As Dantès (his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d’If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor’s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.
Besides, although she avoided coming within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she managed, unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at the young man, which seemed to say, “Have patience!

“Where do we go first?”
She is what the English call a yacht.”
She turned toward the wall to smile—for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.
They were anxious about you here; I simply told them where you were.
And Athos—I don’t see Athos.
It is he who in an encounter with your Eminence’s Guards decided the victory in favor of the king’s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De Wardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried off, has sworn my death.”
Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantès,—the latter of whom attracted universal notice.

Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he paused, and then said, “At what o’clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready?”
“It is but Christian charity,” replied D’Artagnan, “not to lead one’s neighbors into temptation.”
“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to release me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is all I ask.

I call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one’s hand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as France, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks, speculations of the day—in fact, all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions.
“Oh, that naughty child!
“Ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “I see that I am condemned to die!”

“Haydée,” said he, “did you read it?”
Now, these reflections had led him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to decline when, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge.
More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service.
He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then, when he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler’s abandoning his purse to save his life.

“I was waiting for you, sir,” said Mordaunt, raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe.

28;’ it is indeed the same,” said he; “and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror?
that is of the first importance.”
“Yes, monsieur, it is here he lives,” the servant replied to Planchet, who was not in livery.
“It was.”
“Well, what is it?”

I set out three days ago, passing miraculously through the Puritan army, and I took post horses with my servant Tony; the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris.
Each had his own particular visit to make.
“Fall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,” said D’Artagnan, likewise to himself, “after having abused me with such effrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill.”
“My dear fellow, I mistrust women.
Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in two seconds reappeared, bringing on a tray, all that his master had ordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground, like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales.
Now victory has abandoned him.
“Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with powder.
“You know well that I don’t like to leave things half finished.”
“Exactly; therefore I think of sending him away from here.”
He understood that they had described a circle, and were bringing him back to Rome.
During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts.
“Ah!
I will go straight to the Louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king’s Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal’s Guards, and if he refuses me, _morbleu!_ I will turn abbé.”
“I had it from Aramis,” replied the Musketeer.
Then he said to himself:
“And the cursed Italian?”
“You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage.
“Bad,” replied Athos, “very bad.”
“Go, sir,” said the queen; “I will follow you.”
He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures, that the count, like himself, had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart.
As we have seen, therefore, he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition, but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity.

“From Master Bazin, to be sure; he took you for the devil, my dear fellow, and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers.”
“No, I shall go incognito, count, under the name of Marie Michon.”
“I do not know,” replied Dantès.
“As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen’s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place.
“Yes.”
The queen was standing in the room, pale with anger; her self-control, however, was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm.
Ali reappeared.
“You see, cardinal,” replied the queen, “that your enemies are mine.”
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin, who was running breathlessly.
What could they desire beyond their liberty?
“I!
“No!” replied D’Artagnan, “deuce take it, the campaign is going to begin; I wish to be there, I expect to get something by it.”
“Oh, I cannot behold this frightful spectacle!” said he.
Vampa took Cucumetto’s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.
He remained there some time alone.
He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
“What would you have me say?”
“Ah, indeed?” said Danglars; “and where was that?”
“She only speaks Romaic.”
“Oh, may God keep me from it, and you, too!” said D’Artagnan.
“Sir,” interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos, “if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen.
Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them.
The moment for my escape is fixed—seven o’clock.
When the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa quite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:
“What is his name?”
“Hold, madame,” said Porthos, “let us say no more upon the subject, I beg of you.
I swear to you, sir, should any harm befall me, your name will be the last name that I shall utter, the remembrance of you my last thought.”
“It does not matter; and a few of those bottles of old Burgundy wine, which cured your master so quickly of his sprain!”
“Now, retire to your chambers,” said Athos, “and leave me to act.
All still remained silent, the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared, endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness.
The eyes of Porthos were furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the nave.
At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor.
Port Wine.
“It is to throw ourselves into the wolf’s jaws,” said Aramis.
“Very well,” said Porthos, “we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms.”
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they bowed their heads in sign of assent.
“Well, what do you want?”
But have the kindness to give the Abbé Busoni——”
“Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.”
“Her very self; she gave it me last night.
As for you, you have acted like a barmaid.
1.F.2.
“Yes,” said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; “and as what I say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost, should be sorry if anything happened to Dantès—the worthy Dantès—look here!” And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor.
D’Artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet, but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it.
De Tréville knows him and esteems him very highly, and De Tréville, as you know, is one of the queen’s greatest friends.
The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous.
It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection.
Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details Morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt sure that he must be on the Appian Way.
Delightful!
“Mordioux!” answered D’Artagnan, “I believe we must.
“Wait,” said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated, “Wa—We—Wi——” The old man stopped her at the last syllable.
my lord—escape!
Battles, long journeys, blows given and received, sufficed for the first themes of conversation, which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal.
Oh, ungrateful girl that I am,” cried Valentine, sobbing, “I will give up all, even my dear old grandfather, whom I had nearly forgotten.”
“What do you mean?”

“Constance.”
Many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run, first men, then groups, and then a crowd of people; hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it; but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage.
“A name?
I have made him a spy upon his wife.”
On my right I saw the tree, behind me the rock.
“I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was coming back from Algiers,” said Château-Renaud; “she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body.
It is not at all amusing here; there is not a single woman passing.”
“The count awaits your excellency.”
“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she loves another man better than her husband?
“Not yet,” replied Porthos.
At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter.
The procureur?”
“Bah,” replied Monte Cristo, “impossible!”
“Well, in my absence haven’t I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman?
You are inclining toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost.”
“Yes, madame.”
“Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it; and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness.”
“All I can say is,” continued the countess, taking up the _lorgnette_, and directing it toward the box in question, “that the gentleman, whose history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human.
“No.”
“Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him.
The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo.
I will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should know you, as he is to pay your money.”
“Everything goes as if in flowery paths.”
“No; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.”
“I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,” said the gendarme, “but I know we are taking you to the Château d’If.
“He will come in here, and M. Morrel had better go,—do you not think so, grandpapa?”
Halloo, Grimaud!”
“Come,” added the king.
“Well, Laporte?” asked the queen.
“I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family: and to set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I am, may follow.”

Now, for my part, I met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me, if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from.
Yes, the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow, any hour,” continued she, throwing a significant glance at Porthos.
“To the tower Saint Jacques la Boucherie;” and delighted with the success of his embassy, Friquet started off at the top of his speed.
“Sir,” said Aramis, “you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner.
D’Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he could be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber, together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined, and the word “Majesty” several times repeated, indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen’s apartment.
It was now Athos who turned pale.
He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a tomb, and sought it vainly.
The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it.
“Ah!” cried Blaisois, “he is lost!”

“But my orders.”
“The second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my strength began to abandon me.
Do you understand me?” cried Monte Cristo.
“In beauty or on the contrary?” asked Aramis, laughing.
If a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker’s feet, he could not have experienced greater terror.
Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters.
“La Chesnaye,” said the king, “let someone go instantly and find Monsieur de la Trémouille; I wish to speak with him this evening.”
The sentinel opened the door; it was a new face.
The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès.
“But where is Louise?” asked the comte.
A moment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her little Edward.
D’Artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick, where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier.
A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking of hinges was audible.

“Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste.”
It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had escaped by swimming.
“Take some,” she said.
“Listen,” he said; “today is the 5th of September, is it not?”
“By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do more than permit, I exhort you.”
Madame de Villefort, however, reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass.
So, after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply, La Ramee, fascinated by this sobriety in speech, rubbed his hands and engaged Grimaud.
The vessel did touch at Elba, where he quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island.
One believes readily what he wishes to believe.
Villefort had never been so concise and eloquent.
The animal uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its destination, it crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless.
“‘Wait whilst I light the lamp,’ said La Carconte; ‘it is growing dark, and there may be some mistake.’ In fact, night had come on during this conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half-hour.
“No, I will go and speak to him myself.” Morrel went out, called Baptistin, and whispered a few words to him.
It was not to meet me that he came, for he was ignorant of my journey.

I looked into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so that I could not see the expression of his countenance—neither should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was buried between his two hands.
De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been; he rose, dignified and calm, restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man.
“Has it ever happened to you?” said Monte Cristo.
And D’Artagnan set the example.
Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all.”
“Monsieur de Cavois.”
Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time.
Raoul trembled, lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse, for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy, but either instinctively, or from affection for the duchess, he said everything in her favor.
“Remember,” chimed in La Carconte, “those two could crush you at a single blow!”
The Corsican, who had declared the vendetta against me, who had followed me from Nîmes to Paris, who had hid himself in the garden, who had struck me, had seen me dig the grave, had seen me inter the child,—he might become acquainted with your person,—nay, he might even then have known it.
The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.
“Do you hear what he says, major?”
“Go, demon, do what thou wilt!
“Your orders are very simple,” he said; “don’t allow anybody, except one person, to enter here.
However, this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience.”
He was immediately recognized as one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.
“Ah, indeed?” said d’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to you”—Noirtier did not let him finish.
Instead of going direct to his study, M. Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment quitting.
“Oh,” said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!”
“I recommend you to be prudent.”
“And you, Aramis, are you of that opinion?”
“It is he, then.”
“She is in prison?”
Then the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man.
One alone is left to me, but he is one of those known, I believe, to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak.”
Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal, the passing to and fro of busy people?
Bertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received, he started the same evening.
There, as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped, if but for two days, luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease.
The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.
“Oh, my dear count,” said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and wristbands, “you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the carriage, and in the next for this visit,” and he put out his hand to the count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did give it.
He is pursued.’ But where is he?
Everything that savors of mystery charms them.
The Fifth of October
“Sister, sister,” said Maximilian, coming to the count’s aid, “monsieur is quite right.
Franz took it with a nervous trembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”
You will say that I keep it.”
“‘“Because, sir,” said the president, “you have insulted a man, and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation.”
I repeat my words, Aramis, and then, if you desire it, and if they desire it, let us separate forever from our old friends.”
Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie.
“Look!” said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen.
He arose and bowed to the four friends, whose eyes were fixed on Charles, while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving.
The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great, and retired.
Mercédès drew near, and plucked the fruit.
The baron came forward.
It was day.
Desire the French attendants not to weary her with questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire.
At other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child’s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother’s voice when she enjoined me to silence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given.
In the meantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a prisoner can wish for.

“Oh!
“Finish, then, what you were about to say.”
“You speak charmingly,” said Porthos.
“He who has negotiated these matters (forgive me if I begin by speaking of myself, but I must claim that importance which has been given to me, not assumed by me) he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal, ought, it appears to me, in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty, to be made commandant of the guards—an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers.”
“Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be satisfied!
“You will appear at this ball?”
What interest have they in your death?
“Constance, Constance!” cried D’Artagnan.
Mousqueton is here, then?”
In short, his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the rest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation.
I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do.
This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti.
At the voice of this last speaker, Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow.
“Were our object money only,” he said, “we should be rich directly.”
“And why among us four?” inquired Caderousse.
“Their masters are dead!
They had formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded.
“Something better still, Mouston.”

“Eh, _parbleu!_—they should kill me.”
He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began to disappear.
Grimaud nodded assent.
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto,—Villefort having retired as well as Noirtier and d’Avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard.
“Are you not a Christian?” he said, falling on his knees.

Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl’s heart.
It advanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam.
Alas, would I could weep like you!”
He is called Bragelonne.
The president resumed:
“What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence?”
I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches.
“He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.”
“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will, we are sure, meet with your approbation.”
“Where?”
At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed.
“But who is _she?_”
“Shall we take our valets?”
“The count would do as I do,” replied Raoul, urging his horse vigorously forward.
A deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris; but she not only declined to receive the deputies, but sent an intimation by Chancellor Seguier, implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel, Paris would be besieged the very next day.
“How?” said Albert.
You shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine; and I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us.”
“In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.”
“I do not understand you,” said Debray with freezing coldness.
“Oh, she _did_ love me!”
He had scarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed.
The cavalier addressed some words in English to his sister.
“Will you drink some of this ether and water?”
It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort left the Palais.
But what astonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano’s description as a fable, was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.

Speak, or no absolution!”
“No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue de Tournon.”
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who did not appear in the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.
He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done.
D’Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like that of Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without adding another word.

He is dead, and no mistake about it.”
This uneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf’s adventure had made in the world, for the affair at the Opera was generally known.

He leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat and waistcoat, he put on a sailor’s jacket and hat, from beneath which rolled his long black hair.
“Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?”
“That his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur d’Artagnan is waiting for you in the stables.”

They will be ten times worse off in a week.”
“Certainly.”
Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling.
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their effect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.

Danglars, raving, threw himself on the goat-skin.

But although her voice—sweet, full, and sonorous—vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut.
She saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.
The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer.
“Take care, Raoul!
“This is the case,” said D’Artagnan; “this is your brother, Madeleine; you don’t know him perhaps, but I know him; he has arrived from Amsterdam.

Porthos rose, always ready for this kind of adventure.

“Yes.”
“Ah!” said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton’s steps, which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter; “at length you are mine!”
“A proof?” cried Milady; “I will have ten.”
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter.
“Read?” he said.
“No, but it may be sent in something else.”
“Your Eminence is right,” replied Milady; “and I have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is—that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your Eminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by Madame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other than the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens, with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place, and portraits of the actors who figured in them; that Montague is in the Bastille, and that the torture may make him say things he remembers, and even things he has forgotten; that you possess a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse, found in his Grace’s lodging, which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it, but her in whose name it was written.

“I left it where I found it, monsieur.
“And why?”
“Indeed,” said Albert, “it is exquisite; it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does.

“Prodigiously,” replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades.
“A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an ample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier, step by step—this is uncommon; then become general, peer of France, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed, is praiseworthy,—nay, more, it is sublime.”
A poet is as good as an abbé.
And do you believe he knew you again, Kitty?”
“Endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut off your ears as you run.”
Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek, which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance, that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence.
You are poor, are you not?” Then he added to himself: “These English Revolutionists are all beggars and ill-bred.”

“Presently, presently,” cried the latter, “when you haven’t your cloak on.”
The brand disappeared; the beauty alone remained.
The door was wide open, a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of the yard—a strange sight before so noble a mansion; the count looked at it with terror, but without daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed towards his apartment.
Château-Renaud looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and Château-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.

“Apropos, are we to speak of your friends also, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis?
Do not open the pie till you are alone.
“My Lord, I have not named her!” interrupted the young man, warmly.

The host, his mind at ease about his bill, placed pen, ink and paper upon the table.
D’Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive.
“No; I should only regret if the horse had not proved good.”

Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s couch.
“I will suppose anything you please.”
Vampa then rushed towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his betrothed.
Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz.
This answer, and especially the tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor Morrel.

We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France, if we are not poisoned or killed before then.”
He was alone—alone with these countless, these unheard-of treasures!
Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning, he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms, then withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who had been writing at his desk, bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window.
Athos, on quitting Aramis, went to Madame de Chevreuse.
Then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to him, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near to one of the loopholes.

Is he still amusing himself in Italy?”
“‘Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!’
“Well, it is not that the man is more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, M. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind.
She is the prettiest little creature in the world, with flaxen hair, blue eyes,—at once saucy and languishing.”
But come, I am waiting for you.”
“Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground floor, my boy.”
Dantès is a good fellow; I like Dantès.
“Who is this creature?”
“Still,” said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant, “if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for a notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.” Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted.
“But,” said the baroness, “I thought you never put the money out to interest.”

He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor.
Bonacieux, with some embarrassment, “the cause of this event?”
“Spain is her country,” replied D’Artagnan; “and it is very natural that she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil as herself.
He drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing with a pistol.
She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied—justice not being one of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage.

“Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count, who has all our lives in his hands?
This child lives, and someone knows it lives—someone is in possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is in possession of our secret.”
“My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus,” said Morcerf.
“But the man who was under him?”
Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth?’
“He must be apprehended.”
Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos, whilst Athos approached D’Artagnan.
“Everything!” replied Athos.
He was less stiff than formerly.
The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire.
If my brow be severe, it is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified, it is that it might sustain the blows it has received.

If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle.”
“Yes, my lord, like yourself!” said the queen, ironically.
“I am,” replied the latter, gravely.
Mazarin was large in promises,—quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee; for he said nothing and did much.
“Yes, I am going; may you be happy, monsieur,” and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out.
As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.

“But what the devil!
“It is an old man’s caprice!”
“You will promise not to betray me?”
For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word.
Are we not eating a horse, Porthos?
“What do you want?”
A circle was formed around them.
“There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”
As to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dantès’ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt.
“How can it be otherwise, my dear Bonacieux?” replied D’Artagnan; “trust me, I am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct, and if, as I told you, I can be of any service to you—”
I can take you on my shoulders, and swim for both of us.”
“Alas!” continued Athos, “the poor abbé was not a St. Ambroise, and I repeat, Marie Michon was an adorable creature.”
“Not the least in the world.”
I content myself with saying: Command, monseigneur; I am ready.”

I bear the traces of our friendship—three slits or slashes from your sword.”
“Today.”
The count’s well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police, whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice.
As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.
“My good friend,” said the man in the cloak, “excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act.”
“Bah,” said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.”
“In prison, sire.”
He filled two glasses, and by a sign invited D’Artagnan to drink.
The two friends, recalled by D’Artagnan to what was also due to Porthos, pressed his hand in their turn.
“What rank did he hold on board?”
“Nothing is impossible,” replied Milady, “to true love.”
Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon accidents!
Mazarin turned again to his papers.
So call me Mercédès, if you please.”
“Where did the army cross the Lys?”
Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a cry.

Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that D’Artagnan and Porthos might enter.
Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye of a jealous woman, Mme.
You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d’Épinay, and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed.
“And what are his claims to the peerage?”
“You insist?”
“In that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same; you have still your beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure, still your feminine hands, which are admirably suited to a prelate.”
Louis XIII.
“To be sure!” answered Danglars.
“Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.”
I stood in the same attitude, and threw myself down.
“You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,” replied Franz.
“Ah, I have come now to what is most difficult.”

Dantès was alone in darkness and in silence—cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead.
Well, sir, you ought to know that we no longer have a police, since we are no longer at Paris.”

Speak freely.
“In my trunks?
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “it is half past four, and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six.”

This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard, ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Conti’s lieutenant.
“We are all mortal, my poor friends.”
All his sorrows, all his sufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter.
Political judgments are generally vain formalities, for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation.
“What,” cried Athos, “are you selling my horse—my Bajazet?
“Inflexible man!” she murmured.
“I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold to the terms of the agreement.”
“Egad,” said D’Artagnan, “the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren; you are a happy man, my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase, but acquired that of fishing.”

A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers, and pointing to the bench where his enemies were: “Fire on that bench!” he cried.
“A marchioness!”
Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides, without effect; sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth.

“Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.”
“You lie,” said the Abbé Busoni, with a tone of irresistible authority.
D’Artagnan almost leaped with joy.
Milady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the door as it opened.
At midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard.
The warm pressure made D’Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that fever which consumed Milady attacked himself.

He kept himself upright and dreamed, without sleeping.
“In that case I can give you proofs.”
“Oh!” exclaimed Athos, “here it is, as clear as day; pursued as he was, D’Artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely, which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping.”

“That depends; when do you leave?”
This is something new,” replied the king.
At the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had consulted young Maximilian’s taste.

“Friend,” he said, “you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune, that, at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours, it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by Aramis, whose cunning you know—a cunning which, we may say between ourselves, is not always without egotism; or by Athos, a noble and disinterested man, but blase, who, desiring nothing further for himself, doesn’t sympathize with the desires of others.

“Besides, we can but blow out his brains if he proves false,” said the Gascon; “and you, Athos, you know something of everything and can be our captain.
The baroness was also surprised, and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations.

Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife—delightful!
“That’s true,” said Athos; “we must wait for Aramis.”
The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest touch; and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding.
“No, my Lord, I still plead.
Go.”
“Sir,” said Planchet, “I am in all things at your service.”

Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped; his energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue.
“Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me.”
“Yes, it is I,” said D’Artagnan, “it is I, whom God has sent to watch over you.”
The mercer had said that he was rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M. Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love, which had been the consequence of it.
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face, framed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was icy impassibility.

“Just like the women,” replied D’Artagnan, coolly.
“But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing—”

The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand.
“I fight in the cause of honor.”
“Are you ready?”
He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.
“By my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!” said D’Artagnan, with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it.
Bravo, bravo!”
Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated herself.
Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear the table, and that Felton would then reappear.

At the same time through the streets of Grenelle, Saint Honore, and Du Coq, a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthos’s horse and that of D’Artagnan.
Aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in Athos’s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords.
I must speak to him about it.”
Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge.
“Yes?”
Another pause.
Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping bitterly.
Moreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is such, is betrayed to you alone.

Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees, Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue.

They had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village, the red-tiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them, when, coming toward them mounted on a mule, they perceived a poor monk, whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an Augustine brother.
“Madame,” said La Meilleraie, “do not say too much against him before me, for the service he rendered me is still fresh.”
The lady with the red cushion produced a great effect—for she was very handsome—upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon D’Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of Dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the name of Milady.
Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired.
“The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the king’s service, who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers.”

“Don’t be alarmed, Valentine—it is I!”
“Here they are!
“She.”
“Indeed!” said D’Artagnan, “monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy.
Standing well at court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch, whether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly supported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de Villefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a Molé.
The coadjutor went to him and held out his hand.
“Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money?
Whither art thou going, Grimaud?”

He dressed entirely in black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush.
D’Arminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses, and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion.
“Or, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!” replied the prisoner, with a smile of incredulity.
Now, as I am not egotistical, we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.’
Aramis smiled.
The procureur, without going to see either his wife or his daughter, went at once to his study, and, offering the young man a chair:
Mordaunt reappeared.
“I mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not, by her infamy, soil an unblemished name; that she shall not, with one blow, dishonor her husband and her child.”
“Yes,” was the unanimous answer.
“I believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate her.”

During this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease.
“Then, if I should require more,” continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner, “why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned.

“Maximilian,” said the count, “you should not look on the graves, but there;” and he pointed upwards.
Coquenard gently advised him to be patient.
I still assist at executions, but no longer strike the blow myself—no, indeed.”
“Ah, indeed?” said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000 francs—“ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.”
Andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to Provençal kitchens of an inferior order, added to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk and cloves.
As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains.
They ask my age; I tell it.
“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?” asked d’Avrigny.
But to return to what we were saying.
ah!” said Gondy, reflecting, “you are right, sir; some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris; some one who would know how to cry aloud to them, that all France might hear it, that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty.”
“What sort of men?”
“Really, he is by no means a light load!” said the other bearer, sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow.
The Skiff “Lightning.”
“For what purpose?”
“You hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,” said the countess.
“Are we then to go to war?”
I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”
“Yes, yes, indeed.”
“Do you think of dying, my lord?” said she.
“Let us go, then,” said Athos.
There are moments when a man grows young again in his children.”
“Besides,” said Aramis, “God desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner.”
“No, for it would be useless.
“I?
“Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two shadows.”
Wild dreams had disturbed his repose.
“Yes.”
I had no doubt he would return the following night.
Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste.
Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window.
“I have no doubt of it.”
“That’s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?”
“But if he doesn’t return?”
I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in truth—I was not attending to the conversation.”
“By her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,” continued D’Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.
From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous.
After which your majesty will, I think, no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf.”
“I think so, truly; my nurse lives there.”
Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not dared to sleep a single instant.
And yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps might succeed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body?
“Now,” said the steward, “what have you to tell me?”
Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening.
At this moment the coadjutor was announced; a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage.
Mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristo’s eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for, doubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them—far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir.
The black horses of the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most strict incognito.
The pleasure of seeing you.
“Not likely,” answered the Gascon; “these marks are regular.”
The fair Indian approached Scarron.
“Not at all,” said D’Artagnan; “I am precisely of the contrary opinion.”
“Sire, sire,” murmured the minister, “for pity’s——”
Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve.
“Yes, since she lives.”
“You are a perfect Amazon, Eugénie!” And the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.
My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict me.”
“Lord, who can say, monsieur?
To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee—that is good for the king’s Musketeers!”
Oh, sir, in pity send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy.”
At six in the evening the guests began to come.
“Be on the qui vive!” cried D’Artagnan.
Allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.”
“But whence have you obtained them?”
“The Maréchale d’Ancre was no more than the Maréchale d’Ancre.
How could I pronounce that word?
No; I hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.”
He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him.
“It is my father, who has just left his study.”
“My friend, I think that he is much troubled with gout.”
“Monsieur Porthos, be generous!”
But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health.
A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd.
I could not have killed her by the same blow,—I should have fled from my country.”
Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian funds.
The blow was sped by D’Artagnan; the rapier had pierced his bosom.
50125m
“What matters that?” muttered Fernand.
“Ah, indeed!
you are the chevalier’s prisoner.”
“And he told you nothing?”
You can understand that one of two things must have happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow, from a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he must have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom, where he remained—poor fellow!”

“Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal; let me know always where to find you.”
Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine, Grimaud hastened to awake D’Artagnan, who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place.
“That is well; God has made them senseless,” said Felton.
“Courage!” cried Raoul, “courage!”
“What would you have?
I actually love no one, sir; you know it, do you not?
“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching brain.
“Faith, no.”
But what can they intend to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?”
Vampa measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him.
Once more, let me thank you, my good friends, both in my own name and the queen’s.”
“What?
“I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too late.”
“How is that?”
This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly.
“It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said Beauchamp.
“He is not a gossip, I hope?”
“Take this,” said Madame de Villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to Valentine.
If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman.”
The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row.
At the end of the jetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary with him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.
“All this will be cleared up at a later period,” murmured the young woman; “no, monsieur, be silent.”
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, “if I recollect well what you said, it was nothing out of the common way.”
Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty.
“These cannot be for us,” said Athos.
Ten minutes afterward she was at home.
The count followed them with his eyes, his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth, whose height was almost equal to his own; but as soon as they were out of sight he said:
“Ah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation.”
“Don’t you see them?” cried Friquet, “don’t you see?
the king?
He instantly retired, from a feeling of respectful delicacy; it was, however, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both Comminges and the other officers on horseback.
Oh!
IN FRANCE
“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “you promised me never to mention that circumstance.”
“Absent.”
Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in Providence?
“Far from here?” asked Athos.
“Yes,” replied De Comminges, “more especially if it could reveal how Monsieur d’Artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him.”
“No; neither do I wish to incur guilt.
To the scaffold with the poisoner—to the scaffold!
“It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has secluded himself.
“Well, well,” said M. Morrel, “I know there was no one in fault but destiny.
The count was silent, but continued to gaze around him.
With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved; then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony, leaning over the balustrade, waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room.
Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours.
“‘The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd, being the first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza del Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named Don César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band.
Albert, in his turn, sat behind.
“Athos,” said the king, mechanically; “yes, certainly I know that name.”
“And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father’s conduct,” added the incorrigible marquise.

In a moment, thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a key.
There is our wine in bottles, and our wine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and sausages.
“Nothing.”
I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene.
“Are you aware, my lord, that mendacity is an organized body, a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything; an association in which every one takes his share; one that elects a leader?”
“To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,” said the procureur.
With much pleasure, your excellency, if it would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for.
“What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?” said he eagerly.
“I am uneasy about Blaisois,” said Athos; “he can, he says, only swim in rivers.”
“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.
A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law.
“My faith!” said the young man, laughing, “I confess it, and so much more the readily, my dear Bonacieux, as I see there is no concealing anything from you.
“It was all up with him,” continued Aramis; “ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly.”
Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil.
“Porthos,” replied Aramis, “I have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to you among the women.”
Almost instantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry, seven or eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators, passed by like lightning.
“Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us.”
I did not lose sight of him for an instant.
“Here, monseigneur,” said Aramis, “is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Frondeurs.
0197m
Submit this honour to somebody else.” And he sat down.
Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you are not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?”
“Yes.”
All at once he raised his head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten, and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him, he shrilled it twice.
There are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand.
“Good!
This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.
“A friend!” responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry, he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first, saluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.
“Oh, monsieur!” said Planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and moreover, terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “our presence here is the best proof of former friendship; not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous; not one has, therefore, to reproach himself.”
“The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does it not?”
“No, no; I go, I depart!
“Yes; I am a man of honor,” said D’Artagnan, determined to come to an end, “and since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it—for I do possess it, do I not?”
“I?—I kill my boy?” cried the distracted mother, rushing toward Villefort; “I kill my son?
At this last thought Mercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.’
(Do not try, my lord, you cannot guess who it is; all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned.)
“Let us entice them away.”
my nephew is not yet king, and you know Laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything.”
“Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence.
“And now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you?” asked D’Artagnan.
This was M. Morrel’s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually frightened.
“And——”
Had not government better profit by it?
“The monk!” exclaimed Grimaud.
Finally he slept.
“That is true,” said Porthos
de Sévigné.
“Certainly.”
Not a second was to be lost.
Tell them she was my beloved, my noble girl, my only blessing in the world.
As on the evening before, the soldier stopped his march to listen to her.
“You are a wonderful man, my dear count,” said Aramis; “you think of everything.”
The terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass.
“Do you talk in your sleep?”
Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird.
The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired, never doubting but that the order had come from his master.
As the night before, D’Artagnan did not return home till five o’clock in the morning.
As soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.
It was Noirtier the lemonade was intended for—it is Noirtier, logically speaking, who drank it.
“‘Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.’
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peter’s, and a month to study it.
“Aramis,” cried Athos, “I am arrested.”
For part of the day he went into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun.
“By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.”
D’Artagnan smiled; this jealous anger of Milady was his revenge.
“Do you think so?” said Aramis, smiling; “it is possible.
“Yes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected.”
on!” cried D’Artagnan; “all goes well!
“If I bore my proper title I should be a lord.
“Do you mean at Rome?”
“That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.”
He hired the apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few hours in the day there, and rarely slept there.
“You well know, my lord, that there always remains to us a last resource.”
“Yes, three on horseback and three who have dismounted.”
“Then I went out of the house; I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready.
I am fifteen years younger than he is.
You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”
“And this,” said Monte Cristo, “is your opinion of your intended spouse?”
I live, because it is not ordained for me to die.
“Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars?”
I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano’s.”
Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to D’Artagnan, to the great astonishment of the young man.
You are young.
I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me.
After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom.
There was neither dining, nor playing at cards, nor dancing in that house.
She felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity.
“The notary!” she exclaimed, “let him come in.”
“‘I accept it,’ answered the traveller, ‘but then the obligation will be on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.’
“Then there is no longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to the galleys?”
And M. de Villefort, giving the key to d’Avrigny, again bade farewell to the strange doctor, and retired to his study, where he began to work.
“There is the wounded man,” said De Guiche, passing close to the Augustine brother.
“P.S.—I sign my full name, for I should be vain if I could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials.”
“But did you not read that I must be alone?” said Julie.
“We are going to execute your wishes.”
Rest content with my friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will promise no more than I can bestow.”
Eugénie approached softly, and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge.
“Nothing, my dear,” replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question,—“nothing, only I want it.”
20311m
This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak.
“But, tell me, what do you ask?”
“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”
Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal, beginning, as a matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall of the Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”), to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded, Franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column, and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.
“‘On whom?’
“_Mon dieu!_” cried Danglars, “we are not returning to Rome; then it is not justice which is pursuing me!
“It is true—the queen is for him.”
‘Go,’ said he; ‘the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your service.
“Monsieur de Cavois?”
At this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage, and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other.
“Now, Monsieur Porthos, once more, and this is the last!
He found him kneeling before a _priedieu_, with his head leaning on an open prayer book.
The young man’s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie.
She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he knew.
“What, with the baroness?”
“How is it arranged?”
Notwithstanding that assurance, Morrel still hesitated.
The history of Athos’s imprisonment was then related to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the host in the wrong.
Athos made two visits in Paris; at seven o’clock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles; it was stopped by porters, horses and footmen.
“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,” replied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.
“Well!” cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, “this man must be the devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a specter.”
“Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor, Caderousse.
“Poor, dear woman,” said Debray, “she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself or friends.
Do not believe what Albert is telling you, countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever.
“Pistols, then, at eight o’clock, in the Bois de Vincennes,” said Beauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.
This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing,—a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper.
I was without a light in that room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I continually expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled.
“You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked?
“Good; he accepts,” said Monte Cristo.
“Oh!” said D’Artagnan, “we don’t now make war as we did formerly.
“Let us try and overtake this gentleman,” said Raoul to Olivain; “like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company.”
I do!” replied Athos, with a deep sigh.
This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh, such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.
“_Ma foi_, no,” returned Albert.
It was Mercédès leaning on her son’s arm and leaving the house.
“Speak, then, I am all attention.”
“Well?” inquired Dantès.
“Sire!” interposed Laporte, in order to turn the subject, “to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle?”
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the young lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron.
“Mademoiselle,” said Franz, turning towards Valentine, “unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age.” Valentine remained dumb and motionless.
“We met in the Place Royale—Egad!
Now, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted.
I hoped your house would have been some other one than this; as if there was not another house at Auteuil than that of the assassination!”
“Coysel is a madman!” returned the cardinal.
“Flying through an army, sire,” said Athos, “in all countries in the world is called charging.”
“Ah, ah!” said D’Artagnan, half rising and bowing; “you are my landlord?”
Rise and answer.”
I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you, I can scarcely stand.”
“Oh, monsieur,” cried Dantès, “you have been rather a friend than a judge.”
What matters it about Broussel—it is a name, not a thing.”
I became very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a reply, but could find none—I was silent.
“I don’t understand,” said Porthos.
“Yes, let us drink,” said Athos, anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with D’Artagnan, “let us drink and get away from this hateful country.
“And old age?”
“‘Baron Danglars.’”
It was forty-eight hours since I had taken any nourishment.
the devil!”
“Then what do you fear, my lord?”
“Cæs...ar † Spada.”
It was that of a number of men steadily approaching.
“Very well,” cried D’Artagnan, at last, furious, “very well, since you wish it, let us leave our bones in this beggarly land, where it is always cold, where fine weather is a fog, fog is rain, and rain a deluge; where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese; in truth, whether we die here or elsewhere matters little, since we must die.”
His Musketeers proceeded and followed him.
Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantès’ venture.
“It is well.
“Fourteen years!” he muttered.
“What is he aiming at?” murmured the queen, looking uneasily at the cardinal.
We have all wished for this interview, and I trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your objections to Valentine’s marriage.”
“You, madame!” said D’Artagnan, affecting surprise; “is that possible, my God?—good and beautiful as you are!”
“Ah!
“Not at all.
“Monsieur is a Gascon?” asked Aramis.
Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord.
“Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?” pursued the notary.
“To be sure, to see you.
“What are you doing here?” he asked in a lofty tone, as that of one accustomed to command.
Athos, according to his system, neither encouraged nor dissuaded him.
The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides.
Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion, and regained with hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses.
When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton approaching.
High heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is longsighted.”
“Yes, madame; I have that of the Garter, which King Charles I. gave me some days before he died.”
Well, I swear to you, all three, that had the executioner of Bethune—was he not of Bethune?—yes, egad!
“I will remember it,” said the young man, “as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid.
And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and offered him his hand.
“It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,” said Villefort, “though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but I am the more annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood.”
“So far, well,” said Athos, “I perceive you know me.”
At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.
At ten o’clock Anne of Austria had entered the king’s room.
“I know you well now,” said the executioner; “you were one of the four grooms.”
“He is rich, then?”
They began by walking through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes instead of furniture.
Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover.
“You are right, Aramis, let us travel on.”
“Capital!
It is not of him that I am now thinking.
“You must have searched badly.”
“And who is with madame?—M.
A bargain was therefore struck.
He told me—let me think—what was it?
“I shall be baron!” explained Porthos, stepping forward.
“Yes; Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented.
“However well disposed a person may be, why, you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last old Dantès was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” continued the cardinal, “you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign.”
“My stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback.
“Yes,” said the prince, “if you will serve me as guide.”
“Both.”
“Start, start!” said D’Artagnan.
Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half-past six.
The chancellor made a profound reverence.
“Her?”
The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous bouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle.
What time do you breakfast, Albert?”
I am come to talk to you about a thousand things; but, first tell me, were you going out or just returned?”
“At the foot of the cardinal’s gallows.”
“Monsieur, you insult the majesty of justice.”
At the third he fell again.
In one was depicted the “Illustrious Coxcomb” receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio, whose servant he had been; another, the “Illustrious Mazarin” acting the part of Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that name; a third, the “Illustrious Mazarin” stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de Chavigny, who had expected to have it; a fourth, the “Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin” refusing to give Laporte, the young king’s valet, clean sheets, and saving that “it was quite enough for the king of France to have clean sheets every three months.”
Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder.”
Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.
For Heaven’s sake don’t be obstinate, for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise, and then I become ferocious and headstrong, and there’s my friend, who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself.
But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword-hilts, and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow.
Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.”
“I take it,” said M. de Busigny; “so let us fix the stake.”
This rough appeal, marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French, was uttered with such impenetrable expression that Gondy, clever physiognomist as he was, had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued.
The four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes; and seeing that M. de Tréville did not return, went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen.
“I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night.
Felton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it attentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.
At this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment.
But it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do, however irregular it might be.
One went to support D’Artagnan, the other Porthos.
“Haydée, Haydée, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and be happy.”
It seems to me that it is neither your Majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission.”
Their agony formed part of their merit—if they were not seen alive, they were despised when dead.”
“I understand,” said Morrel; “I am to wait.”
“I don’t know them, but the four other noblemen called the Englishman ‘my lord.’”
“What?”
“How curious!—what is his name?”
The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment.
Chapter LVI.
He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks, pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes, he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide.
“Tell your mistress,” he at length answered, “that I wish to speak to her, and I beg she will wait for me in her own room.”
“Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in the name of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.”
“Lower!
“Wonderful!
“And you complain of that!” said Porthos.
During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on him the most tender endearments.
Fatality.
D’Artagnan, freely applying his spurs, was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most; Mousqueton followed two lengths behind; the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts.
Planchet recognized him first.
“‘“Well,” asked the president, “what do you say to this letter, general?”
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain degree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw himself upon the ground.
“See,” said she, “if everything does not second us!
“I desire that these horses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my carriage.”
“For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took not a step out-of-doors without my following him.
“Do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out together.
‘Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,’ said I; ‘confess how you obtained this animal.’ Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity.
“Indeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?”
Oho!
“You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville, were you not?”
Well, unfurl your wings, and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we are here to ease your fall.”
At four o’clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos.
The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but on casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish accomplished.
In prison he had suffered his beard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath him, and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.
“No one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight.
Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator’s wife, as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire—a little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end.
I scarcely thought you were so curious as that.”
“Oh!
“From the notary, M. Deschamps.”
“Don’t ask my pardon, monsieur,” said Mazarin, “for you fatigued yourself in my service.”
Compared with such things, what is the letter you have just read?—a lover’s deception, which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have married her.
Alas!
The whole world conspires to break our bonds.
“I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature?
To that exclamation of Porthos’s succeeded a groaning, low and profound, which seemed to come from behind a door.
to dinner?” said D’Artagnan.
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security.
“After having lost my own horse, nine against ten—see how near—I formed an idea of staking yours.”
Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantès’ efforts.
yes,” returned the count, “I know who he is, gentlemen; will you return to the salon?
Planchet also was lost in thought, but the subject of their reflections was not the same.
Valentine then took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages.
He came, hoping that I would accept my shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love.
This Gascon is a precious fellow; even his misadventures are of use.”
Andrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been opened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so carefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was perfect.
“I was not thinking of that,” replied Madame Danglars quickly.
Really, if the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed.”
It is you who, sent by him to Constantinople, to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor, brought back a false mandate granting full pardon!
Look at it, Aramis.”
In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads.
“The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o’clock tomorrow morning, my dear count,” replied Danglars.
“I will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother,” said the young man.
“Oh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair, swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his temple.”
I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.
“He must be indeed a strange man.
“Well; but there’s his comrade.”
Madame Broussel, separated by the width of the table from her husband, burst into tears, and the young girls clung to their father’s arms.
Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?”
He was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory.
“He took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me and said, ‘It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not I, since he knows everything and I know nothing.
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm.
Defend yourself.”
Let us save ourselves.”
He took Cucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits.
“You see,” said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, “the turn things have taken.
Haydée Chapter 50.
Oh, my God!
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she only remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter, conceived in the following terms:
“I went, of course, to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries.
“A good journey to ye,” they cried, allowing it to pass.
“You are there, sir?” he said, respectfully.
“Most palpable proofs,” said he, “as you may perceive.”
I cannot account for it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.”
At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear, coming through darkness and space.
“Do you see that ray of sunlight?”
The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France, and also to escape the Frondeurs, who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville, in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes.
“Yes.”
And you really understand none of these signals?”
D’Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.
The host proved to be a worthy man, as bald as a Chinaman.
“Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?”
“Oh, I can’t let you go so!
“How so?” asked Athos.
“No, madame,” said Villefort; “instructions have been given.
“Monsieur,” said he, “as long as I hold him in this manner, he can’t cry, I’ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again.
Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place.”
In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep.
I am fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps, misshapen, frightful monsters have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in which myriads of small fish have slept, seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies.”
“And yet—” said Porthos.
“Obey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?”
As to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his two comrades), his life was very easily known.
“‘Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire.’
“I said, sire, that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish army.”
I am always prepared to go, only, as you know, I never do go, and perhaps shall go this time as little as before.”
“Why, you see, no one knows what may happen.
“By the way,” said Bazin, “where was he carried?”
No, you sounded me, nothing more.
I hope I shall gain Renée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me.
What the devil, Captain, one cannot win all one’s battles!
It is not, either, that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a schoolgirl’s reason, which I consider quite beneath me.
The first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_.
“Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.”
“Family!
“’Tis strange,” said Aramis, almost involuntarily; “I fancied that I recognized Mazarin himself.”
“He should have been—?”
Then, while Madame de Saint-Méran remained on her knees, praying fervently, Villefort sent for a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de Morcerf’s.
“Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”
D’Artagnan swam to it and held it, suspending himself by this rope, his head alone out of water.
The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide.
In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune, D’Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.
But D’Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished.
“Adieu, adieu!” murmured the old man, clasping Edmond’s hand convulsively—“adieu!”
Beauty has always been and always will be all-powerful.
Please pay to my order, from the fund deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my account.
And to that friend I say, ‘During the three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the convulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could also specify the poison.’”
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal.
He placed the young girl again on the chair,—her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and white, as well as her whole face,—and remained motionless, looking at Noirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did.
“The count is here,” said the officer, “and requests to speak with your Eminence instantly.”
Lord de Winter is only her brother-in-law.”
“Ah!
“And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,” said Madame de Villefort; “besides, they are to come to Paris in about a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M. Noirtier.”
In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Condé had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin, leaving, however, a strong garrison in the former city.
The robust Scotchman, accustomed to the snows of his native hills, had stretched himself against a post, and like a fallen statue, insensible to the inclemency of the weather, had allowed the snow to cover him.
Scarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the Place Royale, when they perceived three cavaliers, D’Artagnan, Porthos, and Planchet, the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden, and Planchet, his musket by his side.
He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.
You pretend to pardon me, and you poison me!”
What might be the consequences?
“Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,” placing his hand on his heart, “that I ought to have no secret from you.”
Meantime, between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead.
Athos is not a man to be thwarted; he, like Porthos, has obliged his peasantry to call him ‘my lord,’ and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau.
“Forty,” said Andrea, after a moment’s hesitation, at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise.
“I have no seconds on my part, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “for having only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de Tréville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to be, in some degree, one of his friends.”
She will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she can no longer do so on the Bourse.”
I will go with you.” And he took his sword and cloak.
D’Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword.
“What, without chastising this insolent boy?” asked the lady.
Nevertheless, D’Artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage.
“One of my brothers is about to die and I come to prepare him.”
“Precisely.
Guitant and Comminges, at the head of the guards, marched first; then came the royal carriage, with D’Artagnan on one side, Porthos on the other; then the musketeers, for two and twenty years staunch friends of D’Artagnan.
Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had not lost one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary.
Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.
The Fronde is a comedy, of which the first act only is played.
D’Artagnan alone did not seem convinced.
At these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators—Romans, Italians, strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth, wealth, and genius.
“Am I—am I, then, to sleep on the floor?” asked Gaston d’Orleans, with a forced smile.
When we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.
He cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid servant, but a mere slave—a dog, who, should he fail in his duty towards me, I should not discharge from my service, but kill.”
“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse.
“Then listen,” said he.
“It appears so, sir,” replied Monte Cristo.
A violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the broken door fell in.
“Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere children.”
Had I ten Yaninas in my family, I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times.”
He felt that in returning to camp he should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.
One now and then I don’t say much about; but seven in two days, I repeat, it is too many, it is far too many!”
“I am to fight today.”
The prisoner made no reply.
Prepare yourself, then, to start at once.”
Search among your friends, your oldest friends.”
“The prisoner is there,” replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard, “and I will go myself and tell him he is free.”
“Yes, indeed,” said he; “I think I have seen you and known you formerly.”
The concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger’s name was Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper, he made up his mind not to tell his wife.
Nevertheless, after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull; and the count’s agreeable voice, his gentle and persuasive eloquence, recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from Athos, the most amusing and the best informed of guides.
“Well!” said Porthos and Aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing, “well, he signed the paper she required!”
“I remember now.”
“Let him be sent for instantly.”
Aramis bowed, rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment.
Your very humble and obedient servant, GODEAU, _Purveyor of the Musketeers_
I must have lost it,” said the young man maliciously, pretending to search for it.
“I am perfectly aware of that fact,” answered Monte Cristo calmly.
Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet.
All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of everything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500 francs.
This was, as we have seen, the term which Athos applied to D’Artagnan in his more expansive moods.
He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing orders with his own hand.
He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.
D’Artagnan, Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy.
“Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir?
“Gentlemen,” said Albert, “Germain informs me that breakfast is ready.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
“Then,” continued Milady, “then I collected all my strength; I recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had struck.
“Very kind!”
“Yes.”
The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles.
I really never heard a person speak as you do.”
“Hush!” interrupted Athos.
“Indeed I am,” replied the young magistrate with a smile; “and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated.
“About noon.”
“There again!
“Laporte, place the king in bed.”
Some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging; a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to the times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in his moments of greatest distress Athos had never pledged or offered for sale.
“Yes,” said Morrel, smiling, “it was the 5th of September, the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved; therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by some——”
I repeat it, D’Artagnan, you are the best one among us; I bless and love you, my dear son.”
Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house, France, his ward—a charming youth, for we saw him in the camp—to fly to the aid of a rotten, worm-eaten royalty, which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel.
“You are sure there is nobody there?” said the stranger.
“Do you then regret nothing?”
You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the Variétés; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have nothing to fear.”
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; “that is to say, I _had_ one.”
The woman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.
Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows.
“It appears,” said Cromwell, “that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well.
D’Artagnan nearly jumped for joy; he had despaired of finding Bazin, but now, he thought, since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end.
“Sir,” said Chatillon, “if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen.”
You speak like the Apocalypse, and you are as true as the Gospel.
The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.
Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier d’Humieres his fifty horsemen, less two, missing at roll call.
“Here,” said she, “here is a ring of great value, as I have been assured.
“Ah!
“Her son?” said he.
Without me, you would both have died.
“You are, then, a chemist?”
let us speak frankly,” continued Louvieres, “and act in a straightforward manner.
Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present him.
“Count,” said the duchess, “upon my word, you frighten me.”
30075m
Franz and the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them.
Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch.
I do not understand Italian.”
There was such irony in the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger, but at a word from Flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying:
According to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door.
Then I should become simply No.
The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture.
“Now you are rich,” said Monte Cristo.
“And what did the letter contain?”
“Restore my brother to peace and happiness,” whispered Julie to Monte Cristo.
As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap.
Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?”
“Don’t be afraid,” said D’Artagnan.
“All right,” said Athos.
Gaetano was not mistaken.
And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a remnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.
Now, this point was settled; Mme.
“Absolutely nothing.
“Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen?” said Anne of Austria, drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening.
“To Paris first; I have affairs to settle.”
Oh, save me!”
The position in which he had left him was critical.
It was only a precaution.
“Bravo!
What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean with a fine wench of seventeen?”
“Then it will be but charitable to inform him.
Your voice is that of a young man.”
It was D’Artagnan, who was waiting for him.
Athos mounted more slowly, after speaking in a low voice to the lackey, who, instead of following them immediately, returned to their rooms.
“And we are going to be recompensed for our diligence?” continued the mercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice—so trifling, indeed, that D’Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the worthy man.
“As thirsty as a Scotchman!” was Grimaud’s laconic reply.
“In the name of heaven, explain yourself!”
How D’Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Athos, “what is the penalty you demand against this woman?”
I have therefore believed, monseigneur, knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time, that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of England.
This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey.
“Have you something to tell me?” asked he.
Milady listened.
Besides, what does the Gospel say?
“Yes, Milady,” replied Athos; “the Comte de la Fère in person, who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit.
“For me, I well know, my sweet girl,” said D’Artagnan.
Rob your master, eat his sweetmeats, and drink his wine; but, by Jove!
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been, in some sort, forced to give his hand to Albert.
“And if I do not give him up, what think you will be the result?” exclaimed the queen.
Still further, Monsieur de Tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble.
This garden has never been a cemetery.”
“On the contrary, I do.”
The duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud, but there was no glance in Grimaud’s eyes.
“Yes.”
“Listen,” cried he; “pity me—help me!
“It is half-past eleven o’clock; Haydée will soon be here.
But Dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature, that he believed everybody’s professions of friendship.
Porthos turned around like a lion, plunged on the dismounted cavalier, who tried to draw his sword; but before it was out of the scabbard, Porthos, with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher’s knife.
“You hear, madame?”
“Were fruitless; chance did everything.”
“Do you know what we are eating here?” said Athos, at the end of ten minutes.
“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding her write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres.
But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor.
Oh, it is impossible!—utterly impossible!”
“I wish it.”
The countess made no reply.
“My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present.”
In your place, in truth, sire, I should yield to such powerful instance; and on my part, it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs.”
He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget.
For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”
Have you traded it for your diamond?”
“Then mine is the boat you want, sir.
“First, my lord?” inquired Grimaud.
“Where will it take me?”
The count withdrew his foot.
“Rather say, to take him back with you into the world.
my young vicomte,” replied Scarron, “I suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive.”
“You will then be at my service?” asked Mazarin.
“Excellent,” murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away.
“Be careful; advice is worse than a service.”
“My Lord,—I have already one man to offer to your eminence, and he is well worth twenty men.
Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to fear.”
If you heard the cry of ‘Mad dog!’ you would take your gun—you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog.
“That of dying together.”
“Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone.”
“Do you say so now, Mercédès?—then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you?
His father and mother were Catholics, I believe?”
The Trial.
“Never mind that,” returned the sailor, “I know their vessel.”
“Is he armed?”
“The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to Rothschild’s or Lafitte’s, and they will take it off your hands at once.”
“That is not his biggest scoop,” said Morcerf; “did he not make a million in Spaniards this last year?”
Soon—strange fact—Aramis undid two buttons of his doublet, seeing which, Porthos unfastened his entirely.
Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely!
“Mother, I must go,” said Albert in a firm, calm voice; “you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I have signed.”
50047m
“Yes, my lord, on one condition.”
Stay, since we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will take coffee in the garden.
“My dear Monsieur de Rochefort,” Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery, “you think yourself still a young man; your spirit is that of the phoenix, but your strength fails you.
“So young,” said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count’s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name?”
D’Artagnan approached him, and seeing him stare so fixedly, said:
Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
“I did think of it, but this letter has neither date nor postmark.”
All I have is at his service.”
Once on board we drop down the Thames and in two hours are on the open sea.
“Indeed, count,” said Morcerf, “I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose.
Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.”
That will be four killed.
At whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself, remember that I shall be ready to give you absolution.”
About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the carriage.
This was evidently an ambuscade.
“I don’t maintain the contrary,” said D’Artagnan.
Putting the letter in her bosom, she took her son’s arm, and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs.
Of this treaty, at least, I have been warned.
Besides which, the Musketeer, after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him, broached the matter first.
Andrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale.
My God!
The latter, faithful to the principle of Horace, _nil admirari_, had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught.
Cloud.
“I say that Valentine is dead!” replied d’Avrigny, in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness.
And yet, in all this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham.
As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo.
“And now we understand each other.”
“No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast.
They are the spoils of victory.”
impious task!” cried Milady, with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge.
Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so sweet a comforter.
“I will watch over them as I have over you.”
I have no enmity against M. Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him.”
“See, they are here.” And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate, which opened before them.
But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside.
Grimaud and I got behind a tree, and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself, threw himself on his face in the road.
In an instant they found themselves in a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat grounded on the fine sand.
And what do you know about them, Monsieur?
If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every point.”
The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and found the following note concerning him:
“Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution, we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us.
“The devil!” said Athos, musingly.
In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms.
They had not long to wait.
As quick as thought, he tore open the letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do, or rather, what he was doing.
This postscript decreased greatly the young girl’s happiness.
And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.
In a few minutes a night watch passed.
“Sir,” replied Mordaunt, “I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging.”
“What, you do not know!
The room was neatly, comfortably furnished.
Danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant, “Put in your head!” He was making rapid progress in Italian.
“At least, you must admire Moriani’s style and execution.”
where is thy master?”
“And I,” said Tréville, coldly, “I have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen.”
You were in the south of France, I think?”
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family.
D’Artagnan, who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three paces from it.
“And who is to pursue him?” cried Mazarin.
The Departure for Belgium
“It is a quarter of an hour’s journey from here to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour’s journey from the city to hither.
“Bravo, Athos!
For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.”
In fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot.
The Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers.
“And you responded to his bidding, you imprudent man?”
She was thinking of the despair of Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de Saint-Méran, instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy.
“Yes, sir,” answered the host, even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it; “I am Gaspard Caderousse, at your service.”
“He has; he is an abbé.”
“Do you know, my dear Villefort,” cried the Comte de Salvieux, “that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when questioned by his majesty’s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de Condé; and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles.
“Bravo!”
The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.
He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel, but he was well prepared for what might happen.
I must obey you, though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water.”
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.
Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.
And you say that Monsieur d’Artagnan was one of those four men?”
I wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago.
“Insults!”
“I will find him, as I told you.
Come—let us see them.’
Caderousse, awed by the superior power of the abbé, sat down and wrote:
“What do you want of me?” he asked.
“The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont Neuf, opposite the Samaritaine.”
We must ask the Comte de la Fere the question.
“_Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alla sette il Conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere_.
“And now,” said Athos, “it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen, but we must map up our campaign.
Once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure; but until that time, I warn you that in my capacity of general of the army I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across.” De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other, smiling.
Can it, gentlemen?” added the young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to his friends.
Nevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured her.
“That is what it is to be rich.”
I hoped in silence.
The Story
He said “yes” and he put his hand on his sword.
“You had your portfolio with you, then?
“Of what companion are you speaking, dear Constance?”
Danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak Italian, he understood it very well.
Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight.
You are irritated and vexed—tell me how this Fernand is related to you?”
“You are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!” said Tréville, “not to accept the proposal I am about to make to you.”
‘Faith, I do not remember the name of the hotel.”
“Ah, if you speak in that way,” said Athos, “you will break my heart, and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.
“Nothing, nothing.
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” she murmured.
“And who had a lackey named Grimaud?” persisted Planchet, who had prudently considered that he couldn’t have too much information.
“I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that.” And the young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child.
“Then the postscript——”
“I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.”
The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for Kitty that of a lackey; he sent them two excellent horses, and the fugitives went out hastily from Tours, shaping their course toward Spain, trembling at the least noise, following unfrequented roads, and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn.”
“I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need,—your plain clothes and your uniform.
And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the astonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.
“It appears so,” said Athos, “since here they are.
You are a hundred times too good.”
Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent.
Be satisfied,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “Porthos will pay you with the money of the Duchess Coquenard.”
“How are you, sir?” asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.
The four friends exchanged glances.
Between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss.
Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man’s road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident, and alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at which they had stopped on their first journey.
“And is her name a secret?”
“The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the register of your child’s birth.”
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:
Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, “Well, you understand there is no need to kill him.”
The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M. Chapelain.
Three arcades were before them, and the middle one was used as a door.
The lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant, who, according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in advance.
“My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?” said Athos.
And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate—to be close to you without really seeing you—have I ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength?
“I am called the Count de Guiche,” continued the young man; “my father is the Marechal de Grammont; and now that you know who I am, do me the honor to inform me who you are.”
“Well, I will go to England a second time; I will go and find Buckingham.”
He found the prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with weeping.
“Yes, I!”
It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.”
“Swear it upon the cross.”
I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his.
Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”
I don’t comprehend.”
It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes.
After the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to the charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift, reappeared with it on her finger.
Albert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted to the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea.
The master of _La Jeune Amélie_, who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted.
And bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took the road to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried the basket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.
“Yes, my prince.
“What relics are those by which you swear?” asked Mazarin, smiling.
He leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were on board.
“Oh, no, my lord!” said the incredulous soldier.
If you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say, ‘No, my daughter is not guilty;—there is no crime in my house.
Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her.
“Yes, but when once they are hamstrung, our necks will be strung next.”
“It is his voice!” said Julie.
The rest of the dinner was to come.
“As I entered Nîmes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered, and burned.
Valentine seized the count’s hand, and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips.
Excuse curiosity, but I wish to be enlightened on the subject.”
“I will facilitate it by repeating the question, ‘Will you, or will you not, retract?’”
To be imprisoned.
“What happened then?” she asked.
Madame de Saint-Méran Chapter 73.
“In the Bastile.”
He had sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M. d’Artagnan the elder.
“Well, here, for example,” said Richelieu: “when, in 1610, for a cause similar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV., of glorious memory, was about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in order to attack Austria on both sides.
“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report.
“That must have cut short the projects of escape.”
After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of God.”
Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in France.
if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits, when we were at Crevecoeur; I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron.
The lackey bowed to the ground and departed.
The staircase creaked, he descended into the room below, approached the fire and lit a candle.
“I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service.
“MARIE MICHON”
Whence came the blow?
“Then the Countess G—— has returned to Paris, has she?” inquired the baroness.
And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective arguments were all on Albert’s side.
“You were in a cloister,” said the executioner, “and you left it to ruin my brother.”
“Farther still, perhaps.”
Come, Haydée, come!” and throwing his arm around the young girl’s waist, he pressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.
I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange; I met Monsieur Dujart in England; I know Monsieur de Tréville.”
I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king’s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.”
“On his right and left, sir.
Bertuccio made amends, however, by loading the antechambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces with flowers.
“Undoubtedly,” said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, “a marriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit on a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to put an end to, will instantly gain ground.
Mazarin, perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say, made a sign that D’Artagnan and Porthos should give place.
“Hallo!” continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the table, “hallo, Edmond!
“You can speak before me,” said Franz; “I am a friend of the count’s.”
The unhappy young man had not thought of this.
At this instant, in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious, and first were seen, rising above the waves, a wisp of hair, then a pale face with open eyes, yet, nevertheless, the eyes of death; then a body, which, after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea, turned gently on its back, according to the caprice of the waves, and floated.
Now, I tell you, you must pass with me through this army across to Scotland, and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names, which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with—you are either cowards or traitors!”
No, it is not finished; I feel it by what remains in my heart.
“Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.”
Mme.
That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had employed it for another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy.
“Alas,” replied the weeping girl, “I am obliged to own that my stepmother’s aversion to me arises from a very natural source—her overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.”
“Yes; No.
Astonishment was at its height.
“How delighted I am to have found you!
“Well, let it be three weeks then,” said Morcerf; “but remember, at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in——”
Then she broke the silence to cry out, “You are cowards, miserable assassins—ten men combined to murder one woman.
“In what year—you ask me in what year?”
“M.
He will not desert, Monsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.”
Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin?
“Four hundred?” said Porthos.
Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.
The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed himself before the horse, within two paces of D’Artagnan.
“Yes, if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief.”
“One of the last, as you see; if you hear anything of Monsieur Voiture, be so kind as to send me word to-morrow.”
“You here, Rochefort?” he said, in a low voice.
One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of Rome.
He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing.
And without listening to Villefort he arose, and followed Valentine, who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to.
In those times panics were common, and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind.
Porthos said nothing, but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing.
“I believed him still at Brussels.”
“Sooner,” said Aramis.
“What?”
You do not know my mother; she it is whom you see here.
Then he said aloud:
Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law.
“Andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.
Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in not being recognized.
I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits.
Near the camp you might be recognized; and your presence, you must be aware, would compromise the cardinal.”
I once bore another, which you knew, but you have certainly forgotten it.”

“My lord, I think we are in bad company.”
“Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.”
Mordaunt hesitated; but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth.
She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars’ hand, pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.
“Your holiness,” said the curate, “here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to you.”
“Ah, true, a diplomatist!” observed Debray.
“Without speaking to anyone but yourself?”
“My reason?” replied the young girl.
“Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one?” muttered D’Artagnan.
30197m
I live, as it were, between two graves.
I don’t know him.
“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per cent.”
“I do not deny it,” returned the count; “but why are you thus agitated.
He was wrapped in a large rough cape, which concealed his form and partly his face.
D’Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris.
I will give them.
“Do you know me, madame?” said he.
Why, you sell yourself, body and soul, to the demon, the devil, for money!”
The servant went out.
“Yes; for I have the proofs.”
“Then what did you mean——”
The misfortune is great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow hawks, and tiercels.”
“That’s it,” said the cardinal, “that’s it.
“Yes,” said the king, “but I do not wish to be touched by any of those men.”
I am stricken by fate.
Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmond’s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish.
The vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the wharf.
My God!”
“I will take it in the Turkish style,” replied Franz.
“Yes,” said the paralytic with the same solemnity.
“Well, what good wind blows you hither at this hour?” said he; “have you come to sup with me?
In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate.
“The duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,” replied Richelieu, with great bitterness.
Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas, yet moist with the cold dews of death, had touched his face.
And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat.
“Will you tell me that your three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your youngster from Béarn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor Bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead?
Call for me at eight o’clock or shall I wait supper for you at seven?”
Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing; that is all I want.”
or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight?
After reading the letter, Villefort covered his face with his hands.
“By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand correspondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand correspondent to prepare in his turn.”
“Ah, ah!” said the doctor, “I did not know that I had a rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.”
“His father?”
“Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.”
Felton remained in the corridor.
“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”
“Why, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality, the Duchesse de—but, your pardon; my master has commanded me to be discreet.
“Yes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.”
“What Aramis says is very sensible,” replied Athos; “we must speculate upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues.
“Explain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive things.”
have you your sword, Athos?” cried D’Artagnan.
“That is to say, he was there,” replied Planchet.
But since you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo my pretended benefactor—then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;” and Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.
“Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold.
The two friends walked out on the fortress.
You can understand, honored and dear guardian, how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you.
“Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man than I am?” he said to himself.
Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and Pampinara had disappeared.
Grimaud remained with his hand extended; then, striking his forehead, he exclaimed:
“No,” replied Monte Cristo; “God grant I may not have done too much already.”
The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy and Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic—a bon mot which had great success.
“Bah,” said Athos, “we were always dry.”
“The count will find there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.”
These studs cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace.”
How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten.
“Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage?”
“Here, your excellency,” said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool and the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell.
When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès.
“That is good to see,” said Aramis.
“Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours?” demanded the host.
“He is a Quaker then?”
“The deuce!” cried D’Artagnan.
Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway, while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready.
Your hand, Dantès!
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door free, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as possible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he met Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained with blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat, crying, “I knew it!
I demand the suppression of the thesis.”
While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open, turned, and saw his father.

“They think of me in their pleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles.
“But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing?”
Are you a man of imagination—a poet?
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.
The Morrel Family Chapter 51.
Adieu!
“Oh, heavens!
Since when, I wonder, in the Musketeers, did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it?”
“A great pity,” said Monte Cristo.
“You will know presently—pass it.”
I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascus—you remember it, Aramis for you always called it Balizarde.
An hour after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.
Just as, ordinarily, faces are colored by blood, his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid.
“Hem!” said D’Artagnan, “there is some truth in what you say.”
Bertuccio left.
“Apropos,” continued he, “Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you; you dislike him, I think?”
They are.
“Well?” he said to the lieutenant.
“Well, agreed for a pretty mule,” said Porthos; “you are right, I have seen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.
“Silence, Porthos!” said Aramis.
Oh, my God, thou knowest whether I am guilty!
“My sword is shorter than yours, it’s true, but, bah!
“But it is D’Artagnan that will come.”
“I am certain of it.”
The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not a gentleman, I may be allowed to lie.”
“What?
Raoul was about to reply when D’Artagnan bent down to his ear.
But even while they watched his daring progress, Edmond’s foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear.
I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up, my knife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his arms to find his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair, I struck him in the middle of his breast.
“Albert,” she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion, “I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances.
“What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder.
The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to their swords.
“But, sir,” said Planchet, with a look of shrewdness, “I know where Bazin is.”
Besides, I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk.”
“Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment.
After living forty years with the marquis——”
“Have you a good horse, Monsieur de Bragelonne?”
“It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a compensation.
Rochefort, rendered suspicious and cautious by these words, entered the apartment, where he found Mazarin sitting at the table, dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church, his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day, excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet.
At the moment he passed through the gateway into the street, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although it was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it eagerly over his eyes.
“‘What to do with him?’ answered the prince.
“Here it is,” said Aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which, however, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:
As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment, saying:
“Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand; he desired they should be returned to the queen.”
“Money never comes amiss at any time, my lord; if one has it not, one must do without it; with it, matters go on much better and more rapidly.”
No sooner said than done.
“Since my imprisonment,” said Faria, “I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record.
Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal.
“His excellency waits for you,” said a voice, which he recognized as that of the sentinel.
“Cardinal Mazarin?” said he.
“Ah, that is something serious.”
Adieu, mademoiselle.
“What is it?” asked he.
“She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir, since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent.”
“Besides,” continued the young man, “if there did appear some defect in education, or offence against the established forms of etiquette, I suppose it would be excused, in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth, and followed me through my youth.”
“To be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.”
And pray what was this quarrel about?”
“I should, my dear D’Artagnan, have been so, but nature said ‘No.’ When I am in the pulpit, if by chance a pretty woman looks at me, I look at her again: if she smiles, I smile too.
Did you ever see her furious?”
“And who is the Countess G——?” inquired Château-Renaud.
The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon’s recital, of the captain’s brave conduct during the storm, and tried to console him.
“He is as well as you and I.”
“Ah!
Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine, and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.
The porter got up as Eugénie expected, and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.
“As ugly?”
Oh, no, Edmond, it is myself that I blame, myself that I hate!
as to that, no,” replied Athos, laughing.
“‘Follow me, then,’ said the sentinel; ‘or, as you know your way, go first.’
Besides, there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought—in what way was the escape to be effected?
He knew that Athos not only never drank, but more, that he had a kind of repugnance to wine.
“Hey!
“Are we then going to travel, my lord?” asked Mousqueton, rather uneasy.
Leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied.”
“Take them,” said Cromwell.
This man has often made me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I thought I should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit.”
“But one recovers, sir, as you perceive,” replied Raoul, “and we have but had a little bath.”
Valentine also knew the truth, but she did not answer.
The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion.
D’Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears.
“How do you know it is the doctor?” asked Valentine, astonished.
Adieu, madame.
I have already answered that question in the affirmative; but that command must come from the queen herself.”
He assumed his costume, and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face.
I have my plan; let me carry it out and we shall laugh.”
“My dear M. Lucien,” said Madame Danglars through the door, “you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to you.”
They stopped at the sign of the Fox, in the Rue du Vieux Colombier, a tavern known for many years by Athos, and asked for two bedrooms.
With the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month.
Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy.
“Well, Grimaud, my friend, have you seen anything?” asked the Gascon.
I am neither an angel nor a demon; I am a daughter of earth, I am a sister of thy faith, that is all.”
“What is it?”
It was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king entered.
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist and icy cold.
I ask you what year is it?”
“Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself, one insists on respect suitable to one’s rank.”
“It is a color very well known in botany, but till the present time very rare among horses.”
“My dear Albert,” said Debray, rising, “it is half-past two.
My apartment will be close to his.
“At least wait until the story has a conclusion.”
Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.
“Did you doubt it?” said the young captain.
Come, gentlemen, come!”
“And writes me thence.”
“To no one.”
“Begone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight!
Nothing could be better done; a sun-dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision.
Well, my friend, nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow.”
“I have given the signal.”
Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties.
“Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us—the child was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!”
During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything.
“Yes, all.”
The musketeer, who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service, obeyed without a word, although he thought the order strange.
I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is the first time I have ever been at Paris.
Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the conversation; but the citizen declared to D’Artagnan that, what he had to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone with him.
“A problem, my dear count, for everyone—for my mother as well as others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not fear.
We have cruelly wounded, as you know, that personal pride by which D’Artagnan is blindly governed.
Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him.
On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things.
Athos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly the hatred, of Buckingham.
I am half an hour in advance of them, an hour, perhaps.
“Brave Athos!” murmured D’Artagnan, “and to think that we are compelled to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence.
“Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,” said the count; “gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.”
“We believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,” said Athos.
“The devil take me, if I remember,” returned Château-Renaud.
“Apropos, what are the names of your friends?”
The two gentlemen then went into the church.
“Hush, hush!” replied Franz; “we shall ascertain who and what he is—he comes!”
I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse’s tail, and thus they took me to Nîmes.
“Well, now, what do you say to a cart?
Years have elapsed, many events have happened, alas!
“Ah, Porthos!” cried one of his companions, “don’t try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity.
Madame, you are deceived,” said Porthos; “she is simply a duchess.”
“He desired me to tell your Grace,” replied Felton, “that he very much regretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle.”
Gondy withdrew, distributing benedictions on his way, and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet.
Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”
D’Artagnan already wore his uniform—for being nearly of the same size as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his friend a complete outfit.
He bowed politely to the baroness, familiarly to Danglars, and affectionately to Monte Cristo.
behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you.
Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers, D’Artagnan felt completely solitary.
“You have talked of me?”
“I will follow you, then, sir.”
This scrutiny was so much the more easy, the coachman being sound asleep.
“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and I hope he fully understood it.”
Motionless, with her burning and fixed glances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration, accompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls, roars, and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle!
Now, in the opinion of D’Artagnan, it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme.
“Ah,” said Andrea, “when may we hope for that pleasure?”
“Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.”
“Oh!
A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.
The porter was drawing the cord at the moment Milady cried from her window, “Don’t open!”
The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.
It was then that the door of Edward’s room opened, and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de Villefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared.
...know of the existence of this treasure, which
Two lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm.
“How can I tell?” said D’Artagnan.
Fernand dashed his on the ground.
“My advice is this,” said Monsieur d’Arminges, “and if needs be, my will, that we beat a retreat.
This verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul, completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.
The window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it was now still more pale than before.
“Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.”
My friend here, Monsieur du Vallon, shares my gratitude, for he was particularly hungry.”
“Listen,” said he to him.
“Try, my dear Laporte, to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le Cardinal, to whom both he and I are under such important obligations.”
“Bah!”
“Is there a window in the dressing-room?”
I staked on him.”
“Yes.”
“Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,” replied Caderousse.
“But, my Lord—”
“You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well that you already yield, dear Maximilian.
She was in tears, and, strange as it was, in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears, he looked also at Madame de Villefort, and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips, like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky.
“To give them the order to charge, and run down these miserable rebels.”
“Why, what good would it do?” asked Caderousse.
They used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house.
Then he paused.
“Well, then, take him,” said the cardinal; “when four men are so much attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the same company.”
“But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?”
“I came to thank God for my happy deliverance,” said Rochefort.
“Well, what do you wish to know?”
Milady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme.
“Indeed!” said Milady, in an anxious tone; “explain yourself, for I really cannot tell what you mean.”
Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when, from the top of that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine, pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand.
Besides even you didn’t recognize me; they will be much less likely to.”
Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose.
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet-de-chambre, who opened the door of the vestibule, then another which seemed to be that of a waiting-room, and showing them two stools:
“Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a courtyard and a garden,—you must know it.”
“Ah, my friend,” said he, “it is all the better if you are in difficulties.”
“You will not touch the garden either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition.”
At this very moment Mazarin entered.
You never knew her.”
“Do you think that likely?”
“I didn’t understand it all,” he said, “but I understand now; how droll it is!”
Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work.
The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince, who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o’clock in the morning.

“In two or three hours,” thought Dantès, “the turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm.
He is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword thrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man,” and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes.
I may be besieged in my turn, and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master.”
Groslow whistled and a sailor appeared.
“Yes; but I confess I always thought you jested.”
He believed, having triumphed over me in my sleep, that all was completed.
Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny.
Oh, spare me!”
According to his conviction, she was some creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account.
“Yes, yes,” said Felton; “I understand how he would act.
_A propos_, add one thing—”
The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramee’s unspoken soliloquy, reading it from point to point upon his face.
“I, madame,” replied he, “follow Monsieur de la Fere wherever he leads, even were it on to death, without demanding wherefore; but when it concerns your majesty’s service, then,” added he, looking at the queen with all the grace of former days, “I precede the count.”
“And now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you that name,” said Lord de Winter, “on this very evening, if agreeable to you, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you.”
“Pass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.”
“It is worth something, you see, to have been brought up somewhere.”
25 in the Rue de Vaugirard; 75 in the Rue de la Harpe.”
“You believe in sorcerers, then, you fool?”
“See what an exordium!” cried the Jesuit.
Felton, give me that knife!”
“Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but it is not the less true that you——Ah, but what do I hear?” and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar.
and what a strange air for a victor!”
The queen will never banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me; if I fly, she will fly; and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen.
“Madame,” replied D’Artagnan, “I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do so.
“Yes.”
“Do,” said Aramis.
“Well, we shall see.”
“I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues.”
“The prime minister,” she said, “is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time, without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court.”
He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse.
“Ah,” said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung _Partant pour la Syrie_,—“we will not go alone to the garden.”
“I came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done with this impostor?”
I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris?”
“No, God forbid,” said the cardinal; “only, at what hour was he with you?”
“Do you observe,” said the Countess G—— to Albert, who had returned to her side, “that man does nothing like other people; he listens most devoutly to the third act of _Robert le Diable_, and when the fourth begins, takes his departure.”
The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within four steps of D’Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle; but the precaution was too late, D’Artagnan had already recognized Mme.
I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London, and I say to you, ‘Live, sire,’—it is the will of Heaven.”
[13] Ali Pasha, “The Lion,” was born at Tepelini, an Albanian village at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741.
no,” said Albert; “nor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.”
“Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks’ time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!”
Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten.
“Thank you, sir,” said Albert, smiling.
Sit down, Morrel, and wait.”
“You see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is destroyed; you and I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny all knowledge of it—deny it boldly, and you are saved.”
But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which I wish to speak.”
“You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your body.
“Yes; see, I send a ball into the moat; a man is there who picks it up; the ball contains a letter.
“A play?”
I should have thought that his duchess—”
Oh!
Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed.
“Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones,” replied the Englishman.
If you can, my dear D’Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle—”
Has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep?
At all events, should you be wounded, write to me that very instant, or get some one at once to write to me.
The three horsemen made no reply, stopped not, and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed.
Madame uttered fresh sighs.
D’Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen’s diamond, which he wore, and quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.
Why should that man give me a false diamond?”
Amongst the Catalans, Mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still she never really wanted any.
“Faubourg Saint-Germain,” said Château-Renaud.
Expenses on the road, about fifty francs........ ....... 50.
Good heavens!
“Hem!” muttered Porthos, with a kind of pretense of answering.
“What business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur d’Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during the day?”
“The devil!” cried Aramis, “you have a magnificent horse there, Porthos.”
During the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the Bastile—where he remained for twelve long years—when his companions, in their dreams of liberty, said to each other: “As for me, I shall go out of the prison at such a time,” and another, at such and such a time, the duke used to answer, “As for me, gentlemen, I shall leave only when Monsieur du Tremblay leaves;” meaning that at the death of the cardinal Du Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De Bassompierre regain his at court.
I shall go and die by his side.”
“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did you make your ink?”
Another motive had influenced Albert’s selection of his seat,—who knew but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?
“I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things—the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.”
“It is astonishing,” said he.
“But I have sworn to kill that man!” said D’Artagnan.
The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey.
To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb.
“My brother,” continued she, “was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived?”
Chapter XVII.
“We sent you wine?”
“Oh!” cried Anne, “to humble myself thus!
Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine.
He will amass wealth, he will injure the king’s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others.
“I believe, mother, it is merely a title.
I did not think two sapphires of such a fine water existed.
Each retired to his own apartment.
“I listen.”
“No, I didn’t know that.
Motionless against the dark tapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image of terror.
The boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing the guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the right-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.
“Yes.”
“Well, then, be more affectionate, my dear Villefort,” said the baroness.
Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast.
“Maximilian,” said the count, “you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at Marseilles.
D’Artagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his voice.
“Do you, perchance, think I set any great store by life?”
“My plan!”
Ah!
Four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.
Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without speaking a word, without making a gesture.
Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over.
That would spoil my plans.”
“And why, pray, Master La Ramee?” asked the duke.
“Oh, that is charming,” said Albert, “how I should like to hear my countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence, Mademoiselle Christian Charity!
A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions.
First she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes mere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep, heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till daylight.
“My fifty recruits from the Chevalier d’Humieres, who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks.”
“And was he not so?” asked the abbé.
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.”
and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dantès?”
“I was going to say, there’s no longer a queen.
Demand anything you want, and I will hasten to have you furnished with it.”
“What?”
Eventually she was obliged to leave France.
Bah!
The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days.
Monsieur d’Arminges, who was at the door, perceived his hesitation.
“Yes.”
“He!
“A moment’s delay,” said Athos; “our servants?”
“What has he to do at Notre Dame?”
There are no tears in my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer—you, Maximilian, whom I love as my own son.
I am nearly thirty-seven.”
The Abbé Scarron.
“Oh, Athos!” said Aramis, “truly you are a great man.”
“But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,” said the young man; “I assure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy.
All the other guests followed.
D’Artagnan began to be touched.
Then D’Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.
Am I not right, M. de Château-Renaud?”
The blade was red, for the blood had become rust; after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning, he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder.
Try, Porthos, to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows.
“He has become an abbé, that is all.”
The catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would certainly afford our readers but little amusement.
The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm manner, at the same time casting his eyes down, either to give himself time to compose his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the while giving an under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity.
“_Morbleu_,” said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, “reduced to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet!
“I answer for his consent.”
If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg™ work.
“Yes, my lord, the pure parliament.”
“Oh!” cried the executioner, “all!
The ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one another’s arms.
He desired him also, should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon, to fetch him, taking on himself the payment of the messenger.
“What do you want?” asked he, with a more sorrowful than angry tone.
“Ah, a window!” exclaimed Signor Pastrini,—“utterly impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.”
Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly.
He held a vial of salts in his hand.
I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Corsicans.
“Every criminal says the same thing.”
But _mio caro_ did not reply.
The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell, who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually.
“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be captain of the _Pharaon_—eh, Danglars?”
“Oh.” cried Madame de Villefort, “it is really frightful.”
“I seem to miss something here.
I will go to the queen.”
“You will observe, gentlemen,” said Athos, “that Porthos has made the best bargain of any of us.”
After passing through the Porte Saint Denis, Athos looked at Raoul’s way of riding and observed:
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “I know you to be cowardly, avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!”
Is there any crime in this request?”
“S’blood!” cried he to D’Artagnan, “do not kill him, young man, I beg of you.
“The fact is,” hazarded D’Artagnan, timidly, “I did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis.
Busoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate’s face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was ignorant.
He now saw where the breastplate was weak, and prepared the blow.
But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this?”
Then Valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room, which marked the seconds.
“The house of Thomson & French; at least, so my cashier tells me.”
“But still, we can make sure that they are so.”
“Night arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark.
“Your majesty will do us justice.
“Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and I must make up for it.”
“We are lost,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos.
Franz, however, did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent.
The ante-rooms were still full of soldiers, the passages still lined by guards.
“Oh!
Did you know him?
“As true as I am a Christian,” stammered Caderousse, “you will make me die of fright!”
“‘_Nothing new; You have an hour;_’ or ‘_Tomorrow_.’”
The man in the mantle advanced towards me, but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand.
“You are a woman of precaution, I see, my dear Madame Coquenard,” said Porthos, squeezing the hand of the procurator’s wife tenderly.
I tendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field, you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons.
“Yes, yes, my dear count, I feel that you are right.”
“What will you do with the letter, then?” asked Porthos.
“After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M. Franz d’Épinay.
“I have seen him once,” replied Grimaud, a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection.
These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took no notice of them.
D’Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Milady’s, but she evaded him.
“He is worse than that,—he is a devil!” returned the turnkey.
“Come, Athos!” said D’Artagnan, giving his hand to the count; “you are going to see something curious,” added the Gascon.
The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she yet was tolerably obedient.
Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and especially incredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look upon “the noble stranger,” as Monte Cristo was already called, as an adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the _Thousand and One Nights_.
What I propose to do is fair in war; the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means.
“By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.”
At the same time he felt the duke’s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws; but instead either of calling out or defending himself, he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone:
“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him.
They have killed them, I think, and taken flight, carrying off their booty.
“And what hast thou to say, boy, to Monsieur Broussel?”
Toxicology Chapter 53.
“Well, take them; that makes seventy.”
U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Now, what would you say to an ensign’s commission in my Guards, and a company after the campaign?”
“Who will tell her?”
Look here!
“Not so bad yet,” replied Athos; “for by this time she must have quit the shores of France.”
_Non inutile desiderium oblatione_.”
Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed.
“You know, sir, that before receiving the order one must submit proofs.”
God, who might have directed the assassin’s dagger so as to end your career in a moment, has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance.
VOLUME TWO Chapter 28.
“Sir,” said Aramis, “you speak to the point.
But wait.
“Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel,” said Beauchamp.
“At the Hotel de Ville, my dear fellow.”
I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father——”
The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life of individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a Flamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.”
“I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to applaud him.
“Undoubtedly,” said Aramis, “and even at the head of his twenty men, if I could have drawn without being recognized.”
“Third-rate,” said Danglars, rather humble, “what do you mean by that?”
“I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little desert.
“Then that’s my thief,” replied D’Artagnan.
The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head.
I must go to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.”
“But not until two o’clock,” said D’Artagnan, with the same calmness.
“When such resolutions are made, Albert, they should be promptly executed.
Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive their young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his Eminence, stopped outside the door.
“No,” returned she, “but I feel some emotion on seeing, for the first time, the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation.
These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.”
“So you will say nothing?” asked the abbé.
But they are calling me.
So throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and purse-proud air:
“Ah, noble fellow!” cried he.
Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it.
“Monsieur de Comminges,” said Athos, “I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders; but outside your orders there is a service you can render me.”
The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions.
“Zounds!” cried D’Artagnan, “don’t call him Porthos, nor even Vallon; call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds; thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise.”
It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.
“And then?”
“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten experienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many years to perforate it.
“It is true, sir,” said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness; “a secondary cause, but not the principal.”
What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy?
Oh, be assured, if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at Tyburn.
“Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?”
“Most assuredly,” replied he.
The Assizes Chapter 110.
I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he makes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone.”
D’Artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room, and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family.
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.
Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?” said the cashier.
You are going to kill the son, as you killed the mother!
“A moment, gentlemen, a moment; give Grimaud time to clear away the breakfast.”
“And you disinherit your granddaughter,” continued the notary, “because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?”
“How so?”
“Oh, sir!” cried Raoul.
“From Friquet?
But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications.
But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son.
“So much the better,” muttered Athos.
Baptiste, give me yesterday’s paper,” cried Beauchamp.
Morrel smiled, and shook his head.
“Madame,” said Mazarin, with a smile, “you may rest easy; your wishes shall be fulfilled.”
“What is this gentleman’s name?” asked the commissary.
Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a viscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris.
“I beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me.”
“_Ma foi_, captain,” replied the sentry, “I do not know; for the last hour I have not heard him stir.”
“But,” suggested D’Artagnan, “have we not our friend Mousqueton, who managed for us so well at Chantilly, Porthos?”
Whew!
“No friends left, my lord; no other friends left in the wide world but yourself!
Mazarin groaned.
The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis, planted near a great chair on castors, very large, covered with a canopy of tapestry, under which there moved, enveloped in a quilt of brocade, a little face, youngish, very merry, somewhat pallid, whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively, intellectual, and amiable.
“You are a fool, M. Baptistin.
“I cannot tell you that,” replied the inspector; “I can only promise to examine into your case.”
“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the young man.
The young man bent low, with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled, and retired in order to saddle his horse.
He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep, which was very annoying to him, when D’Artagnan, instead of explaining, closed his mouth with his hand.
“But, my dear fellow, those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off, especially with so good an excuse to give on your return——”
As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, “My carriage.”
“Well?”
So he cherishes no resentment?”
“Mademoiselle,” replied Morrel with a bitter smile, “I am selfish—you have already said so—and as a selfish man I think not of what others would do in my situation, but of what I intend doing myself.
It is said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I felt the electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.”
Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits.
“Four days,” replied his friend, “are necessary to reach Blois; one day to rest there; three or four days to return to Paris.
“What, then, is there surprising in that?”
“She is dead.”
Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity, and, enchanted with this excess of zeal, came down to the first floor, for he was, in truth, working in his room on the second.
Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “here is my answer, my dear sir.

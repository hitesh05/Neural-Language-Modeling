Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that D’Artagnan had seen and heard everything; but he was pleased with his falsehood.
“In Stuart’s room?”
The queen smiled.
“There has been a crime,” said Monte Cristo.
There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father’s enemies.

He stopped at the door; Villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands,
D’Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the number three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented himself with saying, “That’s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the horses fully equipped, monsieur.”

“It is magnificent!” said Mazarin, thoughtfully.
“I mean active service.

“I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his convent.”
“Thanks, Planchet, thanks!” cried Athos, extending his hand to the lieutenant.
“An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family.”
Like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my weapons, I collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my body to the most violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I taught my arm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles.
“Mind your own business, wife,” replied Caderousse sharply.
Besides, to do all this, time is necessary—months, years; and she has ten or twelve days, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told her.

On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens, the sentinel cried out, “Who’s there?” and D’Artagnan answered—having first asked the word of the cardinal—“Louis and Rocroy.” After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost.
The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there; but they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other employment.
Albert looked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done.
“Sire, they are but men, and men are become both weak and wicked.
“You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back.”
“Ah!” said the king, “we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or not.”
“Monsieur,” cried Dantès, “I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.”

Lucien,” said the baroness, “I assure you I have no desire to sleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.”
Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall?
Do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion?
“I cannot explain myself.”
Yes, Athos, you may laugh, but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us.”
Villefort left her to the care of the women, while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person.

“He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Condé; he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not returned.”
God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in the name of that God I act,—remember that, wretch,—and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him.”

“Or a tiger?”
“Silence!”
“Ah, ha, that’s it, is it?” said Noirtier; “and why, then, have they not laid hands on him?”
He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had condemned her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with terror, covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of _his_ irreproachable virtue,—she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will,—she might at that very moment, perhaps, be preparing to die!
We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres.
The young girl rose instantly, but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death.

Go.”
Grimaud showed his closed hand, with two fingers spread out.
“They kept their word and never stirred,” said Mordaunt.
“I have the means of making myself feared.”

“She will be the sooner with her mother.
“The paragraph was correct, my friend.”
Can you believe so?” said Porthos, protruding his lips with contempt.
“Do so, then.”
“That man—wait a bit.”
It was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind.
“There it is.”
The king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the Louvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty in the business cabinet.
Oh, the wretched hours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw the deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you should drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”
M. Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous; he does not like Eugénie sufficiently.
D’Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned, but he had disappeared.
Oh, it would be a sacrilege.
The king did so, and the moment after, three muffled knocks, answering the given signal, sounded beneath the floor.
The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris.
don’t let us talk politics, my lord.”
“There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it was plain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in his hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze.

“Oh, M. de Villefort,” cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, “do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles.
In fact, the sack of La Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628, the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging generals—La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.
“No more ships!” returned Penelon; “well, then, you’ll build some; we’ll wait for you.”

‘If they do not bring us peace, we will give them war; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.’ And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Crete.16 But I, being only a little child, was terrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us.
I only ask you a simple question; answer it;—that is all I require.”

The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features, although his dress was easily made out.
At this, the delight of the mother was almost frantic.
Uncertainty is worse than all.”
“But, stop; do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us?” suggested Porthos, incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people.
The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers.
“That is right,” said the old man.
In the evening, about nine o’clock, at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor.
In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived.
The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features.

The Musketeer met with a superb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs clean and elegant, rising six years.
“I can count upon you, gentlemen, can I not?”

“Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck me,—of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched nothing.

“Command me, madame.”
“Does your excellency wish for a receipt?” said the major, at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.
“You see, therefore,” continued the cardinal, perceiving D’Artagnan’s composure, “that, as I have told you, the welfare of the state is placed in your hands.”
“And what have you done with your ecclesiastics?” asked D’Artagnan.
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.

“Imbecile!” exclaimed La Carconte.
“There has been fighting, then?” asked the queen, motioning to Raoul to rise.
On his part the king returned to his apartment.
“And now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos, “All for one, one for all—that is our motto, is it not?”
The magistrate trembled convulsively.

In a quarter of an hour we set off.”
If you had only to deal with four men, D’Artagnan, I would allow you to go alone.
“Yes, before witnesses.”
“Let D’Artagnan speak,” said Athos; “you know he always has wise advice to give.”
“Somebody has disturbed him, without doubt,” said D’Artagnan.
“Although in reality a Liberal, he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his button-hole.”
“Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.”

“Very good.”
“Yes, yes,” said Athos; “but they are only civilians—very bad marksmen, who will be sure not to hit me.”
“Under the other cardinal,” continued D’Artagnan, “we didn’t know enough to make our profits; this, however, doesn’t concern you, with your forty thousand francs income, the happiest man in the world, it seems to me.”
“As for me,” answered Porthos, “I wish my lord cardinal, in order to do honor to my house, which gives him an asylum, would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony, with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends, whenever his majesty next creates peers.”
“I never jest.”
Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive:

“Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet, every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome.
“Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly to supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution.
It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre, his prospects less desperate.
“In the first place,” said Athos, “let us leave this chamber; the dead are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent death.”
It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,—we say guillotine, because the Roman _mandaïa_ is formed on almost the same model as the French instrument.7 The knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts with the convex side, falls from a less height, and that is all the difference.
“Perhaps you are right,” said Morcerf; “meanwhile, who is in the Russian ambassador’s box?”
Albert rose.
The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration D’Artagnan enjoyed in the establishment.
“My friend,” said Gondy, “you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man; are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war, should we have one, and put at the command of the leader, should we find one, your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades?”
At three o’clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion) announced that the races were about to begin.
“In the name of heaven!” cried he, “listen to me; I have been waiting for someone who has not come.
Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion.
“Not the least in the world.
Besides, the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.
“My lord, the day after to-morrow is Pentecost.”
“Everything is ready.”
“There,” said the king, “that consoles me; they are not all traitors.”
“Probabilities are deceptive.”
If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped.
“Nay, be not discouraged.
“Here are ten thousand more francs,” he said, “with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make twenty-five thousand.
The king looked around him.
“To know if you have seen a young man pass, fifteen years of age, mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom?”
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days.
“Yes,” said he.
It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector’s voice called him to the visiting-room.
“And who brought you up?” he asked again.
Yes,” continued he, “a charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend D’Artagnan, who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal.”
The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars’ house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, moustaches in perfect order, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the courtyard of the banker’s house in Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.
As they approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk, surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in front of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del Babuino, del Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold, between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaïa_.
“No, he went out early this morning,” replied the valet.
The eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat, yielding to the impulsion, glided forward.
“Yes, that’s true; but alone as you are, you have done much already, and will do still more, I don’t doubt.
“Thanks, gentlemen, thanks!
D’Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and Mme.
Besides, we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose.
On the Eve of Battle.
“Is this that Bonacieux?” asked he, after a moment of silence.
“The _fingers_,” resumed the Jesuit, “St.
“Tell my lord that I’m going to sleep, and I advise him, as a friend, to do the same.”
Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at intervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former.
“Well; now will you return with me?”
On perceiving the cavaliers, D’Artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh; besides, his horse, he found, had a carbine on the bow of the saddle.
A poor Musketeer, a beggar, an unknown—who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in the world.”
“So,” added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object, “the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renées, the Ruggieris, and later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance——”
Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen.
as to that,” said Aramis, “we are witnesses.
“Can he be seen without doing so?
All his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.”
“Oh, my God, my God,” cried Mme.
What has become of him?”
What is there astonishing in that?”
“That is it; they are waiting for the cardinal, or rather for Bernouin, who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out.”
“Pray don’t mention such a thing,” said the count.
Porthos uttered a deep groan.
“Gladly,” said Albert; “let us call—I love him.”
The prisoner turned pale.
“What is his bearing?”
“As to that,” cried D’Artagnan, after a moment of reflection, “I shall surmount it, be assured.”
Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants.
“Yes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it.
“Oh, so much the better, we will fire the first shot together.”
“True, this story has diverted our attention from them.
Mazarin opened the coffer; a knife, covered with rust, and two letters, one of which was stained with blood, alone met his gaze.
“As to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy fool.
He would not, however, yield immediately to the young man’s request, but made a few conscientious objections.
“Ah, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”
This commissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and penetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox.
He married a woman who keeps a confectioner’s shop in the Rue des Lombards, for he’s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats; he’s now a citizen of Paris.
“I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort’s,” answered Morrel, “but I was of Madame de Saint-Méran.” Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz.
“And you think you can catch him?”
“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”
But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal, to increase the hilarity of the queen, Mazarin, a man of sense, and whose fear, moreover, gave him foresight, lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes; he went out after the coadjutor, settled his account, locked up his gold, and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls.
The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere costume.
“Farewell, monseigneur; should I not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days, I shall presume my letter will have miscarried.
exactly opposite the other!
“Every evening he shuts himself in there.
“The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible,” said Rochefort, shaking his head with an air of disappointment.
God forbid!”
“A thousand thanks, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “but I have an engagement which I cannot break.
From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose.
Come, will you do to-day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen?”
“Ah!
“What I have said, I have said,” answered Caderousse.
“What is the matter?” asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; “you seem more than commonly thoughtful.”
Chapter 92.
“Aha!
“I am sorry for it, madame, but I acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom I have the honor to serve.”
“Do not be uneasy, you little coward!
“The captain, M. Morrel,—he has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please God, it won’t be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty.”
The corvette must now, I think, be on her way to Fécamp, must she not?”
That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste.”
“Amen!” said D’Artagnan, getting into his saddle.
They dined apart from one another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
You come to demand money of me—of a Musketeer!
“That’s all well!” cried D’Artagnan.
In conscience, I cannot kill him; and yet,” added he, with a coldly menacing expression, “he annoys me.
“Why so, Planchet?” asked the young man.
The count looked around him.
“Which you answer according to your fancy,” replied Mazarin.
There is nothing to do but to send Monsieur Mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that, nor any other entrance into France.”
It was given to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the gate St. Honoré.”
“Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be difficult to contrive a better.
The door-keeper was called.
What!
“Well!” exclaimed Porthos; “I see nothing in that very extraordinary.”
“Ah!” said the sergeant, with a cunning smile, “you are Mazarinists, who are sent as spies.”
“You have been to Yanina?” said he.
“Wretch!” cried Milady.
“Ah!
by Alexandre Dumas [père]
Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar.
“No, sire.”
Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its head.
I have been looking for him, but without success.”
“Our swords!” cried D’Artagnan, raising his head and regaining his self-possession.
“But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle.”
As for you, who are young and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back your promise.”
“Never mind.
Alas, my dear mother, some have suffered so much, and yet live, and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them—on the fragments of all the hope which God had given them!
“But I have never been presented.”
On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy, which the two gentlemen heard.
“Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.”
We will cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.
“I,” said Aramis, in his most flutelike tone, “I had made up my mind.
“Ah, true,” said Debray, “you did fight some time ago; about what?”
Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?”
Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano to Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me away.
“I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,” he said.
“Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will give.
“Athos, you make me shudder.”
The queen touched with her lips the white, smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette.
“I beg your pardon,” said Aramis, noticing his awkwardness; “if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardener’s ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.”
D’Artagnan, I am your prisoner—treat me as such.”
I often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action, the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is no doubt the cause of my abject condition.
Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count’s large black eyes, runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he is sure to find some delightful present,—M.
“And does he not live in the Champs-Élysées?”
Porthos, who could never see anything that was not self-evident, talked to him as usual.
“We will charge upon you, then,” said he, “if you disobey.”
Broussel was seated at the table with his family, having his wife opposite to him, his two daughters by his side, and his son, Louvieres, whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor—an accident from which he had quite recovered—at the bottom of the table.
Respect to Fallen Majesty.
It must be; it shall be.”
My wife has perhaps requested permission of Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and he, as usual, has refused.
Vampa, when this man is satisfied, let him be free.”
Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.
One single, solitary light was burning there, and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selim’s flaming lance.
“And yet,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties_.” And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans.
“Whom do you mean?”
“Yes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies.”
“Favorably or otherwise?”
“How miserable not to be free!”
The Dinner Chapter 64.
The Indictment Chapter 111.
“What!
“I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron’s banking establishment?”
Planchet stopped short, staring at D’Artagnan.
“Well, let us set out.”
The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed, Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window.
Laporte burst into tears.
Grimaud made a sign that he was going away.
“An old gentleman,” continued the concierge, “a staunch follower of the Bourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had been the king’s attorney at Nîmes, and afterwards at Versailles.”
“No,” said Cromwell.
“I am the Abbé Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this Château d’If since the year 1811; previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle.
The duke had been five years in prison, and now to him, looking back upon them, those five years, which had passed so slowly, seemed not so long a time as were the two days, the forty-eight hours, which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape.
“I make a hasty resolution?” said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; “is there anything extraordinary in a journey?”
“I will offer myself as floor-polisher.”
It may be imagined that D’Artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest; before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to Aramis’s ear, and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement:
“I don’t think they can be in need of any.
“I love Edmond Dantès,” the young girl calmly replied, “and none but Edmond shall ever be my husband.”
“Ah!
“Rochefort!” cried the two friends.
In the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey.”
The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber, where he found his two guards.
Milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count’s; that it is I who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Wardes.
“Monsieur was already such a good theologian,” said Bazin, almost weeping; “he might have become a bishop, and perhaps a cardinal.”
or have you forgotten them?”
The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent, and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described, he replied to D’Artagnan, “I was not speaking to you, sir.”
“I?” said D’Artagnan; “nothing,” and he read,
“Make inquiries, Albert, but do not be angry without reason; make inquiries, and if it be true——”
He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service.
No, it had just struck four.
“He did well; but instead of breaking it, he might have used it to still more advantage.”
Immediately M. de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore their comrade in their arms.
Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left standing, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis’s adversaries who was only wounded, under the porch of the convent.
Since my brother’s assassination in the streets of Nîmes, I had never entered the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to come to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard.
“Do you know that I die to-morrow at ten o’clock?”
In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves.
“Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided me.”
“Are you fond of horses, count?”
“Be good enough to hurry yourself a little, monsieur monk.”
At this movement Mordaunt turned around, recognized them, and uttered an exclamation of savage delight.
“I must know, so that I may assist you if there is any chance.”
He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet.
“Don’t mention it.” The major drew an armchair towards him, and proceeded to seat himself.
However, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.
The tumult was indescribable.
He had a great desire to go to the window, but he dared not.
Here!”
At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went towards his groom, saying:
“By no means, my dear Porthos; that man is a messenger of General Cromwell; it would insure for us a poor reception, I imagine, should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant.”
Eleven o’clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain.
And yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural humidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners of the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who, from antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin.
It is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count.
“These three Musketeers shall follow us,” said he, in an undertone.
“Look at the arms.”
But Rochefort, who had passed five years in prison, had become old in the lapse of a few years; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct Cardinal Richelieu were now white; the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility.
Full, then, of this conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip.
“Where, if you please?”
“He is gone to Noisy.”
It is the work of another age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.”
He says you were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy; I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains.”
The young man closed the door behind him, and advanced towards the major, who had risen when he heard steps approaching him.
The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count.
The king turned his head away, as if these words had not been intended for him.
Are you superhuman?

Dantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed, whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body.
“Well, my lord, I sew up the paper in the ball and you, in your game of tennis, will send the ball into the ditch.”
With a heavy heart, D’Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.
For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman.
Am I to put this construction on your visit?”
Then they did not watch over this man.
“What are you going to say?
He determined to cultivate the good-will of the youth Raoul and, either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting, to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the present.
Here was the officer D’Artagnan was seeking.
Speak, command, I will obey.”
Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the steward appeared.
“In a handsome, running hand.”
“Oh!” said Porthos.
They arrived at Ablain without accident.
“And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution,” continued D’Artagnan.
A small, low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one-half per cent it had originally paid.
“Yes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so.”
“We are coming to the point,” whispered the governor.
“A _fleur-de-lis_,” said Athos.
He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling, declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before, near the palace.
“And where is it?”
Noirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.
Charles had heard and understood it all.
It was unexampled for a servant of the count’s to dare to dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Milady; “when I supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due, thou knowest it is not my own vengeance I pursue, but the deliverance of a whole nation that I implore!”

“Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a great deal of good.”
D’Artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively.
Perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I hope.”
First, sir,” said Caderousse, “you must make me a promise.”

The officer’s face expressed complete stupefaction.
“I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed,” said Cromwell, staring very fixedly at Mordaunt.
“No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him to your majesty.”
Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands.
The little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were directed to that door which Kitty said led to Milady’s chamber.
“I should think so.”
“I,” replied the viscount,—“I saw Castaing executed, but I think I was rather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same morning, and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.”
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer.
M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his hand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal.
“When my father, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing suicide, had anyone then said, ‘This man deserves his misery,’ would not that person have been deceived?”
“I have an idea about them.”
“But in returning thither last night, when fortunately you did not accompany him, as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people, who began to abuse them.
“Ah!” responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which displayed his white and sharp teeth.
“Monsieur!” cried the duchess, seizing Athos’s hands, “tell me this moment how you know all these details, or I will send to the convent of the Vieux Augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you.”
“That’s true.
“Pooh!
“On Saturday, if you will—Yes.—Let me see—Saturday—I am to dine at my country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No.
Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself?
“Speak on, madame, speak on, Queen,” said Buckingham; “the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words.

“I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat.”
_Ma foi_, there is no hurry.
“My Lord,” said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart, “my Lord, I swear all shall be done as you desire.”
But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets.
I was about to become an abbé, and all was arranged.
“For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest ambition.
“That’s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.”
“It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!” exclaimed the procureur, with a haggard expression.
“In the name of heaven, sir,” cried she, “what means all that is passing?
If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.”
What a noise about a Musketeer!
He had his Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII.
“In the navy.”
We should look like the two sons of Aymon, who had lost their brother.
Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor.
He likes good wine; now you have the key of the cellar.
“Remember, we are waiting for our turns.”
“What ails you, my dearest father?
“Well, be it so.
Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door, which after being opened to admit her was again fastened, and curiosity penetrated no farther.
what’s that?”
D’Artagnan looked attentively at the building.
At this moment a monstrous battering was heard.
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.
Consequently, Valentine came up to Noirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-Méran, who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.
There were nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who made war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against the king.
Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for you.”
“Idiot!
Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life by such a name.
There is the hullabaloo louder than ever!”
“I fear it.”
The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height and haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention.
“Raoul gives me much uneasiness,” he said.
“Shall I bring him alone?”
Today is the 5th of June.”
The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Athos.
“Well,” said Caderousse, “I should have sworn that he turned to the right—how treacherous wine is!”
“A letter?” said the young man.
“In that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.
“Those idiots!” cried Porthos, “they have not even pursued us.
neither you nor myself, but Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the room—indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.”
“I shall do the same.”
May God accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences!”
As the carriage stopped at the door, and Albert was alighting, a man approached and gave him a letter.
‘Take away Vasiliki!’ said my father to his Palikares.
“Ah, you are quite the pet of the ladies, Monsieur Porthos!” resumed the procurator’s wife, with a sigh.
And pray what would come to pass, supposing the king were five years older than he is?”
Monsieur Abbé, you are a great moralist.”
It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag, and was crying “Thieves!”
“‘“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the general; “you may not acknowledge Louis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal, and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to France.”
But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke’s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him.
“That is because I am not his friend,” said she, sighing, “but his victim!”
“About your own height, sir.”
Where did you place it?
Andrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and merely jingled a few pieces of money.
It is true that she had not, perhaps, been scrupulously faithful to him, but she had remembered him; that was something.
“Ah!” he cried, “by Jove!
“I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd; but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend, a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters.”
They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with the funeral ceremony.
“Don’t alarm yourself, my little Benedetto, but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance, and I will contrive it.”
“Ah, sir!
“I shall still have my place.”
“I do not.”
“Kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should I do so?”
Athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw.
D’Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal.
The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his pocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women, one of whom, justly dishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak, while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her misfortune, was yet rich with a few deniers.
They made him enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the door was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison.
“Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name.
“No, no!
In about half an hour the girls went away, and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars’ visit had at last come to an end.
Let me hasten to add,” continued he, “that the testator, having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the will will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.”
Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done.”
“He must have one,” said Athos.
Speak,” said Charles, attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him.
The Departure
He must be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.
“Count,” said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice, “listen to me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though he remains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend.
You will, in turn, enter it, my dear d’Épinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family.
“Gentlemen!”—there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them—“do you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons, whom he styled ‘the fairest of the fair?’ Pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs.
‘Come,’ said the captain, ‘we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship, let us now save ourselves.
One day you will be able to understand how all this is.”
“And what on earth are you going to do with it?” asked Athos.
I wrote to Franz—and were he here he would confirm every word—I wrote then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such was the name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously kept his word.”
“Yes, keep it—keep it.”
In France people fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the carbine, in Arabia with the dagger.
D’Artagnan grew pale with rage.
“Perhaps so,” replied D’Artagnan.
“The terrible moment had come, but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least.
The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before.
I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you—misfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree diminish my regard for you—I would wish to know if they have not, in some measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure?”
“I think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?” said he.
“We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.” Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer.
“I think not.”
“Ah!” said Bonacieux, “they took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that’s sacred that she does not know.
Not at all?”
“That person is here, madame,” said the officer, leaving the entrance open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.
Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Busoni.
D’Artagnan is for Mazarin,” he said to himself.
“And the queen believes—”
After having been so long in love with Madame de Chevreuse, you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy!”
The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.
Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.
“M.
A neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour.
I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,” said Beauchamp; “but he is perfectly unknown to me.”
“Doctor, doctor!
Monte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him pass, but he followed him.
“Let us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see.”
“Not so,” replied Danglars; “your advice is wrong, so I shall not follow it.
“My faith, my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, who detested verses almost as much as he did Latin, “add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits.”
“Pardieu!
“You are right,” said Milady.
Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme.
No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum, which was situated at the upper end of the Rue d’Enfer, and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child, while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and fled with all speed.
Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him.”
“And his name was——”
“I did not know that,” replied M. de Tréville, in a somewhat softened tone.
Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied.
Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board _La Jeune Amélie_, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him.
“In the midst of our misfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone.
“I was very wrong, my lord, for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my orders.”
’Tis a long time since I saw thee!”

He recounted, with circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there remained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small yacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward Porto-Vecchio.
“What do you think, D’Artagnan?” asked Athos.
Adieu, my lord.”
yes, had I died years ago; but now to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny.
“Monsieur Bertuccio,” said the count, “you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.”
Athos, who heard Milady’s voice, came sharply up.
“Curiosity—that is a terrible word.”
Ah!
“Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of moving or speaking.”
Do you expect news from him?”
“They will, no doubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire, for I cannot endure the sight of blood;” and she followed her husband upstairs.
“And this is the reason, monsieur,” continued Maximilian, “of my sister and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year.”
“Ah, ah!
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party.
Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen, when this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the other four cursed it heartily.
“Well, then, tell me at once what you want, that I may see if any arrangement be possible.
“Forgotten—he!” cried Mousqueton; “there’s not a day, sir, that we don’t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of Monsieur de Gassion, or of Monsieur de Bassompierre.”
Dantès took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him.
Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry.
“I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris,” murmured Danglars.
A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour.
Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome, Florence, Milan, and Madrid; it may be useful to you one of these days, whether you remain here or return to the East.”
You understand that, interested as I am in this affair, I cannot see it in the same light as you do.
“’Tis true.”
“That is reasonable,” said the visitor; “I have heard he had three or four millions.”
There is but one favor I would entreat of you.”
“And what did you do?” said D’Artagnan.
On the contrary, I gave you to understand, I think, that I adhered to the princes.
The count’s eye expanded; he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully, and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel.
De Chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men, which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies, so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches, where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment.
“I think so, forsooth,” said Rochefort, “and when you find any of them, you march them off to the Bastile.
“Does his action appear like that of an enemy?”
“For myself, on the other hand, my lord,” returned the governor, “when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand, since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up, dead or alive.”
I have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.”
“Apropos,” said D’Artagnan, loud enough for the servant to hear him, “are you satisfied with Olivain?”
“What are you going to do, my friend?” asked Morrel, arresting his hand.
“Call an officer of justice,” he said; “and stay close to me,” he added, in a low tone.
“S’blood; does that astonish you?”
We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d’Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs.
“Cowardly fool!”
Villefort looked at the count almost with terror.
“Yes, do,” said the duchess.
Andrea, surrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered.
“Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply will you strike our family.
I am a great captain—that I am!
If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you are old, I will be your son.
“But after all,” asked Porthos, “who is Milady?”
“Aramis, look at that horse!”
“Go, my young sirs,” said the sick man, “and may you both be blessed for your piety.
“Yes, let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former master.”
“Well?”
Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your views have a religious tendency.”
“He is a philanthropist,” answered the other; “and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity.
“But,” said Franz, looking round him uneasily, “where is the viscount?—I do not see him.”
“My lord asks of what country you are,” said the young man, in the purest Castilian.
We are carrying too much canvas.
“I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society, and we very seldom go out,” said the young lady.
“It is, nevertheless, the truth, monsieur—the pure truth, the truth of the good God.”
“I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and do not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow.
I enclose a draft for 5,000 livres, payable on M. Ferrea, banker at Nice, and also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, whom I have directed to supply all your wants.
He had not long to wait, for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin, but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him.
“‘Ah, yes, that is another thing.’
“Can we account for instinct?” said Monte Cristo.
“I have none,” said Athos; “but D’Artagnan will discover one.”
“Everything goes too well, Porthos.
The host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then he awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse.
At the door he found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.
Andrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his respects to the count.
As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre till six o’clock in the morning.
In matters of speculation, however, though “man proposes,” yet “money disposes.” From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a yearly rental of 500 francs.
“Listen,” said she; “I yield to your protestations, I yield to your assurances.
“Yes.”
“Yes,” said Athos, “magnificent.
I have seen him; that is he!
At ten o’clock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the king, and then a movement, similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops, ran though the multitude, which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard.
“Commend me to Satan.”
Yes, your Majesty!” cried the duke.
“I, who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de—”
“From Lord de Winter!” repeated Buckingham; “let him come in.”
Just then a patrol rode up.
Then he bowed a second time and retired.
It was as a prey to this hallucination that D’Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from Crèvecœur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.
“Kitchens?—of course—complete ones.”
“‘Why,’ she inquired in a hoarse voice, ‘did you invite him to sleep here tonight?’
“They are beating the general alarm.”
Mother and Son
Know, then, what I thought I had already told you, that in participation in this world’s affairs, more especially in their moral aspects, the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the East.
“I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans.
“No, I really cannot.”
“Oh, the women, the women!” cried the old soldier.
“It’s true, though,” said Porthos; “and the proof is that I paid twelve pistoles for it.”
Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall, springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.
Come, come, we must be off.
There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity.
“What was this young Corsican’s name?”
He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness.
“What wants your excellency of me?” inquired the man, retreating a step or two, as if to keep on his guard.
At last d’Avrigny slowly uttered these words: “She is still alive!”
“I waited your orders,” said D’Artagnan, crossing swords.
I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.”
“You know the Marquis of Saint-Méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her arrival?”
“I am he whom you sold and dishonored—I am he whose betrothed you prostituted—I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune—I am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger—I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet forgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven—I am Edmond Dantès!”
“Ah, my poor friends!” murmured D’Artagnan; “where are you?
D’Artagnan knew his part well; he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it.
“Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties.
“Return to Paris,” said he; “assemble the servants who remain there.
I have chosen a trade.”
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word.
It seems——”
“Sir,” said D’Artagnan, “you will go and release your companion, who is guarding the coachman.
“We will go on, gentlemen,” said the queen.
“With whom?”
Mercédès burst into tears; her woman’s heart was breaking under its load of memories.
“Monsieur Grimaud!” said the duke, “for your sake I beg of you, never come within the reach of my fist!”
He would have inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted with Porthos’s nor Aramis’s, and as to Athos, he had none.
At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out, when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England.
“Listen, Beauchamp!
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would have dispelled them.
“_Ma foi!_” said Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over, “what is the matter with you, M. de Villefort?
Tell me quickly; my time is not my own.”
“But, my dear fellow, if that some one recognizes us, if that some one cries out, we are lost; for you don’t propose, I imagine, that I shall kill that man of the church.
Chapter 7.
I adopt all customs, speak all languages.
Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships.
No, thank you.”
“We are forbidden to shed your blood.”
The Treasure
Madame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Monte Cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle, and across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion, which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color, she ascended the steps, saying to Morrel:
“I do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.”
And yet it appears, in spite of all your diligence, you have arrived too late.”
impossible?
No, no, I would rather die!” cried the queen, in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.
“Aramis?”
Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion; he was at the window, calling:
Milady, with a rapid gesture, opened her robe, tore the cambric that covered her bosom, and red with feigned anger and simulated shame, showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder.
At the second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his friend, the peasants had changed their costume also; and whether it was the result of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both, while he had donned their costume, they had assumed his.
“Unfortunately, it is a thing that I can’t perform at any time I choose.
“Whenever your majesty pleases.
They had seen no one.
Oh, Monsieur Chevalier, do you love that woman still?”
The Evening of the Betrothal
The Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.
“You will be here at half-past nine.”

The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other—not that M. d’Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only offspring, but M. d’Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme.
“Well, your Majesty,” said he, “you see how far my enemies go; they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me.
onward!” cried the Gascon.
In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied, the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil.
“Ah!” continued the count, “be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the _tavoletta_, and if he can send us an account of the execution.”
It was now Athos’s turn to take a sly look.
When he was only a few paces from me, I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade.
Idiots!
The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed, still with the same tranquillity:
This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s apartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get into some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured.
“Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of God’s justice.”
“You do not want your lackey?”
He believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: “It is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is doubtless a Musketeer apprentice.”
Expiation Chapter 112.
“Certainly.”
“Your mother has no longer either throne or husband; she has neither son, money nor friends; the whole world, my poor child, has abandoned your mother!” And she fell back, weeping, into her daughter’s arms.
When his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.
Then he mentally added,—“Still my unknown protector!
This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to Dantès, and seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all.
“Bazin, my friend,” said Aramis, “you don’t seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror, and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation.
“Ah!” exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed.
“It is nothing.”
And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening.
The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a striking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold Robert.
“Very good,” resumed Danglars; “now your revenge looks like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing, and write upon it, ‘To the king’s attorney,’ and that’s all settled.” And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.
“Consider, Maillard,” said the curate, “that I have recommended you to this gentleman, who is a powerful lord, and that I have made myself responsible for you.”
Then gloom settled heavily upon him.
“As for me,” said Porthos, “I will see to the supper.”
“True,” said Aramis, “so, as I am in a minority, I withdraw my proposition, so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneur’s resignation.”
“Immediately, I hope.”
“Well,” he asked, “that will do, will it not?”
Mazarin shuddered.
Ah!
Honor to man, this masterpiece of nature, this king of the creation!”
“The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me.
“What do you think of this?”
He still sought; but his eyes, darkened by death, encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton, still smoking with the blood spread over its blade.
Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible.
“Certainly, it is wrong,” said Monte Cristo, “but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.”
“How so?”
you would follow the escort?” exclaimed Porthos, in dismay.
Midnight sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady’s chamber.
Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard, and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips.
If she had been a great lady she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator’s wife, she contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, “Eh, Monsieur Porthos, you don’t offer me any holy water?”
A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman.
“Well?” said Athos, to the man, in English.
Felton walked into the sea up to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody.
“On a level with the floor.”
Mine host’s face does not please me at all; it is too gracious.”
I thought there were four of you.”
“Who?”
“Everything,” answered Franz,—“your voice, your look, your pallid complexion, and even the life you lead.”
The Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing was said of it.”
“It is quite immaterial to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle.
“Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and even then my vessels would become caravans.”
“Monsieur Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, “do you believe in fairy tales?”
The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo.
“Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.”
forty thousand francs income, I think you said.”
Cromwell smiled.
“Yes; my head is not only swimming but burning.”
“Oh, yes,” returned Monte Cristo; “I make no secret of it.
“What could they take from me?
Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving object drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist.
My spirit is willing, my head is clear, but this demon, the gout, o’ercrows me.
“Pardon, reverend sir,” said Caderousse; “you have saved my life once, save me again!”
“Oh!” said Mme.
It was seven o’clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear.
Oh, work, work,—my passion, my joy, my delight,—it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively grasped the hand of d’Avrigny.
At length they arrived at the famous room.
“Nevertheless,” said D’Artagnan, “the people are bowing very low to this person.”
“Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.”
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared, and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture, which, in sliding partly from the frame, discovered to view a small opening, so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea.
He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M. de Tréville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen.
“A woman of mark!” said Porthos, with his loud laugh.
Danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the door.
In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room, where they took counsel together.
“Very well,” said Milady; and she resolutely entered the carriage.
50197m
It is not Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?”
But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament, since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him.
I recognized Monsieur d’Artagnan.
Why?”
“Well,” returned Morrel, “it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but, already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame.
“Be calm,” exclaimed Athos, “for Heaven’s sake!
In an instant Dantès’ plan was formed.
Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister.
“Shall I take out any more of them?” asked Porthos.
The Hand of God
Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me.
“Downstairs in the decanter.”
He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of Porthos—that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.
“Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf.”
Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden?”
But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France.
“Certainly; I was there when he fell.”
“Alas!” groaned Porthos, “I am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year.
When they were within ten paces of him, D’Artagnan, who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.
“It is he!” cried Bonacieux.
“What spot?”
“For a thousand pistoles—just that amount, the beggar; not one too many.”
“Either the king’s or the queen’s.
“My uncle,” replied Mordaunt, with his harsh and bantering tone, “you are mistaken; you will not have me turned out this time as you did in London—you dare not.
“I wish to tell him,” replied Friquet, screaming with all his might, “that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way.
“Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but how shall we be happy?
Have you seen him since I left him?
“I do not know, my lord.
“What can you mean?” asked the procureur, alarmed.
“That’s well,” said the cardinal.
“I would, however, beg your Majesty to observe—”
“Yes,” said Athos; “let us give the money to the lackeys—not to our lackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.”
“What a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am!
“You don’t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?” said Porthos.
Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the self-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond.
After me it will all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps.
Athos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door.
A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors, whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder.
“Any one, except Grimaud.”
“Does that satisfy you?” said Athos to his adversary.
Morrel shook his head.
Planchet, leading his horse by the bridle, drew near to the gate and rang the bell, and immediately a servant-man with white hair and of erect stature, notwithstanding his age, presented himself.
“Still, then, I am a prisoner,” said Milady, looking around her, and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer; “but I feel assured it will not be for long,” added she.
“You will be assassinated.”
The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition.
Monsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.”
Toward four o’clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed.
“I will tell you, Morrel,” said the count, “that I do not need entreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf; he shall be so well spared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I——”
THE PAVILION Chapter XXV.
My God, grant that he may one day suffer what I suffer!”
whip!
Drink then, and do not meddle with what we are discussing, for that requires all one’s wit and cool judgment.”
“The word is rather hard.”
This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron-sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place.
But are you seriously wounded?
The little troop, without looking behind them or exchanging a word, fled at a rapid gallop, fording a little stream, of which none of them knew the name, and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham.
I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a wife.”
“Why,” cried the queen; “how is that?”
“Reverend sir, I am impelled——”
The coachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening his speed, and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel.
“Precisely; I was sure of it,” said Morcerf.
D’Artagnan became more and more astonished.
“With such things!
“What is done to infanticides in this country?” asked Major Cavalcanti innocently.
He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended across the rocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.
These conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme.
“Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning?
But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the commencement of the art—for generally husbands _will_ not see—you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world.
“An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death.
On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town, of which he was the life and soul.
The Place Royale.
“Adieu,” said Aramis.
I look around the boat, expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart.”
“What is his name?”
Madame de Saint-Méran has arrived, and her husband is dead!”
Do you know him?
All that he had heard from these three different men, Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen; and then Anne of Austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious.
After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced.
Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous.
In the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal.
His heart, swelled by the intoxication of joy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called Love!
One thought in particular tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and, thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercédès and his father could have joined him.
“Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer; though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though you should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear; even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.
“Tell him to come in,” said Mazarin, arranging his pillows, so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed.
This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure.
Everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied.
“It seems that I am named La Bruyere,” remarked D’Artagnan.
“Be prudent, Athos,” said Aramis.
The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and tell him I am nothing of the kind.”
“Matters go but badly,” said Athos, smiling; “and we shall not be made Chevaliers of the Order this time.”
Pardon me, and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace?”
“Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and description of the death they are to die.”
“You then love Haydée?” asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate.
“Good,” she exclaimed, approaching the table, “she has taken part of her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.”
They fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon.
“Madame,” replied D’Artagnan, “I have nought to say, save that my life is ever at your majesty’s service, and that I shall only be happy the day I lose it for you.”
On this conviction I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she speculated and lost.
Morrel threw a glance around, but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer, still unperceived.
“No, with a relation.
Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that D’Artagnan presented to her.
“But,” cried Morrel, “this purse is not yours!” Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning.
But is he really a prince?”
Heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire!”
“No, monseigneur, no, it is not he!” cried Bonacieux; “no, I was deceived.
You know I always did call you my child.”
“Yes; Malta.”
For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him.
“There,—that calash filled with Roman peasants.”
“He has done better than that—he has made himself understood.”
“But to return to these registers.”
On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England, was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal.
“The deuce!
Oh, how he will thank you!”
“No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die!
Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.
He has not been unreasonably exacting, it seems to me.
40302m
The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd.
“But yourself, monsieur,” said Athos, who began to be annoyed by this inquisition, “give me, I beg you, the proof that you have the right to question me.”
I must reach Compiègne tonight, or I shall cause deep anxiety to my family.
It was a signal.
“I beg your pardon,” interposed Monte Cristo.
“On my account?” said the young man; “oh, no, indeed, the count will do me the justice to assert that I have, on the contrary, always entreated him to break off my engagement, and happily it is ended.
Athos was right.
“M.
“My kind friends, leave me alone with Maximilian.”
“It is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him yourself, _tête-à-tête_, without witnesses, and that I shall see your Majesty as soon as you have seen the duke.”
The count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred.
“Toward Paris.”
Come, come, gentlemen, remove the fellow.” And D’Artagnan pushed the half-stupefied mercer among the Guards, saying to him, “You are a shabby old fellow, my dear.
the queen has not only one son, but two; then, Monsieur de Coligny was killed, and——”
The elder prisoner pondered the matter.
Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there had been no fixed meeting between them.
“From her Majesty, as I think.”
Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart.
“You make me tremble!” said the young girl.
“Well, my faith!
“By whom?”
Generally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.”
“Hem,” thought Monte Cristo, “he begins to conceal his losses; a month since he boasted of them.”
“Above all, she is very rich,—at least, I believe so,” said Monte Cristo.
Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course.
If his excellency will recollect—if he will think——”
CAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY
Mazarin, thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen, motioned them to follow him.
“Exactly so,” said D’Artagnan; and nodding to Planchet, he went out.
“That is useless.”
At the door he stopped to listen.
“And then, you know,” he said, “an idea, a supposition, is sufficient.”
At times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.
If these five men give themselves up we gag them; if they resist, we kill them.
Really, my lord, you are his nightmare.”
“I am listening.”
“Great God!” said Mme.
Indeed, when placed beside M. de Tréville, the elegant and noble courtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison.
This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery, where patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and night.”
The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.
“Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I was in the wrong.
D’Artagnan went toward a very small, low window, just large enough to let a man through.
“And then?”
Now you are exactly what I dreamt you were,—the man I always loved.
“He?
“Then let me go,” said Maximilian, “or I shall think you did not love me for my own sake, but for yours;” and he arose.
The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation; for, after having gained a victory over the Spaniard, it had just gained another over the people.
“‘Well done, Carlini!’ cried the brigands; ‘that is acting like a good fellow;’ and they all formed a circle round the fire, while Diavolaccio disappeared.
“Forward!” cried D’Artagnan, “and spur for your dear lives!”
This event might have three causes:
At five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the remarkable sights at Rome.
“Villefort,” she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner.
Short and stout.”
“With whom is he, then?”
“My dear count,” replied Albert, “I was announcing your visit to some of my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make, and whom I now present to you.
“Maximilian,” said the count, “let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed.
“Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?”
“Are on either side of the gate, which you see there.” And Andrea continued his plan.
You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs; spend them if necessary, but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve, that is to say, like kings.”
The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat, as Henry IV.
“Such women as I never weep,” said Milady.
Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post.
“Thanks, sir.
“Now then,” said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, “make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself.”
They might have remained much longer lost in one another, without anyone noticing their abstraction.
“The _Pharaon_!
My dear fellow, let them sleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale in their drowsiness, if they are disposed to do so, and pray do you remain in peace, who have no remorse to disturb you.”
“Oh, oh!
No one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers.
What do I want?
Next morning D’Artagnan was the first to rise.
The matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for Kitty.
He has a free will, yet he fearlessly condemns.
Albert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words died on his lips.
“I may go where I please.”
“An unhappy prisoner,” replied Dantès, who made no hesitation in answering.
“Because, in truth, Albert——”
Bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Grêve; it was at the Traitor’s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end!
These thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were not the less sad.
Besides, I have promised him your patronage.”
“No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him.
“Oh,” said Milady, raising herself, “I defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me.
ah!” said Aramis.
“Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be present at the combat.”
M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way drawn out again at night.
But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king’s example.
It was directed to “Monsieur Oliver Cromwell, General of the Army of the English Nation.”
“Don’t be in haste to celebrate a victory, Porthos,” interposed D’Artagnan; “never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering.
I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature, and that there is something fatal about her.”
He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon anxious.
Athos smiled, but did not reply.
Andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a hare’s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he pulled with considerable ill-temper.
Two shots were the reply to this threat; but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them; a third pistol-shot was heard, aimed by D’Artagnan, and one of his adversaries fell.
And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”
“And I, too!” exclaimed the young man, in a transport of joy.
Signor Pastrini, who had been accustomed to see them dine together, inquired into the cause of his absence, but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted.
“In French, in good French, my lord, take care of your accent; they killed six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian badly.
“Dead, dead!” repeated he within himself; and he felt as if he were also dying.
Athos and Aramis bowed and went out.
And in proof that he fears nothing, that he counts on nothing, he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin to your majesty without conditions.
“Why so!”
I will join you again at Marseilles.”
“My friend,” said Maximilian, “the voice of my heart is very sorrowful, and promises me nothing but misfortune.”
Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet; he gave them a tolerable repast.
Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then said:
“She is in the prison of Nantes.”
“Pardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my excuse.
Well, let us pledge the ring, but upon one condition.”
“Then it is settled?”
“I will not admit that word,” returned the young man; “it is at once cruel and unjust.
Whence have you these ideas of death?”
“You who love, and are beloved; you, who have faith and hope,—oh, do not follow my example.
“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”
“Would you dare to touch a cardinal?”
On his side, however great Franz’s desire was to allude to their former interview, the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it.
“I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan.
“If one of them comes to my side,” asked Porthos, “must I kill him?”
“To my grandfather’s room.”
“Yes.”
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Mme.

I love her; and I ask God and you how I can save her?”
“_Ma foi_,” said Franz, “it would be the easiest thing in the world; for I feel eagle’s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in four-and-twenty hours.”
“No, no, dear D’Artagnan,” said the figure, “’tis not the devil, ’tis Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left.”
“You were saying, signora,” said Albert, who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital, “that the garrison of Yanina, fatigued with long service——”
“Who are you, gentlemen?”
And running to a table, on which were paper, pens and ink, she hastily began to write.
Now I may hope that God will forgive me, since my crime is expiated.”
In the night he slept, but in the morning, refreshed and calm, he was inspired with his clearest views of everything.
“‘It is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young girl is charming, and does credit to your taste.
He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Tréville’s stables—one for himself, D’Artagnan, and one for Planchet—and bring them to Athos’s place.
Dantès seemed full of kindness.
“Charming!
THE PAVILION
Now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker, or our readers must have already perceived that D’Artagnan was not an ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place.
Your note of this morning has completely bewildered me.
You say you were on the point of being made captain of the _Pharaon_?”
“What the devil are you doing here, count?”
They were surrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates, and beneath which were inscribed these words:
He replied, however, in a tone of deep interest:
I told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you; why have you not done so?”
As for what you do me the honor to say, I presume you mean I was afraid?”
“I have heard,” said Blaisois, “that port is a very good wine.”
“I have told you that I am prepared for anything.”
“Twenty-three thousand francs,” said she.
“Tell me what it is.”
Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent.
D’Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a handkerchief.
“Himself.
“Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is a very rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name is Lord Wilmore.”
It is true I fought with tolerable success.”
Depraved as a girl, adulterous as a wife, an unnatural sister, homicide, poisoner, execrated by all who knew her, by every nation that had been visited by her, she died accursed by Heaven and earth.”
“D’Artagnan is right,” said Athos; “here are our three leaves of absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville, and here are three hundred pistoles which came from I don’t know where.
In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance—an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves.
“What I mean to say is this, sir,—that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred——”
“Who are you, then?” cried all the witnesses of this scene.
“Bravo!” said Aramis, “how did you manage it?”
He entertains a very high opinion of M. and Madame de Villefort.”
“That’s because you haven’t served,” said Mousqueton.
“Are you sure of it?”
But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Lucien’s visit and the curiosity of the baroness.
And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are ill-disposed to him, I wish to warn him, that he may be on his guard.”
“Let us go,” said Mazarin, “since everything must be done as you wish.”
Now, I have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all humility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little.
Mousqueton smiled disdainfully.
“But why did it not kill my father?”
“Think of my mother!” shouted Mordaunt, as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop.
“May you tell me whither?”
He let the jug fall on the floor, and it broke in pieces.
Albert remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point.
“Well, since you will grant me no more, I must be content with what you give me.
Two open...ings have been made in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...ngle in the second; which treasure I bequeath and leave en...tire to him as my sole heir.
Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity.
At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman appeared.
An error I readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never.
“How?”
They separated, and D’Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.
The fortune of war, my dear viscount,—the caprice of fortune; that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for.”
But the count completely baffled the procureur, and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming.
“You are right, Morrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your heart speaks to you.
“Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like glass.”
“Yet, had he come,” thought Dantès, “he would have found the treasure, and Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour leaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock.
The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and affixed his seal.
Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him.
“Yes,” replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace—“yes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does all he can to prove it.
“You understand, Tréville—an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden to fight, after all.”
This threat brought no reply.
No, monsieur, he has not a lady with him.”

“But, viscount, since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours, do not keep me waiting.”
“But I remember it perfectly,” interposed the darling Edward.
There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.
Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do.
D’Artagnan, more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbé d’Herblay, which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis, remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of his friend.
“You lie!
They both advanced beneath the trees, through whose branches streamed the moonlight.
Why, thou art posted here by Heaven!”
“We look hideous,” said Athos.
Calm and resolute, he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,—calculated its probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of strategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack, and won victory at a single thrust.
“With Albert.”
By the way,” added he in a low tone, “take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes.”
“Are you satisfied now?” inquired Valentine.
“The devil!” murmured the king; “what must be done?”
“But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.”
“That’s true.
The judges, proud of having a monarch to humiliate, evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves, and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head.
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme.
However, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the table there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad.
It seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw.
“You will see,” continued Aramis, “that it breathes irreproachable passion.
“As for me, I am sure of it,” said the duke.
“But I want to know in what way M. d’Épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person?”
“Was I not your second?” cried D’Artagnan.
“Ah, ha!” said he, “I hope all is over, explained and settled.”
“It often happens,” continued she, “that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life.
You said Anne de Bueil, did you not?”
Answer, or we charge.”
Order was re-established in the hall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another.
He caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I was thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud.”
“Five thousand francs.”
I beg you will remove your bandage.”
Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary.
“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated.
“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware; that is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.”
“My dear Athos, I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced.
Bonacieux, eagerly, and looking at D’Artagnan with disquiet.
You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?”
“‘Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?’
What an idea!
“That was true.”
Mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran; and M. de Saint-Méran is dead.
“Could you have been so cruel as not to bring her?”
“In the meanwhile,” continued the magistrate, “our codes are in full force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which, you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong power of brain to retain it.”
Peppino followed Danglars.
“Well, then, Monsieur Bernajoux,” said D’Artagnan, tranquilly, “I will wait for you at the door.”
And he drew out the handkerchief.
“A bottle, perhaps?”
My God!
“Then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him, four in his chamber, four in the antechamber, and that they never leave him.”
On hearing the password, Germain bowed.
“Is it then so terrible a poison?”
And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other’s arms; then Athos, looking into his friend’s face and taking him by both hands, said:
“True, true!” said Caderousse in a choking voice, “I was there.”
He took the money which Athos offered to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands, suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers.
I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am quite as incredulous as he is.”
help!
D’Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.
“Do you think I love you?” said Monte Cristo, taking the young man’s hand affectionately in his.
The division being made by the light of Bazin’s taper, the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint Denis.
“If you do not believe that it is my father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to be him, state your reasons for doing so.”
During the Ligue, about which Guitant was speaking just now, the people chanted nothing except the mass, so everything went to destruction.
Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which, if not large, was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents.
She entered the office where Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed, opened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase, conducted the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which he closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.
“Then,” replied D’Artagnan, “though I shall not have you, Athos, at all events I shall have that dear fair-haired head by me; and though he’s but a boy, yet, since your soul lives again in him, dear Athos, I shall always fancy that you are near me, sustaining and encouraging me.”
“Alas, madame!” exclaimed Athos, “to-day love is like war—the breastplate is becoming useless.”
“Do not advance it; the father will never repay it.
Then, internally, “If Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a decapitator.”
“Port!” replied Grimaud, beginning a fresh sum.
The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.”
Let us return to my ring, or rather to yours.
We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other.
“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of industry.
“No,” said Athos; “don’t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source.”
He inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor.
As to Aramis, he never played.
“Throw myself in the water and strangle him.”
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
“It is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however high they may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting severely toward them.”
“Do you wish him to read it?” said Valentine.
Dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.
He stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted.
The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply of guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to each monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument.
“Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady, nothing could be better.”
He let go the rope and fell upon his feet, without receiving any injury.
What would you do?”
Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual:
The cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but D’Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by recognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle and stopped him.
“How many shots?”
“Why, yes, the abbé runs a chance of being wet,” said the other; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter.
“And now,” resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, “how shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?”
He shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future.
You would like one that sails as rapidly as——”
The sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in Athos, who was always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society—those manners of a high degree which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions.
“No, but Franz has; for heaven’s sake, not a word of this before him.
“Madame,” replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie’s cheeks, “had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;” and he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count.
“I do this, Oh, my God,” said he, with his eyes raised to heaven, “as much for thy honor as for mine.
“You?”
“Allow me—allow me, sir,” said D’Artagnan, “to observe you are in error.
Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and hand.
There always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God; and see, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless as I am, that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well—I have powerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my account, may also exert themselves for you.”
“You are not an enemy of our holy faith?” said she, hesitatingly.
For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its true light, it was a grave one.
Tréville understood admirably the war method of that period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots.
Beyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine, was the village of the Catalans.
This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.
The man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.
Here, Monsieur Mazarin is everything.”
“Enough, I think, to fulfill your highness’s wishes on this occasion.”
“‘Certainly,’ replied the count, ‘are we not in Carnival time?’
“What a fool I was,” said he, “not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself!”
Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the subject.
D’Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard.
Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice:
“If the thing were to do again, I would again do it.”
D’Artagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired, after placing on the table the Spanish wine.
His look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the door was closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise.
“Why so?”
“Eugénie Danglars,” said Monte Cristo; “tell me, is not her father Baron Danglars?”
“No, wounded his horse only.”
“You shall not pass.”
“No, madame, I have not; but very likely I am on the road to it.”
“There’s a life for you,” said Caderousse; “a town house and a country house.”
“Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.”
“Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let me end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has pardoned me.
Bonacieux, shrugging her shoulders.
“I have never seen him put to the test,” replied Raoul, “but he is a Breton, which promises something.”
“Count,” said Morrel, “you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours.”
“No, but I have just met with a terrible adventure!
In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with yellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a cabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.
Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room.
“Yes, but I make hereby a vow in your presence, to employ all that remains to me in pious works.”
“Impossible.”
“Willingly,” answered the duke, “give me the pie!”
“One moment, yes,” answered the queen.
“Come, Parry,” said the king, “cease your tears.”
1.E.5.
“I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.”
You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of this country.”
What the devil!
Everyone listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about to speak.
“Yes,” indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from all his faculties being centred in his glance.
At these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer entered.
Whatever you say.”
Mousqueton also attracted attention; and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion, they said that he was Sancho, who, after having lost one master, had found two.
“Do not look, I implore you, my king.”
“I understand,” said Monte Cristo; “you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion?”
To-morrow the army of Paris will be summoned, the day after it will be here!
“I shall do so, if only in gratitude——”
“_Moderato!_” he cried as they descended.
Well, out of the five or six millions which form your real capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three or four times will cause death—so pay attention to it, my dear Monsieur Danglars.
“You know no one but Monsieur de Tréville?” he asked.
Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him.
You, who speak English like John Bull himself, are Master Tom Lowe, we, your three companions.
Aramis went to Cromwell’s desk, tore off three bits of paper of equal size, wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions, and presented them open to Mordaunt, who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis.
Albert looked around and perceived Franz.
“But his Majesty has judges, and these judges will decide.”
“A man.”
“I thought you said you were the chief?”
“As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca; therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can.”
It was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine’s name and pressing your hand.”
“I hope I have not made you wait too long, sir,” said the duke; “at all events, here I am.”
“Bills upon his Majesty’s private treasury,” answered D’Artagnan, who, reckoning upon entering into the king’s service in consequence of this recommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood.
These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense—it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.
I see it in the depths of the inner cavern.
Where is the man who brought the letter?”
Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,—a little nearer to the former than to the latter,—a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard.
“Here you are, home again, Raoul,” said the comte.
“But this creature must be a demon!” said Porthos, holding out his plate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.
“Was he young or old?”
I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M. de Villefort—I intend sending him away tomorrow, for he eats so enormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house.
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “a wager!”
“So,” said Charles, “he who knocks down there——”
They asked a thousand livres for him.
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.
“Speak out.”
THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON
“And who wishes to speak with me?”
Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward.
You will not oppose M. Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.”
“Do that,” cried she, “and you will have saved my life, you will have saved my honor!”
“The second—I heard his name by chance; for before fighting us, these four gentlemen told us their names; the second was called the Comte de la Fere.
“Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper.
“My jeweler and my secretary.”
Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that young viper?
“And your guardian, sir,” asked the queen, who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her, “what is his name?”
“And you, my dear boy?”
“Do you say the procurator’s wife is old and ugly?”
_La Jeune Amélie_ had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as little time as possible.
“Perhaps you think I shall abandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am married?”
“From the queen!
The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.
“Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free.
After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of barber.
“My husband had been at liberty these two or three days.
“My dear friend,” cried the lieutenant, “if you say a word I will blow out your brains.”
“‘No,’ returned the chief, ‘she is thine.’
A peer of France?”
Call Charles,” he added, addressing the boy who waited.
“Yes, we.
“Even on the field of battle, I have never done that.”
In short, up to this period nothing had been wanting to Tréville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch for it, and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand.
“So would I,” said Porthos.
“My God,” said she, “what a senseless fanatic!
“The others, my lord!”
Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity.
“Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,” replied Morcerf, “and that frightens me.”
And this explains how D’Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne, at the Hotel de la Chevrette.
“And I shall die in the performance of my duty.”
“Yes, they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body.”
Athos colored a little and answered:
“Do you see that street?
“Gramercy!
“Let us go and see your beggar, sir, and if he is such as you describe him, you are right—it will be you who have discovered the true treasure.”
“This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering, Morrel.”
Come, you are no longer twenty years old.”
And at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as usual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet.
“Very true.”
“It is not indiscreet,” returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of conviction.
“I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur d’Herblay.
“The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only acquired this information today, the 3rd of March!
They were influenced by hatred, by avarice, and by self-love; but I was base, and for want of courage acted against my judgment.
In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized him in the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of Justice.
It was the Island of Tiboulen.
It was, alas!
It was useless to search at night, and Dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning.
“I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination.”
Toxicology
“Do; but make no treaty—you understand me?”
Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door.
“To whom?”
Excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth.
“Oh, as to that I can speak positively, your Eminence; for as he came in I remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although I had believed it to be later.”
Maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their conversation, or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed state of apathy.
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, passing his hands over his brow, covered with sweat, as if to remove his last doubt.
On grand occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well.
“Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first sight.
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice Milady’s condescension.
In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations.
Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he had been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets.
“He is the evil genius of both of us.
As he approached, Carlini raised his head, and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man’s eyes.
“Oh, you, madame,” the cardinal hastened to say, in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming, “with regard to you, that is another thing.
“Come,” he said, stretching out his hand to D’Artagnan, “come, don’t be sullen, my dear son, for I have said all this to you, if not in the tone, at least with the feelings of a father.
and King Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these, added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on, formed a considerable body.
“But on what day will this ball take place?” asked Anne of Austria.
One individual went from door to door, bending under the weight of swords, guns, muskets and every kind of weapon, which he deposited as fast as he could.
Felton blushed.
There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara.
Fifty vessels were waiting to set out.
“If occasion requires, monsieur, you will remember that man who has just gone out, will you not?”
But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with signs of terror, and refused.
He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms; the whole body of servants, arranged in a semi-circle at a respectful distance, looked on with humble curiosity.
Winter’s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp.
Raoul, angry and at the same time uneasy, ran after him and seized him by the arm.
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.
“Oh, your excellency!” exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.
“Because you can and ought to return to France; your mission is accomplished, but ours is not.”
“Why did you not tell me all this—you?” inquired the brigand chief, turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look.
Mazarin’s face, smiling as it was, became clouded.
“How?” said Albert, whose brow reddened; “you think M. Danglars——”
All the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared as if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his hands upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts.
She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who thereupon requested D’Artagnan’s permission to retire, excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and charging his sister to obtain his pardon.
And D’Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to D’Artagnan to serve him as a safeguard.
“‘I thought,’ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her nature, ‘that I would give half my life for a costume such as she wore.’
After supper, when they are perfected, I will communicate my plans to you.”
“Very well, then,” said Mazarin; “enter this cabinet and wait till I come back.”
And he raised the medallion to his lips.
Everything in her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order.
“And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.
I believed I had a right to endeavor to find her.
“But you, sir?” said the queen to Aramis.
Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion; D’Artagnan, to be preparing his exordium.
The people listened to these words and let go the ladies, who thanked D’Artagnan with an eloquent look.
By the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence.”
“Sir,” interposed Blaisois, “I warn you that I can only swim in rivers.”
In his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this moment.
“He is in masquerade.”
“Impossible; my precautions were taken.”
“In heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if you doubt me, question me; I will answer you.” Villefort made a violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm:
If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in France.
To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife.
La Ramee stretched out his legs, Grimaud took a table-cloth, tore it into strips and tied La Ramee’s feet together.
Chapter 41.
our friends?”
“Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very resolute and very dangerous man.”
Are you French, sir?” said he to Athos.
And slipping through the aperture, he alighted in the court.
Mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was prudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears.
What do you think of that exploit, my lord?”
I shall retire and die tranquilly—at home.”
Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud, but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children.
Before she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides, examined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs, and even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound, skillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything considered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.
“In the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet.”

When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but for you.”
It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves.
“My carriage shall take you back.”
Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room.
“Yes; you are warned, vicomte.
The two young men bowed.
D’Artagnan was again in the presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments.
He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really Mme.
As to D’Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province, and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards.
Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned.
Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot.

His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of Dover.
His two companions were already on horseback.
“Never!”
“My friend,” said Beauchamp, in the most affectionate tone, “I should gladly make an apology; but, alas!——”
Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune?
“Do you want a map?”
Raoul blushed again.
After every action requiring exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons, howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives.
“Where is Athos?”
Believe me, madame, as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom—a heart devoted to you—believe that you have been the idol of our lives; that we have, as you well know—good Heaven!—risked our lives twenty times for your majesty.
Henry IV., when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls.
“Oh, yes, monsieur.
“You pardon me?” cried D’Artagnan.
“Yes.”
This smile appeared to D’Artagnan to be of bad augury.
“But how can you continue to receive us?” asked the coadjutor; “if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre Dame.”
“We shall see,” said Porthos, majestically; and the two separated saying, “Till this evening.”
“I will answer you.”
“Our magnificence makes you smile, count,” said Maximilian, who had followed him with his eyes.
It is not Fernand Mondego’s treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its consequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you for not using greater severity.”
“Not at all—not at all,” replied D’Artagnan; “let no one move.
Athos made him a sign to go to D’Artagnan’s residence, and bring back some clothes.
“‘Your health, Diavolaccio,’ said he calmly, and he drank it off, without his hand trembling in the least.
Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also.
Take my advice, renounce this woman.
“They have abducted her,” added the commissary; “and do you know the man who has committed this deed?”
The cardinal therefore rose to open it.
Near Paris, is it not?”
D’Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience, was beginning to attack the quick.
Edward begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead streaming with perspiration.
The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from Villars-Cotterets.
“At last,” said Aramis, “we are ready, are we?”
Arrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait.
“Impossible, monsieur.”
She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?” interrupted Porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue.
“Sir,” said Raoul, as he turned to leave the room, “I have thought of one thing, and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse, who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the prince.”
But Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated their pace by his.
“Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.”
How is it that I have never met you at his house?”
Fortunately, as D’Artagnan had thought, it was not dangerous.
Moreover, great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd; every opinion was openly expressed and chorused, so to speak, of coming insurrection, as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum.
Scarcely had they entered, when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor.
“Ah, you philosophize,” replied Villefort, after a moment’s silence, during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took breath; “well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do, I should seek a more amusing occupation.”
“Ah!
“And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.”
“Sometimes.”
He took a seat, and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary.
“Tell me,” he said—“tell me what you want?”
One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of Austria for Mme.
“You are right, Tréville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers.
“Well?” said the landlord.
At the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried, “Dear Madame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I will come down to you.”
“Adieu, dear captain,” said Porthos, “I shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony.”
“What?
He rose, gave his seat to M. de Boville, who took it without ceremony, and quickly drew up the required assignment, while the Englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk.
“How long?”
“All is ready for to-morrow evening.
One, however, fell at the duke’s feet, and seeing that it was intended for him, he put it into his pocket.
Bonacieux was the very life of D’Artagnan.
“I?
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked, ‘How do they execute at Rome?’ and you reply, ‘I do not know!’ And, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son.
“Was a villain.”
Quick, quick!
“Poor father!” murmured the priest.
“Has he been wounded, then?”
I had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume.
These poor creatures had no bad intentions.
“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”
“I pardon you, monseigneur!” said Bonacieux, hesitating to take the purse, fearing, doubtless, that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry.
“You are probably nearer freedom than he is, so it will be your business to get him out.”
The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy.
“I suppose not.
Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre, where the king held his review.
“You love?—whom?” cried Monte Cristo, starting to his feet, and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven.
The sun was in its zenith, and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.
Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces, the man ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys.
Supper was eaten in silence, but not in sadness; for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good-humor illumined the face of D’Artagnan.
“I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.”
“Do you hear anything?” said she.
“Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.”
“Bills upon Spain?” asked the disturbed host.
“I shall not trust to that,” said the lieutenant, “and I shall make for the Dunes* as soon as possible.”
“And do you really repent?”
“I hope you do not doubt it.”
“Mazarin again.
This evening your destiny begins to change.”
I do not understand you?”
Such felicity seems above all price—as a thing impossible and unattainable.
“Aramis, you know,” continued Athos, “is naturally cold, and then he is always involved in intrigues with women.”
20183m
There is to be war in Flanders.
Each of them had a ticket attached to it, by which it might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.
D’Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to implore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.
“And this king’s attorney was named Villefort?” asked Monte Cristo carelessly.
“And I, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “will go and find my messenger.”
“This cursed rolling!” said Blaisois.
He could not see it, but he _felt_ its presence.
“Yes, yes, Guitant,” said Mazarin; “Richelieu was a great man, a very great man, but he had that defect.
He has, at the request of your father, opened an account of 5,000 francs a month at M. Danglars’, which is one of the safest banks in Paris.”
It was empty, and Dantès emerged from the tunnel.
“It is the enemy, who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us!” exclaimed Athos.
“To the proof.”
Monsieur du Vallon, that worthy gentleman, for, with the exception of yourself, Monsieur d’Artagnan, there’s not a man in France that I esteem and love so much as him——”
“Well thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.”
You had no pity for that youthfulness, that beauty, that weakness?
In this place were together 60,000 pouches and 200 barrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the barrels were filled with 30,000 pounds of gunpowder.
“Ah, no, no.
“Here he is!
“You are my own darling child, Valentine!
“Listen,” continued Villefort; “you can now have confidence in me after what I have done.”
Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card.
“Well,” said Porthos to Aramis, “we must do something.”
D’Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds, and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de Tréville’s private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a cry, or rather a howl.
“Adieu, dear friend.”
Bonacieux, without any suspicion, accompanied her.
“Two, monseigneur.”
“I rescued from the hands of Mazarin’s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile, where he had been for five years.”
At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved, but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also.
“I was going to tell you.
Juxon was waiting for him impatiently.
Noirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.
M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of Père-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates.
Indeed, madame, you believe me too credulous!”
“Ah,” said Morrel, “one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.”
Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind.
“You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals, but did you make them?
“Oh, God!” prayed the kneeling suppliant, “protect my husband, guard my son, and take my wretched life instead!”
All were still.
“So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,” said the abbé; “for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be rewarded, and the wicked punished.”
“Impossible!” cried Madame Danglars: “a man may murder another out of revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.”
“Good Lord!” said another guard, who might have been thought asleep on a bench, but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation, “do you suppose that men can escape their destiny?
you assert a great deal,” said Mazarin.
“And I, too,” said D’Artagnan.
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de Tréville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it.
“Monsieur Bazin, the beadle?” said the verger.
She was a tall woman, with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls, such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens with.
‘Tous les méchants sont buveurs d’eau;
Depart then, depart, I implore you!”
“My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.”
It depends on the distance he may be from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour’s grace.
Franz d’Épinay started with surprise.
Still young—for he was scarcely forty-six years of age—he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful; his glance full of expression; his nose, though large, was well proportioned; his forehead broad and majestic; his hair, of a chestnut color, was curled slightly; his beard, which was darker than his hair, was turned carefully with a curling iron, a practice that greatly improved it.
“Oh, these are fine words.”
have you finished, Grimaud?”
“But you are deceived, Edmond,” she continued.
Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.
Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready.
The minute hand moved on.
“And why so?
“Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try to explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do not understand.
“We were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon.
“What do you wish me to say?”
“There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,” replied Faria, “but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison.
He was an Irishman—one of the most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.
Great God, she is losing her senses!”
“Egad!
“Because,” replied Franz, “you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by society, has a fearful account to settle with it.”
Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges, who was on guard.
“It was this,—that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.”
“If not unpleasant to you.”
And D’Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de Wardes.
The hour came for him to retire.
“Willingly,” said Albert; “but let us walk.
“I dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated.
But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximilian.
Do you know in what crime you are to-day engaged?
“Yes, but I have my breviary to repeat,” answered Aramis; “then some verses to compose, which Madame d’Aiguillon begged of me.
Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son.
“Who am I?” repeated Monte Cristo.
“I’faith,” said Rochefort, “there’s no great difference, I think, between a dead man and one who has been buried alive; now I have been buried alive, or very nearly so.”
Madame Danglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.
Grimaud, nevertheless, was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner; he wanted to inspire, not a sudden repugnance, but a good, sound, steady hatred; he retired, therefore, and gave place to four guards, who, having breakfasted, could attend on the prisoner.
“To wait!” replied Athos.
The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat.
“You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table.”
I am going to prove to you that I have not.”
“But how can Lord de Winter, my protector, my father,” asked Felton, “possibly be mixed up with all this?”
But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave.
“Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M. Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.”
You cannot understand the position we are in.
The number of lights had been intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.
“Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?”
He was dressed in violet-tinted velvet, trimmed with silk of the same color.
“I believe it.”
“There’s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,” continued the sailor; “and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour, but still it rose.
If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again.
Do you wish to go to M. Danglars?
What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?
She had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity.
But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance, which nevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed, the _trousseau_ of the bride-elect was on exhibition.
_You_, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; _I_ will be the avenger.”
“Ah, you see how it is,” said Athos, becoming still paler, but yet attempting to laugh; “I was sure it was so—the hanging of people is my nightmare.”
The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the Champs-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.
Then they embraced.
“‘Why should an exception be made in her favor?’
Then a piercing cry escaped from his breast, and he cried,
“To-day, monsieur?” asked the young man.
I have then about fifty pistoles.
Arras was encumbered with fugitives.
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries, “are we ready?”
Planchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and Mousqueton.
“And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are,” asked Athos, “belongs to——”
Two minutes a man makes four minutes.
It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial, and Dantès repeated it to himself, from one end to the other, for he had not forgotten a word.
“Oh, Heaven,” exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, “in what did he believe, then?”
Speak.”
Must I take anything with me?”
Have you not seen M. de Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, all fall?
“Yes, yes,” said he; “you disturb, you agitate the people who live in the castle.”
She _must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers.”
“We thought it dead,” he repeated; “I placed it in the chest, which was to take the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole, and then flung it down in haste.
“Stay!” said D’Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged him.
“Oh!
Nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said, I thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid it on his table, day and night, and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing, either within the house or out of it, he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself.
“And you will leave me then?”
While singing, Milady listened.
“The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor, and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at Nîmes.”
“Help!” shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword.
The Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment.
deuce take it!
Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was sent out, the lemonade which M. Noirtier had every morning, and he has escaped by a miracle.
She terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation; this was a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.
True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know, D’Artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Raoul.
The Absolution.
“I am quite ready,” said D’Artagnan; “but in the first place I should like to be certain of one thing.”
D’Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last.
Hallo, Dantès!
“With the queen, sir?” replied Athos, in his calm, vibrating voice.
Left alone, she arose.
“And one for me—the best for last!” cried D’Artagnan, furious, nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.
“But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?
“Oh, look at me,” continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy, “my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long fled since I used to smile on Edmond Dantès, who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old father.
D’Artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life.
“Don’t be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears.”
“The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.”
How will you have them protect you?
“‘See here,’ exclaimed Caderousse.
At the end of three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses.
“The Lightning,” answered the captain, “our felucca.”
“But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal; they are soliciting the hat for him.”
The _mêlée_ became general, but strength was on the side of the Musketeers.
“There is no need to do that,” said Franz, taking out his tablets; “for I saw the account, and copied it down.”
“Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.”
They may hear us.”
Do I, for instance, fare better?
Baptistin left the room.
Who can tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty?

“Oh, what a magnificent jewel!” cried the astonished woman.
“Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,” said Andrea, becoming more and more excited.
“Well, viscount, there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka, with four post-horses, in which one may rest as in a bed.
“I will undertake that.
“Ah, Beauchamp, I see you know something already; you will restore me to life.”
You received me very coldly.
The other seemed to meditate, yet he was more than half asleep.
No, mother; from this moment I have done with the past, and accept nothing from it—not even a name, because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another.”
Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.
“I am very desirous of being so, my lord, but I am totally in the dark about everything.
“Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as I was passing through the market at Constantinople.”
“I wish you may, my lord,” replied De Rochefort.
“Yes.”
Albert turned away his head with a sigh, and went to his own apartments.
“But I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to pieces.”
“I wish to speak with Monsieur Aramis.
“And are there no cardinals that can fight?
“It is for me to reply to that!” And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn.
For tell me, where can you find a love like mine—a love which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance word?
“I tell you he will never return.
Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary; in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon.
Athos was calm and grave, but Aramis was furious; the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself.
So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive.”
“No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of my only friend—of the cardinal.”
“I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these.
I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.”
“That is to say, she was there,” replied Milady; “but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent.”
“But,” said Porthos, with great wisdom, “that was impossible, for they would have killed the captain and the sailors.”
“Yes, yes,” she said softly to Valentine, “let her leave; but do you stay.”
“I have distrusted God; I could the more easily distrust you.
“Ah, ah!” said he, “what does this mean?”
Franz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino.
“Explain yourself.”
What is to be said?
He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château d’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”
“No, it cannot be!”
That’s very kind of him.”
“‘Yes, it is very annoying,’ said Vampa; ‘but we have not seen him.’
All four, besides, immediately broke off their conversation.
Sign it, then!”
“I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.”
“Later,” said Athos.
Let us see what Porthos has found for supper.” And thanking the captain, he regained the state cabin, where his friends were.
“I have received no orders on that point.”
“Then,” continued Château-Renaud, “since you have an establishment, a steward, and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées, you only want a mistress.” Albert smiled.
“Sire, it is fatality!” murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any human strength to endure.
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution.
we have the first throw.”
“This?

No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.
an astrologer predicted that?” said the duke, starting in spite of himself.
Mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing.
“Grimaud is a well-bred lackey.
“Ah!” said Mousqueton, who had ridden by the side of D’Artagnan without speaking a word on the journey, “you may think what you will, sir, but I can breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds;” and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends.
“Athos—a prisoner?”
“But,” continued D’Artagnan, “you shall judge of him for yourself.
“Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison, and that he had found out forty ways of escaping.”
“Non siete Spagnuolo,” he said; “non siete Tedesco; siete Italiano.”
“You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?”
“I recollect you were saying,” said D’Artagnan, “that after having demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.
“Yes, sir,” replied the count; “I have sought to make of the human race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals—a physiological study.
“You know, sir, that they wished to murder that good councillor, Broussel, the father of the people?”
This sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o’clock in the morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of M. de Tréville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal estimation.
Two held poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.
“It is very soon to leave me,” he thought, “but he follows the common custom.
I will now go up into my apartment.
No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and D’Artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever.
Ali,” cried he, striking at the same time on the brazen gong.
“What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray’s name is mixed up in this affair.”
“Yes, I do want a notary,” motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with a look of defiance, which seemed to say, “and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request.”
We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination, who are on their way to her majesty.
The king looked at the three gentlemen.
I was going to ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.”
Prove it, Danglars.
Having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation, the count, making a signal to Ali to follow him, went out by the side-gate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned, apparently without design towards Paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his house in the Champs-Élysées.
“Who will understand the signs he makes?” returned D’Artagnan.
To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.
Hark ye, my friend, I have disobeyed my first order, but I will not disobey the second; and if you move, I will blow your brains out.” And he levelled his carbine at Dantès, who felt the muzzle against his temple.
D’Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he had committed an error.
“Ah!
About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.
“No, gentlemen, it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians.”
“Eh, eh, eh!” stammered Caderousse.
“I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help,—come.”
I only wish he would let me take his place.”
The novice sat down.
Parry resumed his reading.
As our house is carried on very regularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight days we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the devils.
“The cardinal has touched me with his hand!
An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing drones.
“The enemy!” cried the king.
“Do you not know their history?”
How, sometimes, the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence.
The sudden departure of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much astonished everyone, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left alone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more embarrassing.
On that day, in fact, the four friends arrived punctually at the hour, each from his own abode or occupation.
In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more of escape.
But I also kept my word with him, and I neither ate nor drank.
“With pleasure.”
“Incorruptible!” murmured D’Artagnan; “I am unlucky;” and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy, and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him.
“There’s my hand,—I promise.”
The procureur felt more at ease, although he had learned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since the dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.
The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, “Rochefort!” The chevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately.
“I am ready to speak, my lord.”
“Your comrade?”
Well, it is a question of serving the king, the gentleman’s duty.”
As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere long become a mother.
“I know that I must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm; but what then!
“What a devil of a face you have, Porthos!
“Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.”
D’Artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it, making it over about a dozen times; and since he was supposed to have paid, like the others, a louis for his truss of straw, he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour.
“No, monsieur, be satisfied; nobody saw her,” replied D’Artagnan, and he related to M. de Tréville how the affair came to pass.
“‘That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear the imperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.’
“That’s Kitty!” said D’Artagnan to himself, and darted into the passage.
For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor alone.”
“There will be extenuating circumstances,” he replied.
All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone.
“And make La Ramee eat the pear,” answered Grimaud.
The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner.
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her.
“Well, what is to be done?”
“But if you don’t know this woman, how do you know her name?”
“Oh, mercy, M. d’Avrigny!”
Though Danglars could not see Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation.
Yes, that may be.
“Whither should I go?
Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said:
“Well, Albert,” said Franz, “do you feel much inclined to join the revels?
It was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his servant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him.
“What is it, sir?”
“Has this woman been relating her crimes to you?
“Proceed!” said he to the host.
“How was this jealousy manifested?
But Athos heeded not his advice.
“What the devil do you see so bad in it?” said D’Artagnan.
At length she rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on Valentine.
No, indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected.
“You are right,” said the latter; “M.
Gimblou, a glass of wine.”
“Ordination!” cried D’Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess and Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon the three persons before him.
“Yes.
All eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with anxious attention.
It is, then, Buckingham!” cried Felton, in a high state of excitement.
Athos replaced his in his belt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands, returned them to their scabbards.
It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with their hope.
Day was now advanced; all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened, one after the other.
it is his son!”
The party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by de Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts.”
D’Artagnan’s bearing became still more imposing.
“But this dinner was not intended for you alone, Porthos?” said Aramis.
The felucca is waiting for us, you know; let us leave to-night, we have nothing more to do here.”
The Workmen.
“Silence!
“Your excellency has given me a louis on account.”
“How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster?
“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when your majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty.”
“Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.”
And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher?”
When everything was ready, the gallows hung in the middle of the room, the loop made, and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish, in order to select the finest specimen among them, he looked around for his piece of glass; it had disappeared.
The sergeant drew near to Planchet.
“Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, begging me to attend the Opera.”
Ho!
“What occupies him in England?”
Poor woman!
“In short,” said D’Artagnan, “this has been the will of God.”
“When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say nothing.”
“Well,” said the queen, biting her lips, whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise, “what is the desire of my people?”
Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at all remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible; while D’Artagnan turned the two horses into a lane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts.
The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy, a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth.
“But you,” answered Porthos, “seem to me agitated.”
“I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I.
Will you examine them.”
D’Artagnan,” continued Athos, “you, who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it.”
“Precisely, monsieur,” replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.
“Why should he doubt it?” said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud.
That same evening M. de Tréville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and D’Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning.
You are still yourself as now, and yet you are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are but an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than apoplexy.
“Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?”
“Now, my young friend,” said he, “England is all our own.
“Monsieur de Comminges,” he said, “pardon me; we both are servants of the queen, are we not?
I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April, 1647; and as the invitation was for September, 1646, I couldn’t accept it.
He then proceeded, with his usual calm gait, to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery, who, foreigner as he was, could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs.
“You are a born diplomat,” returned Franz; “go and try.”
He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdinière.
“You here, sir!” he exclaimed; “do you, then, never appear but to act as an escort to death?”
“_Canimus surdis_,” replied the king, continuing the annotations in his Horace.
“But will you undertake to speak to the father?”
“Héloïse!” he cried.
Chapter LXVI.
“Egad!
You can understand, can you not, that to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have intruded on the solitude of a friend—you can understand that, to have done all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather by a terrible conviction.
Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio with terror.
“I hope so,” was the reply.
“The same.”
He shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream.
And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you, I hope, that I remain your friend, as well as that of—what the devil are their names—D’Artagnan and Porthos?”
I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence, as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended.
“Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?”
Chapter XLVIII.
adieu!”
there is your proud and selfish nature.
“I have,” replied Morrel.
I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès.
“No; I agree with you there.
And the disappearance of his money; how am I to justify it if I am here?”
On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness, and heard this oath of vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.
So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city, and in half an hour’s time he stopped before a little isolated house.
The abbess introduced them to each other.
“Do you hear him, Valentine?” exclaimed Haydée; “he says that through me he will suffer—through _me_, who would yield my life for his.”
“Truly?”
“Come, take them,” and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his hand.
“How hot you look, my good Barrois,” said Valentine.
“Here are two hundred,” said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of Caderousse.
And now go, Mordaunt.”
“I saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were all my mother’s servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments, jewels, purses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction.

We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he related to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety; but in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital.
Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we bring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage, and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their country.”
D’Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis personally, he passed before them without speaking or looking—indeed, as if he had never seen them before.
“I have no horse,” said D’Artagnan; “but that is of no consequence, I can take one of Monsieur de Tréville’s.”
Ah!
He began gathering the grape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes, and won the heart of the gardener.
“You reject this means of information, then?”
Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry, “Long live Broussel!” “Down with Mazarin!” and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at, spat upon and even beaten.
Chapter 23.
“Yes,” said he, “I came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.”
I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle.
“A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.”
Then bending again to Raoul, he whispered: “Above all things do not divulge your name.”
He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps.
“Good.”
“Is it not true, Aramis?” said Porthos, turning toward another Musketeer.
“You are about my height, Pierre,” said he.
This will has already constituted Haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in England, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants, may still amount to sixty millions.”
“Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive you.
He had within his reach his pistols and carbine, and Ali, standing near him, held one of the small Arabian hatchets, whose form has not varied since the Crusades.
I know an Italian prince, rich as a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month.
Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès.
Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write, relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.
“Halloo, major!
Come, answer freely.”
“Look here,” resumed D’Artagnan; “here is Monsieur de Bragelonne, who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comminges.”
“Then I shall die, sword in hand,” said Charles.
Come, my friends.”
you will find good cigars on the centre table.
“My dear Bazin,” said D’Artagnan, “I am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church!”
“‘“Our coachman is a member of the club,” said the president; “we shall be driven by a State-Councillor.”
“Ah!
Yes and no.
“Another hope defeated!” said the count.
“And now,” said the duke, raising it still six inches higher, “jump for the king.”
Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.
It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal’s Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
“Well, be it so—let us part,” said Mercédès, folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere.
“How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left?”
He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead.
The groom returned to the carriage.
“It is well; be friends,” said the tutor; “young as you both are, you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet.
“You will take your musketoon and your pistols.”
“And you think,” said Aramis, “he will consent to appear before such a tribunal?”
“I promised him to wait,” replied Morrel; “and I will wait.”
But Peppino, instead of answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count’s hand, and covered it with kisses.
The clock of the Invalides struck one.
“Then let us be as we used to be; let us be open with each other.
Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated.
I knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman.
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound her hands and feet.
His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.
“An expedition, sir?” asked the steward, whose roses began to change into lilies.
Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop, through fear or by persuasion, consent that he should enter in the bishop’s place, and clad in his sacerdotal robes, the prison at Whitehall.
I have never seen her from that day.
He hurt my shoulder.
Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he seated himself on the stool beside him.
“And wherefore fire?” said the colonel; “every one has yielded.”
“Not at all.”
The abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape.
Now let us try to take our revenge.”
He bowed.
Villefort placed the arm of Madame de Saint-Méran within his own, and conducted her to his apartment.
“The first person who sees her.”
“That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercédès and my deceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and—I have revenged myself.”
C’est bien prouvé par le déluge.’1
“This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place he knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...essed of ingots, gold, money, jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this treasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns, and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small creek to the east in a right line.
Albert gathered up his papers hastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord, and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the stairs.
Ali left the room.
“Alas, I guess it.
“Is he not the son of General d’Épinay who was on our side, and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of Elba?”
“Yes, yes,” he said, “I will pardon you if you tell me all.”
“Well, well,” said Andrea, “that isn’t a bad idea.”
“Is it you?” said he; “I am here.”
For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden.
The abbé took the note.
HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT Chapter XXXIX.
“The devil take the madman!” murmured M. de Tréville, “unless,” added he, “this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in his purpose!”
There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table, so La Ramee, when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud, presented a type of perfect bliss.
He was still comparatively young, he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly plausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world, even life itself.
he has grown a good deal, it seems to me.” And he sat down in the hall, choosing a conspicuous place.
“As to that, madame, I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne, my inheritance, which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte.”
“He is at my house.”
“_Certes_,” cried Athos, “you are the best-mounted poet of France or Navarre.”
“In my office, or in the court, if you like,—that is the surest place.”
Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away.
“Of the evil you have done,” said the voice.
“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”
Yes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,—he was an under-clerk to the good M. Morrel.
At length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped before an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form, massive, and isolated.
Tomorrow, then, monsieur—tomorrow.”
The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again.
Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished.
I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight.
“Mad, you mean, don’t you?”
As they stopped at the door of the cardinal’s study, D’Artagnan was about to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder.
“But can he understand you?”
The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his memory.
“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she must have received an education herself.
“Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G—— on the part of her friend the vampire.”
The crowd opened and closed again, undulating like a stormy sea, and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Athos.
If anything yet remains of that great, that sublime king, Henry, of whom you have just spoken, he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself.”
“She is found,” said Milady.
No one could have said what caused the count’s voice to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased.
“He must be called upon, and so ascertain if the thing be true or not.”
Morrel groaned.
“Well, then, we will go into Paris.
“In some parts of France—yes, excellency.”
Athos was not altogether the queen’s dupe, but he was not a man to run away on suspicion—above all, when distinctly told that he should see his friends again.
“Fernand,” cried he, “of my hundred names I need only tell you one, to overwhelm you!
Monte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar, “Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who, after having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call it his own.” The carriage was prepared according to orders, and stepping lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.
Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns.
“Send at twelve,” said Danglars, smiling.
Chapter XXXII.
The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Académie Royale.
“Sweet child,” murmured Monte Cristo.
Debray did not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of Eugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his heart.
“You were saying, sir——” said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark.
Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini, when that worthy presented himself.
But he had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him.
The great are often ungrateful.”
“His poor mother,” murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear.
And the count, humming an air from _Lucia_, went to sit down on a bench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts.
Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve, abandon the exterior, the material appearance for the invisible principle, for the invisible principle is everything.
“Go on.”
“We must see what it is,” said Grimaud.
And your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at liberty.
At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.
And now, whenever he wishes——”

Besides, D’Artagnan passed the evening with me.”
“And what favor, pray?” asked Lord de Winter.
“But that’s impossible!

I believe the fellow is here on his own account, for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vindictive.
“Patience!” replied Mazarin, with his Italian smile; “that may happen one day; but in the meantime——”
“My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving here—you did see him, I think?”
D’Artagnan and Porthos, armed with their swords, and Athos and Aramis, each carrying a concealed poniard, approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuart’s prison.
SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS Chapter XXXIV.
“I rest?
“I have.”
I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d’Artagnan, say a great deal about them.”
“He is here, and here,” said she, touching her eyes and her heart.
“Where is he?”
“What, you ‘_had_ one’?
“Now, sir,” said D’Artagnan, wishing to change the conversation, “here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier.
So then—”
Planchet shook his head and said nothing.
“Gentlemen,” said he, “M.

Maximilian’s Avowal
I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will begin.”
I saw my father’s hand tremble.
Then he took Milady in his arms, and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken.
“Which?”
I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same spot where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the compliment I have related to you.
“Let him have his say, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, with a smile of sadness and contempt.
“To tell you that you are free, your excellency.”
1.E.6.
“I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo” said the young man.
The young man pressed his lips on the same spot, on the old man’s forehead, where Valentine’s had been.
He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at Auteuil, and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of Valentine’s death.
“Enough, sir,” muttered the cardinal, “you have said enough; where is the treaty?”
Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which, next to that of the Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies.
“Explain yourself, count!” cried the queen, whose anxiety grew greater every moment.
I was going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you gallop past.
“I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger.
Then, wretched creature, then you tempted God a third time.
You understand, my dear baron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps, some plot against you.” Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing-room.

The breakfast at M. de Tréville’s was as gay and cheerful as possible.
“At some future time I will tell you all about it.”
“Oh, M. de Morcerf,” interrupted Morrel.

I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M. de Saint-Méran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.”
“‘Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year 1247 of the Hegira.
The Duc d’Orléans visited the posts.
“It appears, too, you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne.”
However, as far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant—you, who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.”
“Come, dear D’Artagnan, look up a little!
You will tell me that I am a living being, and not a code—a man, and not a volume.
“Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?”
“I?—what for?
D’Artagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception, but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous.
The other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal duke.
By adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances, he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which, for the rest, the queen’s letter, short but explicit, gave him the clue.
“There is one man for whom I can answer, if he will speak out.”
Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know what has become of our young man.”
“Revenge, for instance!” observed Franz.
It was a name that too often resounded in her majesty’s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize it; yet she remained impassive, looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens, either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth.
In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze; then all at once it ceased.
Monsieur Mousqueton!
“Jesus Dieu!” he cried; “one of them is trembling with fever, having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours, and the other is a knight of Malta, as timid as a young girl; and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors.”
“Me, also!” repeated Porthos.
“Grimaud,” said Athos, “put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk.”
Then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with the same accuracy.
Thinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse, D’Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at St. Germain.
so you are here!” cried the officer, in the tone of ill-humor habitual to him; “what the devil are you doing here?”
“Deuce take it!” he thought to himself, “how can I take care of both?
Now, as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own opinion, M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly.
“And you include me in the expression everyone—many thanks!”
We ought not, therefore, I think, to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition.
“Right.

During twenty he had been lieutenant, their captain since the night before.
“What!
He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine, at length he sent away all his doctors, declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment, and came to Paris, where the fame of his wit had preceded him.
“Avenged yourself,” said the baron.
the king’s authority will put all this to rights.”
I bitterly reproach myself, I assure you.”
D’Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.
It is true that all was like a dream, but it was not the less frightful.
“What did you do then?”
She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty.
“Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan, emptying his glass, “that is all I wanted of you.
“And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?” inquired Emmanuel.
“Do you really think so?
You had the fortitude to regain the house, assisted by your nurse.
Although weakened, the young man’s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners—liberty!
“Faith, my lord, but indifferently.”
Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selim’s fiery lance.
As he was passing the Allée des Veuves, he thought he saw the count’s horses standing at Gosset’s shooting-gallery; he approached, and soon recognized the coachman.
They all four entered the tent; they had no plan ready—they must think of one.
“Ah,” returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was doing.
‘Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes!’
He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that.
“Your eminence may be perfectly easy,” replied D’Artagnan; “they will not touch a hair of your head.”
“He will very probably come of his own accord,” said Morcerf.
Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and then rising, said, “Within six months, if I am not dead, I shall have seen you again, madame—even if I have to overturn the world.” And faithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.
You give away horses worth a thousand louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first handsome woman you think of!”
And Athos, bowing, retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece, a spectator of the scene.
This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Duc de Chaulnes, who has sent for him.
Having escaped these dangers, they returned by the main road to Boulogne, at Abbeville, and followed it step by step, examining every track.
“What is that news?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Really, this is too absurd,” said Villefort.
At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber, but seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides, they hesitated about going farther.
“‘I swear, captain,’ replied I.
All we have hitherto done in the matter has been child’s play.
“If you would permit me—” said D’Artagnan, with timidity.
I have no business in London.”
The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it.
“Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.
“Well!” insisted the Count.
D’Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy.
Athos became thoughtful.
I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall think—for how do I know to the contrary?—that this house, which has remained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it.”
“And her mother, Madame de Saint-Remy, have they yet told her of it?”
The imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame—a slight storm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely deceived, and his error was not of long duration.
“Well?” she said at length, “do you not answer me?”
“But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort’s; but let’s get back to the subject.”
Do you remember how he cried, ‘On, D’Artagnan, on, I am taken’?
“M.
“Has returned to the Louvre.”
He produced the ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might, on his return at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the presence, even in the harem.
No, no, never!” cried Milady.
But no, his heart is beating.
“Well,” said Milady, “if you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I will give you a thousand pistoles.”
Milady was all attention.
“And wherefore has he not been to see me?”
“Come and open, then!” cried D’Artagnan to the man with the scythe, taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle.
Straw-work?
Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into niches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs.
“You are very young, Monsieur Mordaunt, for this difficult task of ambassador, in which the oldest diplomatists often fail.”
Milady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope—her only means of safety.
“Bad, monsieur, bad!” replied the king; “I am bored.”
“They are hot royalists,” said Groslow.
free!
He had good cause to do so; the pain I gave him must have been atrocious.
Bonacieux saw that he hesitated.
“Well,” said Morcerf, “I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself away to forward your wishes.
“Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others.”
“Have you no information as to his abiding place?”
Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect.
The interests of that kingdom and those of England, though taking now diverse directions, are very nearly the same.
So you have seen the arm, that was all.
It is so hot at Marseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever.
I depend upon you to escort me home.
“But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?”
“Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?”

“This is my story, then.
They have some business with you, I think, from what they told me the day before yesterday.
Here’s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond.”
Monte Cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open, extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear.
You are placed on high, my Lord, but tremble!
A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described.
“Who learns it from whom?”
When a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished; when one is a murderer, to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan.”
“It appears, however,” said Lord de Winter, “if there are any measures to take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law.”
“But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position?”
madame,” replied Monte Cristo, “you must not ask of us, the manufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question.
“All for one, one for all.”
Then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him—they represent the wealth of the country; nor the nobles nor the princes, who are the military power of France.”
No sentinels, no one at any of the windows.
“To-morrow we shall be at Boulogne.”
Charles perceived it and took his hand.
Why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles’ worth!
“He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.”
“Vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes, Et qui trainez des jours infortunés, Tous vos malheurs se verront terminés, Quand à Dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes, Vous qui pleurez!”

“Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright, the most rigid magistrate on the bench?”
If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements, Aramis, those of London are mine.
“Good,” he said.
At that moment Bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.
“I’ll try,” said the duke.
“Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.”
Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread.
“Well enough to question him in that language?”
Mazarin disappeared as they rose from table.
I agree to Athos’s plan.

The first squadron moved off; the second followed, and descended from the plateau.
Do you know, count, that persons of our time of life—not that you belong to the class, you are still a young man,—but as I was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year.

“Sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest, but the most graceful woman in France.”
Acknowledge, that if Albert is brave, he cannot be a coward; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning, and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise.”
“Oh, never fear!
The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian, should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief.
40262m
Upon my honor and by the holy cross; I only regret it because she was a woman.”
“Ah, you do well to ask,” said Eugénie, laughing; “I forgot that I was Hercules, and you only the pale Omphale!”
Once outside, he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.
“She is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but you—if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.”
“And here is your fowl.”
All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity, without the police interfering in the matter.
Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been.
“Fourteen years!” repeated the count.
Olivain advanced, retired, then made his horse rear—turned it and then, struck to the core by shame, leaped, as Raoul had done, only repeating:
Athos laughed.
“Now I understand,” he said, “why you had me brought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this subterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count?
“Tomorrow evening, at five o’clock.”
“_Ma foi!_ you frighten me.
“I was brought up here.”
Perhaps you had a spy at your heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal, will thus seem legitimate.”
Each of them took one, which Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.
“It would indeed be strange if——” she checked herself.
“Go on, then,” replied the count.
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder readily.
Dantès continued his search.
“Then I am also a puzzle to your mother?
“Ah,” replied Monte Cristo, “since that is the case, I will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration.”
“You think you were.”
“What do you propose to me, d’Avrigny?” said Villefort in despair; “so soon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become necessary; and an inquest in my house—impossible!
“Do not think so, Brisemont,” said D’Artagnan; “do not think so.
Andrea shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse’s ideas.
Scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye.
“Come, my friend,” he said, thrusting his hand through the opening, “where are we going?”
“He is most likely at my hôtel.
“And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?”
“Do not dig any more,” said the voice; “only tell me how high up is your excavation?”
“I am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.”
At the moment he opened the door, the three Musketeers and D’Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at the top of the staircase.
The host and his wife were standing on the steps, whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk.
“I own to you that that young man’s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep.
“Well done, Planchet!
“By whom?”
“Here, monsieur,” said the cardinal to the young man.
Let us sit down to supper.
“Ah!” cried he, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “ah!
“You have not guessed rightly.
“I must own,” said Aramis, “I am like the Comte de la Fere—I can see nothing remarkable about it.”
“Take some, then, and come back immediately.”
The ball struck the animal full in front.
“Only seventeen months,” replied Dantès.
Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had recovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came.
He opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual, but with his eye inflamed and almost wild.
“A genuine Englishman, your eminence.
“Not at all.”
“Alas, do you love nothing else in me?” asked D’Artagnan.
“There is one thing the queen has not signed—her assent to the treaty.”
“They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”
“My dear friend,” said the baroness, while the two young people were shaking hands, “I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti.” Danglars kept up the title of prince.
“The Comte de Rochefort.”
’Tis not for me, a private individual, to disunite a queen from her kingdom.
The duke had already begun to descend.
The soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity.
You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results of this accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man.
“A capital blow you gave!” cried Porthos.
The soldiers were playing or sleeping; two of them were singing in a corner, out of tune, the psalm: “On the rivers of Babylon.”
“But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold.”
It struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the Rue aux Ours.”
De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man; and the Spaniard, who had advanced to meet Raoul, aimed in his turn, and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm, similar to that of a blow from a whip.
“Ah!” said Eugénie.
“Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.”
“To be my second.”
D’Artagnan appointed eight o’clock at Athos’s residence.
“Good!

“Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,” replied Eugénie.
“I am to remain minister, then?” said Mazarin.
“And we say, ‘Proud as a Gascon,’” replied D’Artagnan.
I am only a lieutenant of musketeers, very poor, and journeys cost money.
Athos was for a few moments thoughtful.
“Of course, you know you can do so.
The dead, once buried in their graves, rise no more.”
But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she would, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow.
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “that is what you meant to say!”
One day when I cursed Providence for making me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father said to me, ‘Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your father, not yours,—of your father, who consigned you to hell if you died, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.’ After that I ceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father.
Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.
“Laugh if you please—I really think so.
“Wretch!” said he to the young man, who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and self-possession which never after abandoned him, “wretch!
“This dangerous man’s name was——”
“That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugénie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not love, my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed.”
“Barrois,” cried Valentine, “Barrois!”
“Yes, who was hanged.”
A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room.
Has he a lady with him?”
“See what is going on, Monsieur D’Artagnan,” said he.
“So much the better.
“And you—what are you doing here?” replied D’Artagnan.
“Maximilian, Maximilian,” he said, “the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian.”
“My faith!
The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was left solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table.
“Nor do I wish to be there,” replied the young man, rising.
You need not awaken the coachman; Ali will drive.”
Happily, D’Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.
It remains now for us to keep our word.
“And you think she would be angry?”
Good-day, commander!”
I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence.
“It is very fortunate,” said D’Artagnan to himself.
Mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach.
One day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal.
“I can see nothing inconvenient in that,” said the cardinal.
The bills were renewed, the old ones destroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources.
They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left Bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.
There you must find the curate, or if he is not at home, go to the convent of the Augustines, which is the last house on the right, and bring me one of the brothers.
“Dear friend,” said Porthos, “you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to-day than you were yesterday.
As to the soldier, he only smiled.
“Are you satisfied, my lord?” he asked.
Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a statue.
“That reminds me,” he said, “that when you entered I was on the point of signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you allow me to do the same to the others?”
“Because these prisoners, sir, are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I like.”
“It is not that which deterred me,” replied Monte Cristo; “but as I determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre, and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.”
THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS
“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will show you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on the borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.
“Well now,” he said, “it seems, my dear friend, that something vexes you; you are ill, perhaps?
“At midnight, my dear Monsieur Louvieres.”
Are you satisfied, sir?”
“In my wife’s chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his wounds.”
“Go on with your affair, monsieur,” cried Planchet; “I have finished mine.”
As for me, I have almost forgotten the little Latin I have ever known.
“As easily found as the cart.”
But mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every spectator.”
At two o’clock I shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tréville.
oh!” cried Porthos, “do you think so?”
Chapter XVI.
It was the abode of the little Abbé Scarron.
“Let it come,” said Athos.
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out a paper, and held it toward Athos.
You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you?”
If I am not mistaken those are citizens, helmeted and mailed, armed with good muskets, as in the time of the League, and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much; and now come to the other side—what do you see?
Grimaud extended his arm, and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a ferry.
“You are in a hurry?” said the Musketeer, as pale as a sheet.
Oh, you know it, tell them, tell them!” And the young man’s voice was choked by sobs.
“Yes, the enemy.
“I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,” said Albert, drawing Franz away, and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with Debray.
“For Albert is brave,” resumed Morrel.
“It is a magnificent charity.” Having said this, the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies.
“Yes.”
On perceiving the count he rose quickly.
“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care nothing for my title.
This was granted.
No, no, my boy; I prefer remaining honorably in the capital.”
“The former executioner of Bethune, who has just been brought in here, assassinated by Spaniards, and who is now being confessed by an Augustine friar.”
Dantès easily recognized them, Faria had so often drawn them for him.
“Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen, Bartoloni, and Canova?—all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I think but very indifferently of our French sculptors.”
“There,” said D’Artagnan, “this is capital!
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.

As to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner, who was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.
“This miserable strain confines me to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions.

I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”
She sighed again and leaned her charming head, gracefully reclined, on her hand, still beautiful in form and color.
“Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits—one on me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,” he added carelessly, “he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance of 100,000 francs.”
In one hand she held her handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping her face, and in the other a bottle of English smelling-salts.
“Sir,” said Villefort, “upon my word, you overcome me.
the point aimed at by every poniard!
“_Ventrebleu!_” cried D’Artagnan, rising from the table, the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one.
“What can I do for the son?
“If you could see my heart,” said D’Artagnan, “you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity.
As to Porthos, all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table.
That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived since the death of your wife.
“What?” asked D’Artagnan, seeing that Mme.
There was something mournful, solemn, and terrible in the count’s manner.
“Sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses.
Chapter LXIV.
Valentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.
I am an officer of fortune, nothing else; I have nothing but what my sword brings me in—that is to say, more blows than banknotes.
Meanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the letter.
“And if he doesn’t go straight I will crush him, that’s all.”
The Duchess de Longueville has invited me to pass a few days in Normandy, and has deputed me, while her son is being baptized, to go and prepare her residence at Rouen; after which, if nothing new occurs, I shall go and bury myself in my convent at Noisy-le-Sec.”
“No,” said Aramis, “they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipghauts.”
“And cooks?”
“Your mission is not accomplished?” exclaimed D’Artagnan, looking in astonishment at Athos.
“Now, my lord,” said the poor man, “let me have the poire d’angoisse.
He turned around, recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to them.
Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.
“How!
At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the little clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen.
Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès; but Dantès, who had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time than three months.
yes, I know that,” said D’Artagnan, “and you mentioned it to me; but who knows what has become of him?
Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen?
“Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?”
“Certainly not!” returned Danglars.
“Oh, it is a proof that the Lord is on our side, Felton,” replied Milady.
“To a convent?” said the duke.
“My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source; therefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own idea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me 4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less than 24,000 livres of our money—a sum at which, most assuredly, I should never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,” added Albert with a laugh, “that no prophet is honored in his own country.”
“Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been, up to the present, fruitless.
It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as journalists’ offices have always been from time immemorial.
“One minute,” said the young man.
They are two hotheads—the one a Gascon, the other from Picardy; both are easily excited, but they quiet down immediately.
The Baron d’Épinay was my friend, as you know, and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged.”
“You are sure of it?”
We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be glad to pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have given have been executed.”
“No,” said she, “I do not remember it just at this moment; but if it should occur to me presently, I will tell you.”
What end would that answer?
At the other end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay the corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard.
“Have you shown this letter to anyone?” asked Villefort, becoming still more pale.
Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.
“Never.”
“And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?” said Monte Cristo.
“I’ve a great desire to drink the king’s health,” said Athos.

“Therefore, sire, your Majesty sees that they are come, quite contrite and repentant, to offer you their excuses.”
Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of _giving_ myself; at present I shall appear to sell myself.”
Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell.
Caderousse shrugged his shoulders.
“Often!” said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving that falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end.
“Yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that.”
Therefore D’Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of M. de Tréville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure, when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of twenty Musketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.
The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of age, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like his beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.
“What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing to accede?”
Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered.
The young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle Valentine’s room, and the servant who had replaced Barrois, ran in at the same moment.
This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution.
Everything is clear to me now.
At length the shutter closed.
For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife, with two servants,—a chambermaid named Trinette, and a hostler called Pecaud.
“He is awake, so keep on the watch, as they are gone away; it’s for some purpose, rely on it.
and it was no bad one I believe, since here we are!”
So you hate each other?” said the count.
It bleeds, seemingly.”
In fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen’s apartment appeared the pretty Mme.
“Oh, no,” said Kitty, “it is not me you love!
“But the Comte de la Fere?” asked the king.
“It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the authorities.”
Accordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey.
“How, madame!” said the valet, “in the same carriage as your majesties?”
“Very well,” said Mazarin, “if I place you in security, in a manner evident, palpable——”
Let us see, for you know, my dear Captain, a judge must hear both sides.”
The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of Franz’s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged to know what had happened.
“Traitorous, monsieur.”
Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade.
“We have fallen in with a party of Spaniards.
Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes.
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground.
“Have you business there?”
You could not help thinking of it, and saying to yourself, ‘you, who pursue crime so vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?’” The baroness became pale.
Her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her father and mother, all would be lost.
“You see very plainly that there is still danger for you, since a single word makes you tremble; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined.
was going when he was assassinated.”
This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the antechamber, nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door.
“My dear sir,” he said, hastily, “do you know if the count is within?”
“My dear Athos,” cried Aramis, “I think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson—God forgive me!”
The conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game, yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him.
Comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du Trahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house.
“Go!—do you hear?” said Villefort, while d’Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out.
Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.”
“What?”
“In what branch?”
“That’s true!
“I should think not, indeed.
At these words, with the most gallant air possible, D’Artagnan drew his sword.
“And I give you absolution beforehand.
The host drew back and burst into tears.
As he could not leave his chamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission.”
For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them.
Chapter 31.
What is your opinion, gentlemen, and does not M. Mouston’s suggestion appear to you full of sense?”
“Good,” replied Aramis, calmly.
Do not seek to know how I discovered it; I know it—that is sufficient.
D’Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse, in order that he might see without being seen.
If you require to know positively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left shoulder.”
“You see it is yourself who have first named her—you, her father.”
“Does that alarm you?”
“He wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice.”
Well,” said Porthos, seated in the courtyard of the Hotel de la Chevrette, to D’Artagnan, who, with a long and melancholy face, had returned from the Palais Royal; “did he receive you ungraciously, my dear friend?”
“You have kissed the queen’s hand?” said M. de Tréville, looking earnestly at D’Artagnan.

“He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal.”
The Smugglers
“A stranger who will not send in his name!
“You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?”
“Listen,” said Monte Cristo; “I have had little to do with it, for I am at variance both with the father-in-law and the young man; there is only Mademoiselle Eugénie, who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony, and who, seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty, retains any affection for me.”
There is good and holy action to be performed, monsieur, and much money to be gained at the same time.”
Ten minutes after one is taken, the effect is produced.
“What do you require, then?”
“You are completely mistaken, sir,” said Monte Cristo coldly, who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing of his words; “you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who procured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious father, the pleasure of your acquaintance?—two of my good friends, Lord Wilmore and the Abbé Busoni.
Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub, but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested.
“Then no misfortune has happened to you?”
The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs.
Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary, addressing Athos, “declare all that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur.”
“Madame,” said Athos, “when must we set out?”
He glanced mechanically towards the piazza—the scene was wholly changed; scaffold, executioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained, full of noise and excitement.
Therefore Kitty surrendered.
“Delirium!” murmured the monk, shaking his head.
“No!”
“Did you go into these houses with her?”
This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome.
Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door.”
Elsewhere the count found everything he required—smelling-bottles, cigars, knick-knacks.
Mazarin made a bound from his chair, which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make.
“On the importance of the step you are taking.”
“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said Morrel, “but I do not see M. de Morcerf.”
Valentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent.
“No.”
I am a sailor.”
“It was thus, and by mere accident—may God pardon me if I blaspheme—that he heard the confession of the executioner of Bethune.”
a hundred pistoles!
Perhaps I shall stand in need of a back door for retreat.”
The footman was withdrawing, but Athos stopped him by a sign.
Some days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs-Élysées, which had already assumed that palace-like appearance which the count’s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences.
Beauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, “Sir,” said he, “I just now accompanied M. de Morcerf, as you saw.”
“The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germain.”
“Back, people!” cried D’Artagnan, “your leader is dead; you have no longer any business here.”
Day, for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes, again dawned.
However, as he was a favorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him.
But the voyage was not ended.
“Yes, my lord.”
“What, do you think he is paying his addresses?”
The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks.
It cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts.
I had no such contempt for men before.”
“No,” replied Villefort; “a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators.”
Then her brow darkened.
He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the cardinal.
She listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and glared horribly.
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg.
“And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel?”
“I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville, on some pretext or other which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts.
By Jove!
“Thus ’tis quite decided,” said D’Artagnan, “that what I have to offer to you does not tempt you?”
He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty’s command.
“Oh, my God!
“Then, my dear mother,” said Albert, putting his hand to the bell, “they must be taken into the antechamber.
“Athos!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.
Grimaud was walking before him with a lantern.
“For heaven’s sake, Beauchamp,” returned Morcerf, “do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere.
“I see!” said he, “there are two of them; one does the work while the other stands guard.” He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.
“I told you so, Athos,” said D’Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders.
His next care on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a cap.
“Here,” he said, “here is a draft at sight.”
Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the _Pharaon_ should be lost, and this last resource be gone——”
“Certainly not.”
We are about to leave this evening,” continued Mazarin.
The day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage.
Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure, the fine, noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure; he inhaled the tones of that young voice, as harmonious music.
In a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal, formerly styled the Palais Cardinal, a man was sitting in deep reverie, his head supported on his hands, leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers.
“At these words he retired.

That same night the general was to go over to the English.
“And what?”
This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my life.
He wished to see everything.
“Nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come.”
This last proof, instead of giving him fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to be assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint.
He had only two hours’ work to do to open communication with the king and, according to the calculations of the four friends, they had the entire day before them, since, the executioner being absent, another must be sent for to Bristol.
“Pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!”
“Shall we return to the camp?” said Porthos.
“Gentlemen,” continued the stranger, “since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself.
“Keep guard at the other door, Athos and Aramis.
“Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly?”
“I am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,” said Mme.
Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed beneath Persia’s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of Chandernagor.
Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort?”
“Yes,” said Morrel, “it is true; I have but now left a house where death has just entered, to run to you.”
“I did,” replied the count.
“Yes, yes, very sure!”
Order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed with garlic, and four bottles of old Burgundy.”
The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and flowers.
“Villainous host!” cried he, “he has given us Anjou wine instead of champagne, and fancies we know no better!
He then returned to Paris, and although in the same carriage with Château-Renaud and Albert, he did not hear one word of their conversation.
There now, shall we start?”
In the meantime, the ferryboat had floated away, carried down by the stream, and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more.
“Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?”
He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening.
“I say he is a myth,” replied Albert, “and never had an existence.”
Ah!
“Say not a word about being late,” replied the stranger in purest Tuscan; “’tis I who am too soon.
Try and find a seat—there is one by that geranium, which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.”
“Yes.”
“I go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme.
They had passed the Tête de Mort, were now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery.
Albert was on the point of pronouncing his father’s name, when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man recollected his promise, and was silent.
But it is a glorious day for me,’ continued the young girl, raising her ardent gaze to heaven, ‘that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father!’
I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and with the other five hundred I set off for Nîmes.
“No, my lord; be assured we shall not.”
“It is not grief, my dear Villefort,” said the doctor; “grief may kill, although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in ten minutes.” Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head, which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with amazement.
Chapter X. Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.
You would not fight a duel?” asked Albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.
Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be.
Not a modern picture among them.
“Which you refused?”
“My life has been passed on the high road.”
He remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès.
“Yes,” replied the procureur.
“Well, has anybody come out?”
As he descended the staircase, Morrel met Penelon, who was going up.
Porthos arrived a minute after D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan smiled.
I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder, down at Pierrefonds, and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples.”
“Bravo!” cried D’Artagnan, “you sing charmingly, dear Aramis.
Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count; for I imagine, just now, that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us.
“So you like it, you rogue?”
“Luigi was jealous!
When the gentleman who came three months ago—the agent of Thomson & French—arrives, announce his arrival to me.”

I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night.
Had we not better lower our heads?”
“But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship’s supercargo?”
“Well,” said he, when Franz had concluded, “what do you find to object to in all you have related?
“As to what you say about not seeing you again, I believe not a word of it; with such a heart as yours—and such a sword—one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times, unscathed and unalarmed.
Athos and Porthos dragged me into this to occupy me.
“Well, cheer up!” said a loud voice from the staircase, which Porthos had just mounted.
I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.” The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.
Let the queen remain in perfect security; let her be ignorant that we know her secret.
“The steward of the Duc de Grammont.”
Danglars then opened the window.
Once out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man, he asked:
“Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was obliged to give a mother to my child.”
pronounced the famous, “I have been almost obliged to wait.” Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse voice:
It is a demand that Porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at present.”
“I am not calumniating you, my friend.
“Thanks, thanks,” said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward’s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it.
“How, sir!” said Planchet, “is it you?”
“Waiter,” said Danglars, “pen, ink, and paper.”
The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we know how to wait.”
“Don’t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman.
“Does the letter contain anything valuable?” demanded the host, after a few minutes of useless investigation.
Beauchamp was thunderstruck.
“Good God!
I know not why, but I feel that this crime——”

D’Artagnan smiled.

Accept this half-pistole to drink to my health.”
“You are a jewel of a man, Mr. O’Reilly; but that is not all.
“Nor I,” said Aramis.
“He was there.”
The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him.
When the procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation.
“You may go.”
He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen, as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms, the beautiful Madame de Longueville.
La Ramee carried off all his clothes, in order to be certain that the duke would not stir.
This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.
The file on the Corso broke the line, and in a second all the carriages had disappeared.
Both Orleans and Montargis are ours.
“Ah!
“I wish,” continued Mazarin, finishing, as it were, the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut; “I wish, in fact, that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover.”
It was, however, too late; Albert had followed the footman, and, hearing the order given, forced the door open, and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the banker’s study.
I was about to give it when you anticipated me.”
“How is that?”
“Oh, your excellency!” returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.
“Drink it,” said the doctor to Barrois.
“He has done us the honor to remain here.”
“She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.”
“Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made?”
The young man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute.
“Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,” replied Monte Cristo.
“But you speak of him, not of his party, his resources.”
This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about twenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face.
Monte Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.
In order that there might be no confusion, Franz wore his peasant’s costume.
“Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!”
“Yes, your majesty, there is a title which I covet much,” replied Scarron.
So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de Justice.
“And what may it be?”

The two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and D’Artagnan, and advanced toward the door.
has he not come?” said Kitty.
But there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say was, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”
“Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now,” said Monte Cristo, “I must believe on seeing you.”
“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted, and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this Luigi Vampa.

“By her step she must be young; perhaps she is pretty.
The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience.
Chapter LXII.
Ah!
“I shall go,” he said, “to the queen.”
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre, the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, D’Artagnan, without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.
The man retired, but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the king.
“As soon as the enemy are within musket shot, we must fire upon them.
Give us the clergy and the people, of whom you can dispose, and I will bring you the citizens and the parliament; with these four elements Paris is ours in a week; and believe me, monsieur coadjutor, the court will give from fear what it will not give from good-will.”
“Well,” said Aramis, when they were alone, “what do you think of this business, my dear count?”
“You really have some distrust, then?” said Porthos.
There was a stream close by and a bridge across it.
She sat down, took Edward on her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her affections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom.
“To Athos, to a man double his age?” interrupted Tréville.
“We were almost agreed on those,” replied Mazarin; “let us pass on to private and personal stipulations.”
Come; reflect, and decide.”

“If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place, what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have really done.”
Besides, the woman wore that black mantle which D’Artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a Musketeer.
“I always said that D’Artagnan had the longest head of the four,” said Athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which D’Artagnan replied with a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.
These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart.
“Shall we obey?” asked Blaisois.
“Yes; but all four together and without a scratch; which is a consolation.”
At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed.
“It was about one of those purchases that interest women—a purchase by which much might have been gained.”
“Thanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must, in your turn, satisfy me of yours.
“You are right,” exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, “I will write today.”
B., Constance Bonacieux.”
I could only utter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came over me.
Will you take charge of our invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?”
“Monseigneur,” replied Porthos, “he has gone as a scout, on account of some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.”

“Sacrebleu!
Apropos, when do you aspect M. d’Épinay?”
One of the windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung, split in two, on its hinges.
“And of what are you so sure?”
To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses.
“The woman of the garden!—she that was _enceinte_—she who was walking while she waited for——”
“Wait a moment—no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego, Vicomte de Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends.
“By me?
“I agree to it, too,” said Porthos, “if D’Artagnan approves of it.
“Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel, in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu, tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood, to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to Buckingham.”
“Good,” thought D’Artagnan; “we must look about us; he’s going to play us a trick.”
Ten minutes elapsed, during which D’Artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second.
“Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain.”
D’Artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions.
At about half-past eight o’clock they reached the first houses in Noisy; every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village.
Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream?
“Yes,” said Valentine, “I will now acknowledge you are right, Maximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?” said the young girl sorrowfully.
“I will run for it, sir;” and the guide went out.
Rapid as had been Villefort’s glance, it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate.
D’Artagnan bowed.
A flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of Milady.
“You will hear me to the end, my Lord.
Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate—there was no alternative.
“The fish bites—the fish bites!” whispered the Gascon to Porthos.
Monsieur de Richelieu would have said, ‘Five hundred crowns for the councillor.’ Well, let’s say no more about it.
Chapter 35.
D’Artagnan added M. de Tréville to the others, as may be perceived; but he thought this addition would do no harm.
He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed.
I confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity.
God is wearied; he has punished you.”
“But, Monsieur Commissary,” said he, calmly, “believe that I know and appreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed.”
And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debray.
There happened then that which you know, and of which your precipitate departure,” added the host, with an acuteness that did not escape D’Artagnan, “appeared to authorize the issue.
Porthos came up behind, and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room.
“Take this letter,” said D’Artagnan.
They opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip.
This being understood, let us proceed with our history.
These proceedings made D’Artagnan and Porthos draw back.
Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path, which, at the distance of a hundred paces, led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley.
Villefort whispered some words in his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.
The tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes, watering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the furniture.
The game at tennis, which, upon a sign from Grimaud, Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play, began in the afternoon.
He looked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans had disappeared.
“The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin—some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently.”
He urged the horse again into a trot.
An hour of terror elapsed, for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back.
“A child’s reason—I repeat it,” continued Mousqueton.
“What is it?” asked the count, impatiently.
“You will permit me to make one remark?”
The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.
“If Mousqueton were with us,” observed Athos, on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers, “how he would tremble at passing this!
“Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear; but as I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer, and instead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me, while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.
“My daughter,” continued the banker, “you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.”

I tell you that you were wrong.”
“What is going on?” asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.

“No, Athos, no, you are mistaken,” said D’Artagnan; “I love my poor Constance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were it at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of her enemies; but I am ignorant.

Danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee.
But, by degrees, watch-chains, necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests, elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the shoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.

It was, indeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon.
“What is that again?” he asked.

“Is he at liberty?” asked the queen.
“There is, then, one,” said Monte Cristo, “whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars?”

You have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an eel; if I had missed you tonight, I might not have had another chance.”
I ask your excellencies’ pardon, but this is quite a French demand; for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button.”

More than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she would not have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de Château-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian extraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de Saint-Méran despised all who were not noble.
“That purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?”
“At all events,” said Milady, seriously, “he has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.”
The snow was falling thick and icy.
“Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the hall,” said Beauchamp.
Morrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket, beautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four bending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven.

As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than usual, for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Café de Paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in the hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of their duty, which was thus naturally interrupted.

They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his thoughts.
“No; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance—in your own country, for instance.”
So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by D’Artagnan’s inventive imagination.
“Listen, my friends,” said the count—“I may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years—the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.
If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.”
“Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.”
“Infamous task!
He found D’Artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante-room.
“Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events.”
The astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it was announced to them that the city, which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil, had awakened to such feverish commotion; nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them, declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears.
In which we hear Tidings of Aramis.
you scoundrel!” cried D’Artagnan, taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword.
“That’s lucky,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.
“God’s blood!” cried the officer, “have they killed him?
“What a strange man you are!
And where will your worship drink?”
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.
His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea.
“In order to see the queen,” said Aramis, “we must first see the cardinal; and when we have seen the cardinal—remember what I tell you, Athos—we shall be reunited to our friends, but not in the way you wish.
“Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf on account of loving another?”
But what did you do yesterday after you left me?”
“You see,” said she, when the lackey had gone out, “everything is ready.
Fortunately, you have the sapphire.”

“We must proceed in an orderly manner.”
D’Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity.
But then he may have stopped at Saint Germain.”
The lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels.
Because you think I am drunk?
You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.”
“But you say you do not wish to kill me?”
“And you have been here since——”
“It is enough to have killed the mother,” said Athos, hoarsely.
“Why, about ten or eleven o’clock.”
“You are right, sir,” said Athos.
Speak on.”
“I will come at once to the point.
Holloa, Patrick!”
That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in Paris.
“My lord,” said Raoul, coloring up, “I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count.
“Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much.
“Do then as I did, my lord.
“Things look black enough,” replied Porthos; “I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt.”
M. de Tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the hand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.
Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,—he had had a great many Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.
“Halloo!
“Why?”
“Oh!
“It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!” cried the young girl.
“Really, sir,” retorted the count, “have you attained the eminent situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without having met with exceptions?
“_Au revoir_, Monsieur Bonacieux, _au revoir!_”
“Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the Academy.”
Hastily raising myself on one arm, I looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.
And besides, if it is not the prince, then Monsieur de Gondy——”
But to her great surprise D’Artagnan remained perfectly calm, and instead of being angry he laughed, and said to Porthos:
but surely you are Monsieur d’Artagnan?”
“If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?” said Kitty, timidly.
The moaning of waves, the noise of thunder, the roaring of a volcano, cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment.
The inspector turned smilingly to the governor.
Or, s’blood, my brave Athos will die!”
“A Tuscan count.”
“Oh, my legs, my poor legs!
At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir, Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features contracted, and her eyes glaring horribly.
D’Artagnan’s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract.
On arriving at the extremity of the castle D’Artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley, in which, at the foot of a charming little lake, stood several scattered houses, which, humble in their aspect, and covered, some with tiles, others with thatch, seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau, built about the beginning of the reign of Henry IV., and surmounted by four stately, gilded weather-cocks.
I will lay a wager that ’twas that Saint Christopher, Porthos, who performed this feat!
“And the drawers?”
“Now,” said Aramis, “we know how the matter stands.
At that moment the countenance of Mme.
“You are pale and agitated.”
“The food is the same as in other prisons,—that is, very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance.”
The Return.
You have no longer a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard.
“I dare say you have nothing else with you.
Let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!”
...content with making me pay for my hat,
“That comforts me a little.”
At four o’clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables.
“Gentlemen,” cried Chatillon, “the truce is broken, that is evident; they are going to fight; go, then, into Charenton, for I shall begin in a short time—there’s a signal from the prince!”
“Bazin beadle at Notre Dame!
In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman, dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate, riding on a tall horse.
Julie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel.
This policy of Louis XIII.
“Go on, go on, my dear fellow!” said D’Artagnan; “for upon my honor, you will kill me with your indifference.”
Every career is open to you.
Noirtier, playing with revolutions—M.
Chapter XXIII.
“You gave De Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did you not?”
“No false generosity, count!
The Judge Chapter 109.
“Some Provençal, it appears.
He tore his hair.
“The woman was English, then?”
“Why?”
“The longboat is yonder, lashed to the felucca.
“‘Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which the court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural, considering your birth and your misfortunes?’—‘Sir,’ replied Haydée, ‘I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief.
“Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human means.
“No, she was French, but she had married in England.”
In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.
Bonacieux, throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands.
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of which the last in France, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn by King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet.
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de Chantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme.
“Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.”
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.
“I see,” said Mazarin, “that everybody kneels before him, although he be but coadjutor, whilst I, were I in his place, though I am cardinal, should be torn to pieces.
Grimaud begins his Functions.
I see!
The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Méran family.
Go!”
“Marie Michon,” continued Athos.
I shall seek, not Mazarin, but the queen, and say to her, ‘Madame, restore to us your two servants and our two friends.’”
But D’Artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses.
“I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to me, ‘Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?’ I reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then I replied, ‘Listen,—I have always heard of Providence, and yet I have never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make me believe that he exists.
“A whole bottle?
“No, but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud.”
“We are here;—take courage.”
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,—now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.”
When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz, the pupil of M. Noirtier’s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his son.
I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention, then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me.
It is true we plundered them a little when we took them, and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play.
But one word more, count.”
“Come, now,” he said.
“No, not yet.”
“I never meddle save with what concerns me, and I know how to make believe that I haven’t seen what does not concern me; but I hate hypocrites, and among that number I place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers; and,” he added, turning to Porthos “here’s a gentleman who’s of the same opinion as myself.”
Meantime, D’Artagnan, who is full of invention, would find some way to save the king.
He rose, however, as they approached.
He rejoined this woman; they fled together into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy.
“But fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men, and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to which you cry, ‘Fie!
The pretty Madeleine, who had approached during this colloquy, stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos’s words, for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated.
“Well, then, did he ask you, ‘Who is M. Albert de Morcerf?
This second attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony.
“Not that way, if you please.”
“God’s justice!
“As for me,” said Planchet, “I seem to smell, from this place, even, a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat, and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge, hailing our approach.
“Yes, indeed, the marks are recent.”
It was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him.
“Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject.
“Good God!” cried the hollow voice of Athos, “I can hear D’Artagnan, I think.”
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two other soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.
Do you mean is he a good comrade?
“As usual.
And is the reason known?”
The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing.”
“A truce to compliments,” said Aramis; “we want to see the coadjutor, and instantly, as we are in haste.”
“Well, I must confess it does,” replied D’Artagnan.
Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia.
Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures.
Decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal.
“And why separate?” asked Athos.
“I?
“Well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss.
Chapter 21.
“There’s only one remedy, dear Raoul—that is, to marry her as a compensation.” remarked D’Artagnan.
“I believe, by Heaven,” said D’Artagnan, “that I shall embrace him, since he’s upon our road; and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear Athos, from that very day he becomes my son.”
“Truly, Athos,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of.
‘The third of my friends, although my rival, was much attached to me,—his name was Fernand; that of my betrothed was’—Stay, stay,” continued the abbé, “I have forgotten what he called her.”
I offered to pay them for cancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs.
“Ah, that’s quite another thing; but promise me, if you should not be killed tonight, that you will go tomorrow.”
My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.”
His heart ceased beating, he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table.
“And you should call it ‘Devotion,’” added Aramis; “the vineyard of self-sacrifice, to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master.”
no accident has happened to him?”
“Madame, he is very happy in owing any obligation to you.”
“Sir,” said he to Danglars, “understand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo.”
“Ah,” said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.
A short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure.
“Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the Chevalier d’Artagnan, lieutenant in the musketeers?”
Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes;’
At this instant M. de Tréville entered, cool, polite, and in irreproachable costume.
He sighed, and whispered a name, and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair—a head like that of a Magdalen by Correggio—was raised and turned towards him.
“Well,” said the count, turning towards Franz, “I told you there was some mistake in this.”
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior.
“Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!” said Julie.
The soldier replied that he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him.
When left alone with Bernouin, Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought.
“You know it is not my fault,” said Morrel.
It was very hard.”
Duty before everything.
“Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to what I allude, Danglars—it is sacred.
“Wherever they are, that’s my business.”
Besides, you know, I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to France.
“Ah, you are awake, madame,” he said; “then I have nothing more to do here.
“But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have constantly denied having rendered you this service?”
“Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?
“Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have used, that it is not irreparable.”
“I asked to be excused in case I should not be able to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the right to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill, Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis.
Then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother and I were drinking.”
“How much do you suppose he possesses?”
The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation, stood up with his arms crossed.
“I swear,” he said, with a calm brow and kindly glance, but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion, “I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends.
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS
“The Viscount de Bragelonne?
“A louis on account for a fowl?”
“Here,” said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,—“here is the spot where my father stopped, when the _Pharaon_ entered the port; it was here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and dishonor, threw himself into my arms.
The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse, not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen’s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure.
“I want to see it.
“What?”
“Was it Ali,” asked the Count of Morcerf, “who rescued my son from the hands of bandits?”
The youths spurred on.
He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted M. de Tréville.
From his past life, from his resolution to shrink from nothing, the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged, sometimes against nature, that is to say, against God, and sometimes against the world, that is, against the devil.
The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket.
“If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history,” said Milady, “perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the future.”
“With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised.
But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence, and a habit of fifteen or twenty years’ duration becomes second nature.
Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Léopold Robert or Schnetz.
For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures, I show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again—a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with Mercédès, my betrothed!”
You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest.” Albert rose and took his hat; the count conducted him to the door.
“I do.”
Instantly afterwards four carbineers, on horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck.
yes—I should expect so; besides, if they forget, I shall take the liberty of reminding them.”
“Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State.”
“Where is Morrel?” he asked; “do either of these gentlemen know where he is?”
Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.”
D’Artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat.
“How!” said Bonacieux, astonished.
“What do you say?”
“Have you the keys?”
“Good!” answered Porthos.
“Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands?”
“And you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.”
At Herlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more, for he exclaimed eagerly:
“He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island of Elba.
Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing Milady.
“Sire, I entreat you to do so.”
“Let them say what they will; besides, how will they know that we are doing it?”
“Well, I shall look upon it as an expiation.”
“Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?”
A silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource, he knocked again.
D’Artagnan, taking with him three trusses of straw, returned to the chateau, where everybody, freezing with cold and more than half asleep, envied the king, the queen, and the Duke of Orleans, on their camp beds.
At this instant the squadron, that ought to have protected Charles’s retreat, was advancing to meet the English regiments.
M. de Tréville was surprised to the greatest degree.
“Yes, he is making recruits and he will lend them to me; if any are missing when the fete is over, I shall replace them.”
When quite a child, the little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity.
“The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina?”
Bonacieux inferred from this “Ah” that the affair grew more and more intricate.
Grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert.
Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress—a jacket and breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with buckles, and a silk waistcoat.
“Remove the mutton,” cried Comminges; “I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well, more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his appetite.”
“Look out!” cried D’Artagnan, “I see black points and red points moving yonder.
The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words.
“Egad!” cried D’Artagnan, “it’s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here.”
“I do not enter the Church; I re-enter it.
“Monsieur de Tréville awaits Monsieur d’Artagnan,” cried a servant, throwing open the door of the cabinet.
“Child,” replied the count, “not to know the value of a man’s word!
“I live there during my leave of absence,” continued Maximilian; “and I shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.”
The two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand-daughter of Henry IV., the wife and daughter of Charles I.
The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day; the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest.
“Tell me; satisfy my impatience.”
“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts.”
“Because, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I ask it.”
I want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when I shall have learned what I desire to know, I will withdraw.”
“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”
Villefort walked to and fro behind them.
The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided in his favor.

“God has so willed it!” said he, with the resignation of a fanatic; but without, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life.
The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms.
Salute my hero, viscount.”
Carriages now arrived in crowds; those of the Marechal de Villeroy, Guitant, Villequier and Comminges came into the line.
Then, certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her horse and disappeared.
my young man,” said D’Artagnan, drawing his sword, “that is an order sooner given than executed.
DEAR M. D’ARTAGNAN, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends, particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time.
“You will breakfast with me, will you not, Morrel?” said the count, to turn the conversation.
“But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,” said Château-Renaud.
“And whose are they?”
He must have written to him.
It was you who rode off at the moment I had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of.”
This idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the captain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his false position—placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat between the mice and the birds—was in great haste to regain England, and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman’s caprice, promising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him, at one of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest.
“Port,” he said, extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by D’Artagnan and himself.
“Tell me of those men,” said the abbé, “and remember too,” he added in an almost menacing tone, “you have promised to tell me everything.
“It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,” said Athos.
“You are free, my brothers!
The marshal raised his hand in token of assent.
“He has agents, then, throughout the world?” cried D’Artagnan.
“And since—I do not give it,” said the musketeer.
Dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.
There is a third, and the most terrible—that is my condition as a mortal being.
“And you would arrest him?”
The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier, wrapped in a brown cloak, with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes.
The lower rooms were entirely filled with Kourchid’s troops; that is to say, with our enemies.
“You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; ‘man proposes, and God disposes.’” Andrea sighed.
Every one hoped so, so that the minister felt that all around him, beneath the homage of the courtiers, lay a fund of hatred, ill disguised by fear and interest.
Mademoiselle Eugénie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the Countess G——, and where Morcerf had just made his appearance.
“Well?”
The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage, and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.
“Well, then, to the king, your nephew.
“By all means,” replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to open the door.
“But this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.”
“M.
When D’Artagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five o’clock, it presented, in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town, a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing.
Anne arose, full of majesty, and as if touched by a spring, and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful: “You are insulting me!” she said.
“Ingrate that you are!”
“My dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified.
The blood mounted to his temples, his eyes became dim; he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose, and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword.
“Another attack of giddiness,” said Morrel, clasping his hands.
Felton and he addressed Patrick, the duke’s confidential lackey, at the same moment.
However difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to astonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him.
Now guess what the young one did?”
“But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards.
“Attention, Porthos!” cried D’Artagnan.
“My grief will kill me of itself.”
The whole intrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in this letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of you.”
When they met they looked desolately at one another, as much as to say, “Have you found anything?”
“The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed the Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno.
“Listen,” said M. de Tréville; “shall I give you counsel, good counsel, the counsel of a friend?”
Three or four times he has said to me, and certainly without the slightest premeditation, ‘at such a period I was five years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,’ and I, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate.
That would carry you to the end of the world.
“It would frighten you too much.”
He approached the other door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, “Madame, will you permit me to offer you my services?
He came down into the kitchen, where your doublet was.
We will explain in a few words how D’Artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence.
“Meanwhile,” said Felton, “convey me to the little bay of—; you know it was agreed you should put in there.”
“At me?”
He therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass.
You have befouled the face of your king.
Tell me, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and the father with famine?”
“Was I a major?” timidly asked the old soldier.
“And he who says in ‘projection,’ means already decided,” said Debray.
“Well, then,” said Felton, “I will tell you what you were doing, or rather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind.
At this moment Raoul awoke, without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude; his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress, for his glance, in return, had all the tenderness of love.
“Because he left no Commentaries,” replied La Ramee, with his coarse laugh.
“Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort?
You will have sufficient time before five o’clock; despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station.
“Go, leave me; I would be alone.
“No doubt,” said Aramis, “but it is far from here to the enemy.”
All the day, all the next night passed away without my seeing him again.
“How do I know it?” said D’Artagnan.
These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic Isles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis.
“Molière or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself, I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you understand.”
Felton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door.
A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.
“It is well,” returned the voice; “tomorrow.”
Whilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and Grimaud, the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were entering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel.
You understand!”
“A letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was given to me for you.”
“Yes, sir.
But all the Italians are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in Oriental splendor.”
“I thought, perhaps,” said Danglars with supreme impertinence, “that you had a deficiency to make up?”
Raoul had only been at M. Scarron’s house; he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there.
At this appeal D’Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the chamber.
D’Artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred; the dogs became in their turn silent.
All around him were lying the Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies, while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows.
The two lower rooms consisted of a dining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a wainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece.
“Reflect, Morcerf, one moment before you go.”
D’Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion.
“You can restore it to his family,” said D’Artagnan.
Then the vessel resumed its course, still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by side with it, menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon.
The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened.
“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics.”
I am weeping with joy.”
There, after a few days, if you like, the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony.
The Breakfast
“Is it possible?”
“’Tis then the devil that pursues!” he cried; drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe.
“It has been made up a long time,” said Gondy.
“That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.”
With 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.”
He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.
“I had been told, but would not credit it, that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali Pasha.”
“Oh, my God!” muttered Athos.
Here is the prisoner; let us attend to what is most pressing.”
“We understand each other perfectly, then.
At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, D’Artagnan’s horse gave out, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose.
“Meanwhile, let us dine,” suggested Porthos.
“Ah, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for that fault, unhappy wretch as I am!”
“Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris?
What the devil are you doing there?” cried the two friends.
Don’t question me, I beg of you, but lend me a horse.”
“Ah, true,” observed Monte Cristo; “I recollect now.
You have a friend, Monsieur du Vallon, whom I like much; let him accompany you.”
No, we shall beat them by merely temporizing.
really, Villefort, you surprise me.
But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?”
Mercédès is not yet your wife.
“Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up?”
“By a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal’s police.”
Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.
“‘There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it.
He found Athos and Aramis philosophizing.
“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena.
“And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”
“These gentlemen are with me,” said Winter.
“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”
You have done for me, as you promised, all that you could do.
His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and winter, he took possession of his apartment about four o’clock, though he never spent the night there.
When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.
From their dress, covered with dust, and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable, the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders.
Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night.
“No, I do not hesitate; God forbid!
‘Approach then,’ said the messenger, ‘or I will come nearer to you, if you prefer it.’—‘I will agree to neither one nor the other,’ replied the young soldier; ‘place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there, and retire while I examine it.’—‘Be it so,’ said the envoy; and he retired, after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim.
“What do you say?”
“No.”
It was a continual scratching, as if made by a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the stones.
“Yes, doctor,” cried Villefort, clutching his hair, “yes!”
The leader closed the window, came out an instant after by the door, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage.
“You do not understand me, Maximilian.
“What wounded man?”
“And what is it saying—anything you understand?”
Bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled.
Bonacieux was standing at the door, and looked at D’Artagnan hatefully.
“Yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?”
Then an idea crossed my mind, which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two feet long, and six or eight inches deep.
“But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?”
A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style.
Bonacieux, and that he should find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and carried her off.
“The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill——”
“‘Who was your brother?’ asked he.
The young girl hastily took the letter from him.
“Everything that your eminence may please to command me,” was the reply.
And now eat and drink; I will entertain you tonight.
“It is more—it is magnificent.”
Three days since you were with him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend.”
“Saturday.”
“Besides,” continued he, in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking—“besides, who says that it will begin again?”
“Oh, I don’t doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan; “but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms—a certain embroidered handkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your acquaintance?”
Tell me, now, can you deny all this?”
“No?” said the notary; “then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de Villefort?”
Don’t you think so, D’Artagnan?”
At the same moment, whilst D’Artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen, a metallic sound, as if some one was moving a bag of gold, struck on his ear; he started; instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase.
As for Raoul, he remained bewildered with what he had seen, having been forbidden by D’Artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over.
“But I,” said D’Artagnan, “can go and inform Monsieur Laporte.”
“But now you are happy?”
All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock.
But as this dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens me.

The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him.
“Silence,” said the abbé; “you will force the last drop of blood from your veins.
Grimaud made a sign that he was not.
Really, count, if ever I thought that I had a friend in the ranks of the royal army, it was you.
“It is well; I will go.”
Go to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-Élysées, on the 26th of May, at seven o’clock in the evening, and demand of him your father.
Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as, in later times, Frederick of Prussia used to be.
“Come, Monsieur Bazin, make yourself easy,” said D’Artagnan; “people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven.”
For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love.
Come, Guitant, come along, and let’s see if they keep watch at the Quinze-Vingts as at the Barriere des Sergens.”
D’Artagnan did not smile.
“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your grandfather says he can indicate the person.
“In that case,” replied Franz, “as I shall raise none, you may make arrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it.”
“Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar?” said Mordaunt, with a terrible smile; “no, it is Charles the First, the king, the good King Charles, who despoils his subjects to enrich himself.”
“The precaution of changing our clothes.”
It is urgent that I should have this money without delay.
He turned towards Porthos and Aramis.
“Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed.
“And the queen, at what time is it her wish to start?”
The door had been opened, and shut again; the mercer’s pretty wife had disappeared.
“I?
“And now,” said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the duke’s tone toward her—“now that I have received the instructions of your Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine?”
He was attired as he had been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu.
She for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.
She returned to Louise, took up the portmanteau, which she had placed for a moment on the ground, and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall.
“What matters it to you, Kitty?
He came languidly, placing himself in a good situation to see all the details.
“To beg him to assist me in finding my wife.
She took it, and looked attentively on the count; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration.
And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel, situated near the Marais, for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale, Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling.
Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their conversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an army, or governor of a province.
“That is extremely kind of you,” said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference.
Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips.
“Do you repent?” asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars’ hair to stand on end.
“Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension.
The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father’s death.
“Why, in this way: if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him, on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape, ’tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape.”
He wished to confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus, he should put a gag in his mouth.
Athos wished to restrain him, but it was too late.
“What!” demanded D’Artagnan.
They arrived at Amiens at midnight, and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden Lily.
“Count de Guiche,” said the prince, “it is a long time since you saw your father, remain here with him.
“But the night is dark,” said Athos, perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear; “and you have no servant.”
“Till we meet again, then, dear traitor!”
“In a month you will find on the table, at which we shall be then sitting, good pistols and a delicious draught; but, on the other hand, you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time.”
“Ah, mercy—mercy!” cried Caderousse.
The first door, barricaded with furniture, had aroused in him certain suspicions, but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion.
Six of his Eminence’s Guards arrest six of his Majesty’s Musketeers!
You are acquainted with the Scriptures?”
“Oh, meddle in nothing which concerns me.
“Speak, and I will follow your advice.”
This, as you know, is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Cavalier.”
In exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known, protected badly—as witness Chalais and Mme.
“If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any more to eat.”
One seemed, as he raised the wine to his lips, to hear him say, ‘Come, juice of the grape, and chase away my sorrows.’ And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle!
I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper.”
Well, it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears to you flat and distasteful.
“Is the baroness at home?” inquired Danglars.
“I am in possession of all my senses, sir,” he said; “my body alone suffers, as you may suppose.
He was armed at all points.
“Poor dear girl!
“One only.”
“‘Leave me, I command you.’
I will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example.
That is forbidden, it seems to me.”
M. Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities.
“I will return home instantly.”
The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated between Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce.
“He is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed you in his apartment.”
Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.
You must have received a false report, or you have gone mad.”
Peppino nodded, and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone out.
“And now, Raoul,” said he, “you are launched; you have dukes for friends, a marshal of France for godfather, a prince of the blood as commander, and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens; it is not so bad for a novice.”
War had made her a queen; peace brought her abdication.
We must, therefore, watch and play a close game; for,” he added with a sigh, “we two are equal, perhaps, to eight others; but we are not equal to the four that you know of.”
“What does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?” asked the king in a severe tone.
“Perhaps there are four,” said D’Artagnan.
“Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that.
What can I do?
‘Is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead “Not guilty”?
The Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.
I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have thews of iron, a wrist of steel.
No country can say it saw my birth.
Monte Cristo looked at the room.
I have no fear of ghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day.
It is not very difficult to say.”
I looked carefully around; I was indeed alone,—no noise disturbed the silence but the owl, whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night.
“Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience.
But, on the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that Fernand Mondego, raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you had done me, in admitting me to your friendship, I hastened to you.”
The king saw the four gentlemen come in, but appeared to take no notice of them.
“Sir,” said Comminges, “declare yourself at once; will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king?”
“But how do you know all this?”
But what are you about there?
50273m
Day gilded the tops of the houses.
And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was there.
“Oh!
And, then, to be here so young!
Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal’s.
No one ever asked her where she was going.
“You have been preparing long enough, my lord, for it to be welcome to you now.”
“‘You?’ cried I.
During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.
In vain—were I an ambitious man—should I struggle against such remembrances as he has left; but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you.
Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another.
He glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic.
Chapter LXXXII.
Mazarin, who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry “Long live Mazarin,” and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each, kept one eye on Porthos; but that gigantic body-guard replied to the look with his great bass voice, “Be tranquil, my lord,” and Mazarin became more and more composed.
“And what can we do there?”
It is the people who do not obey that I punish, and not those who, like you, obey—but too well.
The aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of October.
“I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches.”
He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her solitude and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion.
Dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense.
“It is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,” said the notary.
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but Aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs.
“We do ourselves justice, madame, even in assuming the high position that we have.
The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin.
“What must then be done?”
“Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?” asked Villefort.
“The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal,” replied the young man, smiling.
He stepped forward.
But you—is there nothing that you want?”
The enemy was marching upon Lens, with the intention, doubtless, of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of France.
“That order does not concern me,” replied Milady, coldly, “since it bears another name than mine.”
But he is mistaken; I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point.”
At the noise Felton made in entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.
Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you will go away without being too malcontent.”
“Diamond!” exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step; “what diamond are you talking about?”
This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement.
“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune!
He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roquette.
The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian
Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher encrusted with gold.
Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less cruel than you.
“Willingly,” replied De Chatillon.
At five o’clock the next morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered Béthune.
“You are gathering your crop, sir?” said Monte Cristo, smiling.
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan,” cried Aramis, “you are killing me!”
“Where was this window with white hangings?” asked the countess.
When D’Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos advised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to engage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.
“So far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.”
“‘Wretch!’ returned the old man, ‘what hast thou done?’ and he gazed with terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife buried in her bosom.
Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in half an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d’Épinay and his witnesses.
But M. de Tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years—a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for D’Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action.
The old man obeyed.
The work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.”
“I bear that of your brother.”
Rumor will probably be busy respecting me, my occupations, my manner of living—that will signify but little, that concerns God, you, and myself.”
The young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them.
Aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins.
Two Angelic Faces.
What hinders it?” exclaimed the king.
“Yes, my lord; and what am I to do with this young gentleman?”
“And you are far too exacting.
“‘I,’ said the traveller, ‘am called Sinbad the Sailor.’”
Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.
After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed one upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet.
Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of Athos.
Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Cromwell.”
No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of the word.”
She placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively; never had she appeared more beautiful.
One day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the hôtel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand.
The quick, eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him.
The count was alone with Morrel, who remained motionless as a statue.
“Father,” he said, “do you reflect that you are bidding me to live?”
* The reader may ask, “How came Planchet here?” when he was left “stiff as a rush” in London.
“Do you permit us to open this casket?” asked the notary.
Egad!” cried Aramis, “you set me thinking.
“His name, tell it me!”
A woman could go up a ladder like that.”
What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation; what a delicious abbé you would have made!”
He endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude.
“For all this,” continued Milady, “I should long ago have revenged myself on him if, and I don’t know why, the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him.”
Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever shown you—a frank and honorable countenance.”
“My dear count,” cried Morcerf, “you are at fault—you, one of the most formidable logicians I know—and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist.
“Ah, my lord, ’tis not easy to make people say what they don’t wish to let out.”
“No misfortune has happened to the queen?” cried Buckingham, the instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question.
“’Tis the appointment Monsieur de Tréville held, you ask of me.”
On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight.
“Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal.
Benedetto, if still living, will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly punished in his turn.
At the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering likewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse, which, on reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.
The devil it does!” said La Ramee, scratching his head; “you are in the wrong to tell me that, my lord.
Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling.
The same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Tréville—the counsels being thrown into the bargain.
“Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,” replied the doctor abruptly.
“Well, there is on the wall of my cell, scratched with a nail, a proverb, which says, ‘Like master, like servant.’”
I know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the daughter of Danglars.”
With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre, and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet.
Two aces!”
My God!”
There were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three thousand.
After which, the cardinal, who had been informed that D’Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him, took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke.
Franz took his hat and went away in haste.
Duc d’Harcourt, Fontrailles, and the others escaped; De Rieux was inclined to do likewise, but I told him they wouldn’t look for us where we were.
On the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse.
“But I—where shall I go meanwhile?”
The mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe.
I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours.
“Yes.”
“I am ruined,—completely ruined!”
“But not before one o’clock,” replied D’Artagnan.
Danglars’ Signature Chapter 105.
“‘Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young Countess of San-Felice?’
“Porthos would be angry, my dear Monsieur Mousqueton, but I pardon you, only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke, so be gay—come along.”
“They are robbers, perhaps,” he muttered.
Valentine, will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?”
He described the death of the other soldier, and the perils they had encountered.
“Why?”
The procurator’s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse.
“Yes, madame,” replied the astonished king; “but why do you ask that?”
“Has your excellency anything to ask me?” said Vampa with a smile.
Two visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him with all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires.
I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed.
“Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,” added Danglars.
40174m
“Mockery,” muttered Athos, savagely; “royal honors to one whom they have murdered!”
“Oh, my lord,” he cried, with an expression of stupefaction in his face; “you haven’t the heart to kill me!”
The most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers.
“Leave you?
And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening before.
“Ah, _perbacco_, indispensable, were they?”
The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her.
“It would take too long to tell you, besides, you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all.
Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad ideas, be even criminal—but live.”
Bonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her, D’Artagnan would have returned home, since he had so promised.
The singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing-room.
“Well, as for me, I prefer Hannibal.”
The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded.
M. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did not even raise his head.
But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced, “His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.” The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerf’s narrative had impressed them, and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion.
They made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses.
He meditates.
“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded.”
You formerly lived, I believe in the Allées de Meilhan, on the fourth floor?”
Now, as they had already traveled eleven leagues, D’Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether Porthos were or were not in the inn.
“How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning?”
The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged.
Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle-field.
I might as well say Count Benedetto.
Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife.
I have already often told you of this; you must not forget it, for it is a great defect in a rider.
It was Aramis.
It was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides.
Conferences.

“Give the lackeys money, and they will start.”
“But,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the fish-pond.”
Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her husband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes the example of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her life—though Marie de Médicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be believed, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which Anne of Austria always refused him—Anne of Austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her dearest favorites.
“Poor Athos!” said he; “he will never guess what all this means.
The above-mentioned purchase was made on his highness’s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.
Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon the wind, reached him.
“You will soon know.”
“Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned no names?”
I forget how, but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy.”
“That is to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “that you will wait until I have proved myself worthy of it.
I will go there, where I expect to find letters, and you go to the first tavern in the town, to L’Epee du Grand Henri for instance, refresh yourselves, and in two hours be upon the jetty; our boat is waiting for us there.”
A Letter from Charles the First.
“What is the matter?” said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and constrained tone.
“So,” D’Artagnan resumed, “you will not become a partisan of Mazarin’s?”
Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name anybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known.
Your Eminence may perceive,” continued Athos, knitting his brow, for this sort of investigation began to annoy him, “that we have not come out without our arms.”
“The devil!”
The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence.
“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron, and tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.”
“Whether I am in my senses or not,” answered Franz, “that is the way I feel.”
I’m not the man you take me for; you are in Captain Rogers’s post, are you not?
You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more unhappy lover than you.”
Aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried him on with the others.
“Yes,” said Albert, “but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Cristo.”
Milady smiled.
“Doubtless, answer me.”
The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal.
the past is another thing,” said Athos, sighing; “the past and the future.”
“Nay,” said the Count; “I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.
“And your fee?”
If she is a cardinalist, she has no fanaticism, at least.”
“I want to know the route I am to follow,” said D’Artagnan.
“Not even to Athos or Porthos?”
“Well, my friend, I am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much.”
Luigi asked permission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house.
It is my will, Morrel.

“Doctor, doctor!” cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming.
“It is important, therefore, monseigneur, that I should be informed as to the intentions of France.

Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.
“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the president.
Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Tréville six days instead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights—for they set out on the twenty-fourth at five o’clock in the evening, and as a further kindness M. de Tréville post-dated the leave to the morning of the twenty-fifth.
“Upon my honor,” said Rochefort, “it takes you, my dear countess, to perform such miracles!”
In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new-born child.
“And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame?” asked Aramis, haughtily.
“Nothing is impossible,” gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.
His three companions joined him.
“Yes,” said they all, with one accord.
“Bah!” said Albert, staring.
Who art thou?” cried he, clasping his hands.
“Are you for Mazarin or for the princes?”
He opened his eyes upon utter darkness.
“Oh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a ring which was placed there.
“Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?”
“Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained.”
I am not precisely rich, though I am pretty well off.”
“Bah,” said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio’s manner, “why not?”
That’s a great story to tell me, Porthos!
I hope we shall have something better to do to-night than to draw the sword.”
“That is to the purpose.
Athos remained motionless, looking after him until he turned the corner of the street.
“Horrible, horrible,” exclaimed Athos.
And perhaps, my God!” added he, with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him, “perhaps sooner than you wish.”
The two Musketeers met at the gate.
“Would her death affect anyone’s interest?”
You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me.”
Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, to M. Danglars’.
“Stolen?
The receiver started back.
“Ah!
As soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things.
Blacas, let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.” Villefort’s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.
“Yes, your excellency.
“We should be very hard to please, madam,” returned Albert, “did we not think him delightful.
A hundred thousand francs for a fowl!”
“In getting introduced to her, my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court.”
And De Winter glancing around him, Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly.
“Yes, certainly.”
“Why did you not say so at once, my dear sir!
“He is very gracious,” thought the queen; “can he have guessed my errand?”
In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.
“Marvelous!” exclaimed Porthos, looking at the Gascon with the most profound admiration.
“So you are free now, and rich?”
Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience; if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux; at Bracieux alone, I have twenty thousand francs in gold.
The queen, on whom he threw himself as sole support, seemed to him now not much to be relied upon.
“If your Majesty is so,” said Tréville, “we are.”
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such learning is very rare among ladies.”
We will return someday to pray over her grave.”
He had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor, who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his aristocratic habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.
“Well, then, I will tell you what we must do.
Then the porter raised some difficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had a louis for his trouble, and they went on their way.
Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women, the wound soon closed.

But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent.

Someone is coming!

The rock yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally disappeared in the ocean.
Have I not told you so, gentlemen?
“And one for the cardinal,” muttered the prince.
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny; we’ll have a supper here under your direction.”
“But not every one; a deputation of two or four people.”
You must make some reformation in that quarter.”
He commanded with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed.
de Morcerf,” continued Beauchamp, “looked at this woman with surprise and terror.
“But Athos!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.
Well, undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings; teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant; and repeat often and loudly, so that all may know it, that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin, her lover and her destroyer; begin this work to-day, this instant even, and in three days I shall expect the result.
“And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town, contrary to the agreement which kept it there.

In his youth D’Artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military, but he was cured of all those hot-headed propensities; besides, he had the cardinal’s hundred pistoles in his pocket, so he went into the hotel without a word.
We are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of Heaven; we are the poor, succored by God.”
I will return soon to learn the result of your trip.”

1.F.6.
Were you not already rich enough—you who possess nearly a million?
“I wrote or studied.”
“Yes.”
“Extraordinary, did you say?”
It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome, the hideous scoundrel!
“Well, this evening will come, thank God!
I point one of the poniards at La Ramee’s breast and I say to him, ‘My friend, I am sorry for it, but if thou stirrest, if thou utterest one cry, thou art a dead man!’”

“It is for that reason you see me so early.”
“But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive?”
Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès, and then again on the gloomy and menacing Fernand.
Why, it is as good as a century!
Section 2.
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.
Allow me, then, to avoid dishonor by death; let me take refuge in martyrdom.
“You have, then, overheard our conversation?” asked Mme.
I am quite of your opinion, sir, and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself, without prejudices, vigilant and incorruptible.”
“How, go then?” exclaimed D’Artagnan.
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Athos.
“‘Woman!’
God will help you.”
He had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his own, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her.
“‘Oh, leave me!’ said I.
That was your fault.”
Monsieur d’Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse.
“This is what you asked for,” he said, “and what I promised to give you.”
“Juxon!” cried Charles, “Juxon, thank you, my last friend; you come at a fitting moment.”
The king motioned him to accompany them.
“And who is this third person?”
Albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry the intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more turns, they did not again see the calash, which had turned up one of the neighboring streets.
“Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish, or I am a lost man and you are also.”
“Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,” replied the valet.

“And besides,” said Beauchamp, “with a collar above his cravat, an open coat and white waistcoat!
I also have made my preparations this morning.”
The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most delightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the Colonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their _fêtes_ have a European celebrity.
“Arrested!
Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses.

He has but one fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment to what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?”
Look after the house, wife, and I shall be back in two hours,” and Caderousse left the house in haste, and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken.
“Oh, but God is above!
“No, thank you.
Oh, how I love you!” said Buckingham.

“Did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease, an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it—seasickness, tempest, captivity?
I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget the service I do him.”

“Will you dine with me?” asked Harrison of D’Artagnan.
Faith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice.”
“He is a millionaire—his income is 500,000 francs.”
You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.”
He then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the Jolly Miller.
For in truth, I think I have hitherto been deceived in you.
If they continue to advance, we must fire again.
I will summon him hither.”
I can never forgive myself!”
“That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird, I will continue answerable for him.”
His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time.
“Well.” inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time directed her _lorgnette_ at the box, “what do you think of our opposite neighbor?”
thou hast no confidence in me!
“It is you, Mordaunt,” he said.
“But as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” he cried; “Vade retro Satanas!”
“‘“And you, sir,” continued the president, with a calmness still more terrible than the general’s anger, “I advise you not to touch your sword.” The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however he did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,—“I will not swear.”
“Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell.”
Bonacieux, who, convinced by what she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.
A merry morning to you, Sunshine.
It was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first.
“And quite a national one, too,” replied Albert with gratified pride.
Did you say he was coming?”

‘Here,’ he said, ‘I am very straightforward in my dealings—take your choice.’
“For my part, I think what they say is very well said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.”
“Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done.”
“What do you want with me, my friend?” said Aramis, with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the Church.

He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm.
“He leaves me five hundred thousand livres.”
D’Artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to Athos.
“There!
Carmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino.
“Ready money.”
“No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.”
Avast, there, all hands!
It was at this moment D’Artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace, in the coadjutor’s carriage, and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies-in-waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them.

The woman’s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to his face.
“What are we going to do, i’faith?
“When shall we two walk together?” Athos then said to Aramis.
Do you know the decision we have come to, mother?”
“Alas,” said Edmond, smiling, “these are the treasures the cardinal has left; and the good abbé, seeing in a dream these glittering walls, has indulged in fallacious hopes.”
Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a Catholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind.
“I did not recognize the chevalier in armor, sir!” said Raoul, blushing; “though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger.”
Why should I leave you?”
In half an hour La Ramee returned, full of glee, like most men who have eaten, and more especially drank to their heart’s content.
“I do.”
With _three_ fingers, to be sure—one for the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost.”
Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind.
Beauchamp pulled out his watch.
The marquis rang, a servant entered.
“At Auteuil, near Paris.”
If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will suffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough.
“Come,” he said, “’tis a warning from Heaven.

“Oh,” said Monte Cristo, “my fondness may blind me, but I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction, and his father’s position is good.”
“What is the prisoner doing?” inquired Vampa of the sentinel.
Ha, ha, ha!” and a frightful, demoniac laugh finished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle.
“What is it?” asked the baroness.
He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought, rose, staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure.
“Who was it you were talking with over there?” she asked.
On the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with stories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about the court.
“I know, monsieur le curé,” said the beggar, “that you have always been very kind to me, and therefore I, in my turn, will be serviceable to you.”

You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.
Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him wonderfully well.
The king was a few steps behind me, when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow.

“Gentlemen,” resumed the newcomer, “you are, as I am, in search of a woman who,” added he, with a terrible smile, “must have passed this way, for I see a corpse.”
“Such are for royalty, and we are simple commoners.”
He picked up the paper, and, recognizing his wife’s writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its contents; it ran as follows:
“If I am not yet a Musketeer,” said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Tréville’s hôtel, “at least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven’t I?”
“But,” resumed Athos, “I recur to my first proposal.
“Of the cardinal.”
“You, to be sure!” said D’Artagnan, pressing Athos’s hand.
My first business will be to dispose of this diamond.”
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground.
Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile.
“Tell me,” continued Winter, always possessed by the same idea, “is there not a tradition in France that Henry IV., the evening before the day he was assassinated, when he was playing at chess with M. de Bassompiere, saw clots of blood upon the chessboard?”
“Well then, your eminence,” said the queen, becoming impatient, “what is your answer?”

The young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father’s breast.
Those two men were the Count de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache.
What man?”

In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage, and the stems of two old oak trees, the refuge of the squirrel, startled by the travelers, were in deep shadow.
“Help to put me on the bed; I think I shall feel better there.”
“Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds.”
“Yes; there’s the landlord of the Lamb, and Gros-Louis the farmer; they both live in the Rue des Ursulines.”
He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends’ arms.
“Alas, yes,” murmured De Winter.
“No vampire,” cried Beauchamp.
“By Bacchus!” rejoined Mazarin, impatiently, “it’s about an hour since I asked you for that very thing, wooden-head that you are.”
“Well, a pleasant journey.”
“Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach, and disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the influence of delirium.”
My sister is happily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer needs my useless life.
I suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket?”

“I always accept.”
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT
Consider, in short, your people who love you and who yet are famished, who have no other wish than to bless you, and who, nevertheless—no, I am wrong, your subjects, madame, will never curse you; say one word to them and all will be ended—peace succeed war, joy tears, and happiness to misfortune!”
“I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Château d’If.
The keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so many utter the same things,—indeed, he heard nothing else.
In eight days the campaign would open, and he would be compelled to leave Paris; D’Artagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege.
I know that you were one of them, my uncle, and that you cried louder than the others: ‘She must die.’ Therefore I warn you, and listen well to my words, that they may be engraved upon your memory, never to be forgotten: this murder, which has robbed me of everything—this murder, which has deprived me of my name—this murder, which has impoverished me—this murder, which has made me corrupt, wicked, implacable—I shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices, when I discover them!”

“For shame, M. de Villefort!” said Renée, becoming quite pale; “don’t you see how you are frightening us?—and yet you laugh.”
Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat.
“Monsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.”
The valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the Palais Royal.
The generation who follow us are very precocious.”
“But once again, that gentleman—where is he?
It was Planchet, but so completely transformed, thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind, that D’Artagnan himself could hardly recognize him.
By whom did the queen send you this jewel?”
So you and the cardinal have been talking about me?
They ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantès felt that they took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to and fro.
To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible.
But do you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so many questions?”
Madame Danglars and Eugénie were going out at that moment; they heard the cause of the disturbance.
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer.
I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne; and that my lord, after having been present at the christening, should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the Pope.”
“In honest truth, Raoul?” said Athos, pressing his hand.
He already knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German.
“Who arrested you?”
“He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there; behold!”
Faria saw this.
Return on Sunday.’ On the Sunday following I did return to him.
Danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, “Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” He got up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head.
“No,” said the banker; “I have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.”
“Some condemned soldier, perhaps,” suggested Athos, “whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide.”
“Well?” said Milady.
“I hope so.”
I am about to struggle for the last time with them.
“No, my lord duke,” replied La Ramee, in the fullness of his heart; “I say what I think; there is no compliment in what I say to you——”
“Of me?
And yet I have punished her—I have dared to tell her—_I_ have—‘Repent and die!’ But no, she must not die; she shall live, and with me.
He tried to follow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot,—his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain with living fire.
No; I will go down, seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged.”
Two musketeers were pacing the court, to whom D’Artagnan called by their names.
Who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection?”
“I hope I am not the cause.”
Haydée had taken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.
“Yours wholly and most affectionately
All I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.”
“On your honor?”
“You see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us,” said Athos.
“Oh, you frighten me!
In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south.
“One word more,” said Monte Cristo.
“What, Athos?
From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music, with the whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds.
“I thought I did,” replied Athos; “but no doubt I was mistaken.” And he returned D’Artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.
“Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.”
I know you are not rich, Madame Coquenard, and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them.
“An H and an N, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.”
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears there’s something fresh here.”
“Right, Dantès, quite right.
“But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think,” said Raoul.
It was written and signed by Albert.
“Do you know who this pretended duchess is?
It was no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was apparently beloved.
“Are you all here?” he asked.
“We must pursue them,” said Groslow, “they can’t be gone far, and we will sink them, passing over them.”
“Who is he?”
“Then,” said the young man, with anxiety, “I shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position.”
“With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping, you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so.”
The hostess replied only by gasps.
“Ah, my faith, yes!” said Porthos and D’Artagnan, at the same time; “we are coming nearer to it now.”
Buckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter, undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.
Kitty entered to bring some sherbet.
“In short,” said Porthos, “when all my expenses are paid, I shall have, at most, thirty crowns left.”
It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII.
“Bring them here.” The waiter did as he was desired.
Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored silk, embroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue.
“Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you even to require a million——”
“Without doubt.”
45.
“Listen,” said the abbé, extending his hand over the wounded man, as if to command him to believe; “this is what the God in whom, on your death-bed, you refuse to believe, has done for you—he gave you health, strength, regular employment, even friends—a life, in fact, which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience.
Meantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between his mustaches, “These four men must positively be mine.”
“Dicers’ oaths!” said Athos, while D’Artagnan went to conduct Kitty downstairs.
Then turning toward the prisoner, “Take away that man,” he said, “and keep him carefully in sight.
He would have written—or——”
“You believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be?
As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.
What was your deputy called?”
“‘A soldier of the French army.’
After Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles II., and then James II., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince of Orange, a stadtholder who becomes a king.
The lackeys were sent to their several posts, except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway.
“Ah!
“And M. Noirtier?”
The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore.
France is large; the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant.”
I have perhaps offended you in your creed; but it was without wishing to do so, I swear.
“No,” he muttered, “the doubt I felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts for vengeance.
D’Artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower, unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable; for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aramis.
“Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery.
“Well, you do not answer, cardinal, what do you think about it?”
Five minutes later the carriage stopped, having reached Cours la Reine.
“May we inquire what is this recipe?” asked Debray.
He has faith in himself; he has faith in his friends; he wishes also to have faith in his queen.
Of three Guardsmen of the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the assistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hôtel of M. de Tréville, crying, “To the rescue, Musketeers!
Repeat it!” cried D’Artagnan; “it will make a little change.”
It was a grain of a reddish color, which dissolved immediately.
“But what is to be done?” said D’Artagnan.
“All the details of his coming into and going out of the palace—on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune teller—you will tell him, that he may not doubt the correctness of my information; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears, death’s heads, and crossbones—for in case of a surprise, he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world knows, appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending.”
“Nothing,” replied the latter; “only, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.”
“To London.”
Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart!
Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position.
Shall I tell you each ornament of your toilet?
“A man on whom we can depend, I hope.”
“Never!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Whom do you call _that wretch?_” asked Felton.
At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.
Valentine uttered a cry of horror; Morrel took her in his arms, as if to defend her from some unknown danger.
“_Ma foi!_” said Maximilian, in consternation.
Franz complimented Albert, who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction.
Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find a shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.
(“Porthos,” murmured D’Artagnan, “look well at that priest.”
“Then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received?” asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.
“Aramis,” answered D’Artagnan, who did not wish to undeceive Porthos, “Aramis, fancy, has become a monk and a Jesuit, and lives like a bear.
“So far so well,” answered Planchet, alighting, and extending his arms to Mousqueton, the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great lord in disguise, so highly did they estimate the position of Mousqueton.
The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right, and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin, less heroic than the king, had taken the precaution to lower.
“I do not know.”
Are we softened a little?
The young lady went towards Madame Morrel.
“I will not speak again,” said Château-Renaud; “pray have compassion upon me, and do not take up every word I say.”
“Well, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,” said Athos, “that my three companions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, and myself, will go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there an hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.”
The Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of annoyance.
Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.”
Then they departed, without knowing whether they would ever see each other again.
“Precisely,” answered Bertuccio; “but he had, seven or eight years before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles, who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his fortune in another.
“Yes; think you it was the poor servant’s life was coveted?
“Because he is in love.”
The following morning they arrived at Châlons, where the count’s steamboat waited for them.
Thus speaking, he fell back exhausted.
You will conduct us yourself, then, to that door?”
The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young people felt their hearts bound within them.
She saw d’Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain of having emptied during the night.
Had that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father, would probably ere this have been shot.” Villefort’s father laughed.
“As thou seest, Planchet,” said Aramis, whilst Athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of Mousqueton, Bazin and Grimaud.
You are quite upset!
“What, my horse?”
what’s that?” cried the duke.
Have you anything to ask of me?
The two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions.
We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below, which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the guns, the firing of which resounded through that room.
“He is old, covered with wounds, and suffers dreadfully, he says, in travelling.”
“Yes, you may as well take Mousqueton.
That great man who was so revered by D’Artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville, who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back.
“To conspire, no doubt, with your enemies, the Huguenots and the Spaniards.”
“You may perceive, madame, by my uniform, that I am an officer in the English navy,” replied the young man.
All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness.
“The Red Duke is capital.
“Ah, every one seems to be going to see the queen of England.
“A baron, don’t you mean?” cried D’Artagnan, finishing his friend’s sentence.
“I do not reproach you, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “’tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your conduct.”
“The fact is, count,” answered the mother, agreeably flattered, “he has great aptitude, and learns all that is set before him.
“You will not have long to wait,” said the landlord; “they begin to-morrow.”
A loud cry could be heard by her.
For pity’s sake!” cried the young man, whose agony-drawn breath at times, when his head went under water, under the wave, exhaled and made the icy waters bubble.
London is far from Paris, very far, and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers?”
And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood curdle.
“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living together?”
“What is this?”
“Seven or eight leagues at the most.
I have ordered Masses for myself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited.”
“I have confidence in the remedy I propose, and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy.”
“But I have neither my women nor my servants.”
“Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible, you ask her permission to share my repast.”
“I am inclined to think so.”
Anne of Austria returned to her oratory, furious.
“And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said Morcerf, quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator.
With respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor.
Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression.
There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure, each by a different key.
“It seems, then, reserved for me,” said Monte Cristo coldly, “to be the first to do so.”
“Take care, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan; “don’t you see they are aiming?”
“Capital!” exclaimed Albert; “your breakfast shall be waiting.”
“Well?”
“One question first.
“Within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.”
“All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars’ beautiful horses, and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them.”
“Your age?” continued Villefort.
Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream.
“To repeat these signs.” Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket, upon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked.
Porthos was the first to speak.
Now go.” He made a sign to Cocles, who went first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear.
Debray, with the air of a man familiar with the house, entered first into the court, threw his bridle into the hands of a footman, and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to whom he offered his arm, to conduct her to her apartments.
He then began to ascend the path.
I went to work.
Athos turned pale.
Perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer something else.”
Besides, there was no tranquillity in Paris itself.
“And Porthos and Aramis?”
These gentlemen,” added he, turning to the two friends, “will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?”
About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwell’s cuirassiers.
“Is that she, mamma?” asked Eugénie; “almost opposite to us, with that profusion of beautiful light hair?”
And as it is three months since you have been here, and though, distracted as you must be in your important occupations, you have forgotten to pay me my rent—as, I say, I have not tormented you a single instant, I thought you would appreciate my delicacy.”
He will be furious; but I don’t care.
“Thomson & French,” said he; “do you know this house, monsieur?”
“I think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible.
The captain of the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune.
Excuse me;” and he began to laugh loudly, but nervously.
“But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?”
I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you not?”
“Oh!
I remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much.
But amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme.
“No.”
“I will keep it,” returned Morcerf; “but I fear that you will be much disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons.

In short, she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study.
“In that case,” said Athos, “Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning—that will reduce the sum to five thousand livres.
to speak to you about me?”
When are you to be married?”
It is important that he should receive it before eleven o’clock.
No door gave entrance to the room.
The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via Macello.” Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude.
Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak.
“But wait a minute.”
I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th of next month.
The guards asked permission of La Ramee, who gave it to them, but not till the evening, however; until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone.
“Étienne,” said he, “see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.”
“Trust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons, but we must not put faith in appearances.
“And,” said Cavalcanti, “I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size.”
“Fasten it to the poop with a rope; put the oars into it, so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord.
“Yes, at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham; it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds.”
At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone.
“Yes, your French husband.
I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence.
This evening, or tomorrow, the cardinal will send someone to take you away.”
As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave him a friendly smile, and said, “A perfect harmony reigns, sire, between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all.”
0065m
D’Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.
“Pardon me, my dear friend,” said D’Artagnan, “I think you said ‘pardieu!’”
“You appear quite aghast.
“Oh, thank me again!” said the count; “tell me till you are weary, that I have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require this assurance.”
“How?
“And you couldn’t remember?”
“Or fifteen.”
He was, in fact, in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of God once pointed at him, everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry.
“Never fear.”
What could explain Athos’s having re-entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table?
Athos, at the same moment, moved by a similar impulse, looked back also.
“Sir,” said the count, “the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with your resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M. d’Épinay, even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry, which he will not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty.”
Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command?
“Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day?”
“How many guns, gentlemen?”
There was a magic effect in the count’s words, which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man.
“Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.”
“In a moment.”
Has Morrel, whom we know, been killed?
“‘Ah!’ cried the cardinal, ‘I thought you were a Gascon, my friend?’
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science.
Remember, if you talk, if you babble, if you get drunk, you risk your master’s head, who has so much confidence in your fidelity, and who answers for you.
“When the Lord commands,” said Mordaunt, “His commands are not to be disputed.
“Ha, ha!” cried Lord de Winter; “ha, ha!
He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to her chamber.
You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me.
“She will ruin us!” returned the prince.
“Sire,” murmured Lord Leven, crushed by shame, “sire, we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity.”
“You know what Athos told you the other day; you eat at everybody’s mess.
“I awoke as the clock was striking six.
Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind.
“The devil!
Section 3.
Chapter LI.
I love you as my life, for you are the best, the noblest of created beings!”
You make me young and happy again by it.
“What do you want with us?” he asked of Groslow.
“It may, perhaps, come to this in time,” observed Monte Cristo; “you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and simplicity is always perfection.”
Mazarin groaned.
“No,” said the paralytic.
The throng was terrific, and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination.
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
But nothing could be farther from his thoughts.
No objection was raised, and the infant was given up to her.
“I trust you have brought this rabble to reason.”
Kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women.
In the meantime please to sit down, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.’
d’Avrigny!” cried Villefort; “or rather I will go for him myself.”
Didn’t I say so?” cried Planchet.
The jailer stared.
It was on that occasion that my ancestor, Enguerrand de la Fere, was made a knight of the Order of St. Michael; besides which, the king, fifteen years afterward, gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house, also a lovely specimen of workmanship.
And, _morbleu_, why do you not go yourself?
I have proof of it.
“A son of Monsieur de Broussel’s servant, and a lad that, I promise you, in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs.”
D’Artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure.
“That is right,” replied the mendicant; “dismiss your lackey.”
“I know what I am saying,” continued the marchioness; “I must hurry you, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage.
The latter put his hand to his sword, and said, with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death:
Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel, himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns.
“Yes, I do remember,” replied the countess.
“Yes, go, go!” said she to her brother; “the effects _are_ drawing near, on the contrary; but you, weak fool, will not see them until it is too late to shun them.”
The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind.
“I don’t at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.
“Send the case before the judges; it is their business to judge, and they shall judge.”
The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor.
“You may.”
This man, who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob—not a muscle of whose face was stirred, either at Mazarin’s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude—seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being, who, having participated in past events similar to those now occurring, was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place.
The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.
“‘Beware!’ said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet heard.
Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends.
...ngle in the second;
“Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.”
“When I awoke, a fresh meal was served.
What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it?
Remain, sir,” he added to Aramis, who had moved to leave the room.
“No, he will not desert,” said the king; “he can always be found, as Tréville says.
Adieu!
“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity.
if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle.
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture, scarcely to be understood.
“Was it not agreed,” asked the count, “that not only my person, but also that of my friends, should be respected by you?”
Let them know, on the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by Providence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although they escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they are only exchanging time for eternity.”
An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and Lorraine.
“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s hands,—then I shall be contented.”
“That such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man.”
“Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at Amiens; that I will have a little romance made of it, wittily turned, with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance.”
“‘Multitudinously’ is good,” said Château-Renaud.
“Milady!” murmured Athos.
He did as he said.
“Much obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only—for the information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.”
“I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.”
“Your son says he requires money.”
“And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”
Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.
Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room.
“You are married, then?” said the priest, with a show of interest, glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.
but the king is asleep.”
But what makes you doubt it?”
You know there are different sorts.”
Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!”
“How?
D’Artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos, but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it, he consented that Porthos should share his couch with him.
“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”
“Not worth speaking of?” cried Château-Renaud; “life is not worth speaking of!—that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel.
He was nineteen when he entered the Château d’If; he was thirty-three when he escaped.
The day after this important information had been given to the king’s attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue Férou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbé Busoni were within.
“What!
Villefort had calculated rightly.

“On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like—we can sail as well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.”
“She demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,—‘Giovanni,’ said she, ‘you should have brought this child with you; we would have replaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in consequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.’ In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich.”
Take them away, Juxon; their tears will deprive me of the courage to die.”
I also intend from this time to work on my own account.
“Come along, Athos, come along!” cried D’Artagnan; “now we have found everything except money, it would be stupid to be killed.”
“Monseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.”
The gendarme smiled.
Coquenard, in that tone which says, “Take my advice, don’t touch them.”
On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open.
Curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_, and he was recognized.
“I am going alone.”
This state of mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow.
“Go on!
“‘No,’ said Caderousse, ‘we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.’
“Yes,” said Athos, “by his own nephew.”

“To any one, Laporte,” the child said; and then added in a loud voice, “to any one except Mancini.”
“Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.”
The past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others.

In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses, which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap.
“Lord, monsieur!
“Who knows?” said Gondy; “such men are like thunderbolts—one recognizes them only when they have struck.”
A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain; and two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, appeared through the openings of the tapestry.
Three of my best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the king, his service much at heart—three of my best soldiers, I say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning.
“You did well; you would have caused him an access of his disease.
“No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent’s message.”
“You call yourself Bonacieux?” interrupted D’Artagnan.
Dawn was shedding its pallid, placid glimmer on the purple ocean, when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass, above which gleamed a triangular sail; then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save.
“Well, now let us talk a little seriously,” said Milady, in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to D’Artagnan’s chair.
The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with Milady’s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.
Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge.
Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.
God knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home.”
He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard.
“Not so loud, father, I entreat of you—for your own sake as well as mine.
“Well, in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure, my dear Monsieur Groslow, for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it.”
Exteriorly, nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé.
The young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of will and not the power of execution.
“Pooh!” said the duke, too much astonished to believe it true.
But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn.
“Yes,” said Danglars.
“Yes, and at the same time making a hole in the wall.”
It is not I who strike M. de Morcerf; it is Providence which punishes him.”
To form the slightest idea of his feelings, one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven.
D’Artagnan wrote the child’s name in his tablets.
“And what sort of revenge would you take?”
106, and good-bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker!
“It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not dictate to a master.”
“You had never anything to complain of?” said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé.
I leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune—alone with that strong-winged eagle which God sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet.
“Adieu; or rather, _au revoir_.”
Once more Danglars bit his lips.
“Deign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful!
“Ah, it’s all one,” said the host; “I have lost two customers, but this one remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come.
“Behind the Luxembourg; that’s a charming spot for such amusements as the one I propose to you.”
“Ah!
If he were to lose them——”
d’Épinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present.”
“No, my lord,” replied the Gascon; “on the contrary, we think of announcing very soon that we have you here.”
Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep, without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose.
Your song is as dismal as a ‘De profundis’; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we must hear such things as these, no mortal can hold out.”
“There is only one thing which grieves me,” observed the major, “and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.”
Scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him.
“Only grazed a little,” replied D’Artagnan; “my fingers were caught between two stones—that of the wall and that of my ring—and the skin was broken.”
Meantime D’Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier, attacking him with his sword.

“Sire,” said Athos, “this is not a moment for recrimination, but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman.
D’Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.
Now, of two hundred and fifty-one members who composed the parliament, there were one hundred and ninety-one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon.
“Devil take these Puritans,” said Mazarin aside; “they are carved from granite.” Then he added aloud, “But you have relations left you?”
When the emperor returned, he wrote, implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist.
The same officer appeared.
Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission.
This gun had an excellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the precision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock, and had then cast the gun aside.
“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”
without caring about them myself, I live among those who are much occupied in them.
Raoul at the same time seized one of the young man’s hands and placed it on the mane, which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man.
The handsome Madeleine announced to D’Artagnan that Planchet had returned, bringing Mousqueton with him, who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit.
“Yes, sir,” replied the abbé; “and you are the person whom M. de Boville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect of police?”
This child has caused me to recover what I had lost.
The name of D’Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin, who, although he did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635, that is to say, about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative, * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage, address and loyalty.
“My dear host, and you, signora,” said Albert, in Italian, “excuse my apparent stupidity.
“I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship,” said Planchet, putting the bag under his arm.
About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the time of Louis XIII.

“It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister, since she was dead.”
Chapter XV.
Dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty.
“_A propos_, you have probably one or two friends?”
“That is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?”
After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto.
“Athos lend me Grimaud, who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English, and can act as my interpreter.”
Ah!
“Sure enough,” said the general.
Mazarin felt a shiver run through him—a chill even to his heart’s core.
“Certainly, women alone know how to dissimulate,” said Monte Cristo to himself, glancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur, and embracing his wife.
“You have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Milady.
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musketeers.
“Why do you say that?” asked the queen, almost timidly.

She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had faith in the genius of evil—that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.
The president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the investigation should take place.
Well, Monsieur Laporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as she is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she is by everybody.”
Mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence, but continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini.
And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti.
He arose and stood near Mousqueton.
“There!” said D’Artagnan, “what did I tell you?
“And then, and then?”
“Ah,” cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbé’s two hiding-places.
eh?
Charles rose and turned toward Parry, whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture.
“And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty?” asked M. de Tréville, feigning the most profound astonishment.
my son!
“Silence, monsieur!
At length Villefort, the most composed of all, spoke:
And will you not torment me any more?”
“As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air, attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions.
“You have a broker, have you not?”
“Was it to tell me that, madame,” coldly replied Gondy, “that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence?”
“Remember that his name is all my secret.”
“Mazarin is almost king,” answered Athos; “Madame Henrietta is almost no longer queen.”
All this time the soldiers were calling out, “Stop!
Does he correspond with Aramis?
‘And yours?’
That is my failing—a capital failing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.”
VOLUME FIVE Chapter 96.
The king called the cardinal.
She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N. When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted.
Is my father here?”
The count recalled Baptistin, who had left the room after delivering the letter.
“What is it?”
Toward two o’clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and cried, “Who goes there?” somebody replied that he was mistaken, and went away.
‘Conscience, what hast thou to do with me?’ as Sterne said.
“Do you wish it known that you are interested about him, monsieur le comte?”
An Adventure on the High Road.
His itinerary was promptly determined: he would go to Dammartin, from which place two roads diverge, one toward Soissons, the other toward Compiegne; there he would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained.
As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men.
He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog.
In saying these words D’Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved.
But how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave?”
I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future.
When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed, lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another.
“But I,” cried Morrel, groaning with sorrow, “I love her!”
This woman is certainly a great liar.
We are judges of wounds, we old soldiers,” Athos added, smiling.
Five or six minutes elapsed.
“M.
“Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?”
Ah!
“Upon my honor,” said the prince.
Albert went to his room, and dressed with unusual care.
D’Artagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends.
Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor.
“Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.”
“What do you say, Edmond?”
He arrived at his usual hour, with a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through the corridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues.
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen’s hand led her to the window.
This was the Abbé Scarron, always laughing, joking, complimenting—yet suffering—and toying nervously with a small switch.
Friquet, seeing this fine officer thus walk away, followed by two guards, amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage.
I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved.
_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow.
“No, I am alone in the world.”
During the whole time he was speaking, the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor’s harangue; but terminating as it did with such a phrase, the only one which could be caught at by the jokers, Anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites, which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies.
It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the establishment.
“Go,” said Valentine, “whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.”
Let me die; that is all.
Turning towards Athos and his friends, “Gentlemen,” said he, “allow me to correct your words, if you please.
The Unknown
“Your excellency’s name——”
I dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you?”
“In the examination which precedes ordination, a thesis is always a requisite.”
More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I don’t know what’s what.’ You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business.
“Something which will surprise you.”
“The queen’s famous diamond,” answered D’Artagnan, with a sigh.
“Diplomat or not, I don’t know; I only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden Fleece and the Garter.”
The young man uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself.
Your history is quite a romance, and the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they be gilded like yourself.
In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them.
The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue.
“Oh, no,—no, not yet,” he cried; “do not forsake me!
“You see I am perfectly composed,” said Albert.
“Yes.”
“Ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’Avrigny.
Fontrailles, his aide-de-camp, had an arm broken; his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him, maddened by pain.
“Sire,” replied the queen, with a faltering voice, “because, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them.”
“‘Ah, ah,’ said the chief, ‘I now understand why Carlini stayed behind.’
Whether he kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he was tonight like everybody else.
Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort’s hands, exclaimed, “My child was alive?” said she; “you buried my child alive?
Raoul remained silent, for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit.
Why, this Count of Monte Cristo must be a nabob?”
“Oh, Lord, yes, monsieur!
I am betrayed on all sides.
“Really, sir,” D’Artagnan said to him, “I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue.
And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate was addressed to them.
But what help is there for it!
At ten o’clock every one was in his appointed position; at half-past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day.
“Have you made inquiry?”
“By my faith, ’twould be excusable in him to tremble,” replied Aramis, “for even I feel a shudder at the recollection; hold, just above that tree is the little spot where I thought I was killed.”
D’Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak.
On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could, of course, tell nothing but what they knew—that they had been seized, stripped and bound.
He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real.
Do not cast yourself against such a rock; he would break you like glass.”
Bonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.
The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight, and then left without calling anyone.
“A fine idea that of his,” said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.

Athos appeared.
France has already received Queen Henrietta, and, unintentionally, doubtless, has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country.

“Never mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will answer for it.
This time it _was_ the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with impatience.
“I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman’s.”
“Why did you not say all this before you took action, sir?” she said.
“That’s because they don’t see us,” said Athos.
The queen became thoughtful and smiled, like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger.
Excuse my talking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture.
“In person.”
“Your honors,” said he, “that woman had a child; that child has become a man; the tigress had a little one, the tiger has roused himself; he is ready to spring upon you—beware!”
“What induces you to think so?”
“That which I found at your feet, and replaced in your pocket.”
“Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.”
Oh, you cannot believe what you say!”
Bonacieux; the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him.
“Then you refuse me?”
But he was unable to complete this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the Roman carbineers, Carlini was killed.
The Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed D’Artagnan aside with his hand.
“Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities.”
“She is cowardly,” said Villefort.
Chapter XXXIV.
The duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to him.
Dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed, leaving the rest on the floor.
You will put yourself at the head of the first.
Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, “No, truly, it would take up too much time.”
“Allow me, then, to pass on, since it is not with me you have anything to do.”
It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the minister.
“Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome?”
And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses’ flanks, who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies.
“Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.”
But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk.
“What would you have, my dear fellow?
“Last night, after we left you.”
“Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another.”
He was, as we have already said, perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries.
Wait an instant.” And he pointed his gun at D’Artagnan, who was riding toward him at full speed.
Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided.
A carriage waits your orders, and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go.
“Yes, madame; but on the frontier he was met by Lesly; he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings.
“You’re in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would not be so pressing.”
“My lord, I have been so long shut up, that I am only of one party—I am for fresh air.
“You too, then, are unhappy?” she said.
“Oh, Juxon,” said the king, seizing the bishop’s two hands in his own, “promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet, and for two others also, who, wherever they may be, are on the watch for my safety.”

“What is this?” asked the captain.
“That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument.”
“Who can tell?—a vagabond, a Corsican.”
Well, Morrel, let us both examine the depths of your heart.
“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.
He no longer loved her; he adored her.
“My son!” exclaimed Athos, extending his hand to D’Artagnan.
“A tailor,” said the host; “and for what?”
“And you say this treasure amounts to——”
“Ah, there you are, my good D’Arminges; I have given you a great fright, have I not?
“But you are sure you are not mistaken.”
“Father,” said Benedetto, “I am asked for proofs, do you wish me to give them?”
This thought—the house of Morrel is about to stop payment—bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done.
I went out as if to fetch wood, passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar, and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door, pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me.
It was not the coat, unexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot so perfectly formed—it was none of these things that attracted the attention,—it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high disdain,—these were what fixed the attention of all upon him.
The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau—such is the instability of the human mind—was the sullen face of Grimaud, for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope.
This house, isolated from the rest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu.
What more?”
The road, as D’Artagnan had observed, was the way to Blois.
We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain.
But excuse me, sir, for talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.”
“And what are they to live upon?”
Athos!
Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel.”
Felton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.
Two months ago you were dying with hunger.”
Give it me, that I may see it is not false.”
“Ah, traitor!” muttered D’Artagnan, leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear, “you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse.”
The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it.
“You?”
“My lord,” replied La Ramee, “my lord——”
“Oh, oh!” said Andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did post after me.
Remember to go to the count on the 26th May at seven o’clock in the evening.
“Yes.”
“Who can say whether D’Artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal?
“A friend, a friend!” said Peppino; “but where is the captain?”
The door was closed, and the carriage proceeded.
A year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of prisons.
He waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.
“You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.”
He had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the influential persons of the city; but the report was already in circulation that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done.
“D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, in a reproachful tone, “how could you believe that we had made a disturbance?”
“It is true,” she said, “the arch hypocrite—see!”
“Again that accusation!” cried the queen.
“Tell me what it is.”
“Well?
“That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a remark.”
* Sandy hills about Dunkirk, from which it derives its name.
They knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded.
Still Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.
But he bethought him of M. de Villefort’s promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible.
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much agitated.
Here they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the Palais Royal, Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure.
At the Bois de Boulogne, _ennui_ and hunger attacked me at once,—two enemies who rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of Carlo-republican alliance.
“Well?” said he, on perceiving Aramis.

The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner.
She would invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days.
The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains.
“Where the devil didst thou learn it?”
What says Monsieur the Abbé?
“And why?” asked Scarron; “is he not a man of good birth?”
An officer approached.
“Yes.”
“Monsieur de Guitant, my uncle, has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army.”
‘Do you desire it as ardently as you say?’
Well, Albert, this money, which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored, may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be devoted to the same purpose.
_Holà_, Bazin!
“What are you saying?
“Ah, monsieur!”
“That is to say,” cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step, “that is to say—”
“For what?”
“Who art thou?
“Thirty-five minutes after seven,” said Athos, “by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than you.”
M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless.
Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house.
“Come,” said Anne, “’tis reasonable, since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed;” and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs.

Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity, seconded by a most powerful organization—a man who has not, perhaps, like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of Providence, but of fate.

“Middling.”
Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.

Old Dantès, however, sprang forward.
Ali returned a sign in the negative.
“Really, my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the cardinal, “your coolness startles me.”
On my part, I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be suspected.
“And I,” said M. d’Artagnan.
Coquenard was not less affected by it on her part, for she added, “My cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in Paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.”
“Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil.” Bertuccio slightly started.
“If that is all, it is easily done,” said Porthos.
“So that,” said Monte Cristo, “you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month.”
At these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness, Madame de Morcerf replied:
This was a question the young man asked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover.
Pistache went again around the circle, but stopped at no one, and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark.
Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.
Meanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to meet the receiver-general.
“Have you seen the Greek mistress?”
Under this head, also, Bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell.
“Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville?
Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and tomorrow we shall have more.”
He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon.
Everything in this charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose.
Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being abducted a second time?
“What do you mean by that?”
On his return home, Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray, and Morrel, to see them at the Opera that evening.
“Yes; he exclaimed, ‘Oh!’”
“Go this moment to the Allées de Meilhan, enter the house No.
He was dressed in plain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged.
Why did you give him six pistoles?”
“This place, if Monsieur d’Herblay can procure the key, is the best that we can have,” was the answer.
A moment later the gray-headed man was beside him.
“Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere, but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him.”
“Speak,” said Athos.
Never, till then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot help believing them, Valentine.
The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where Morrel had often waited.
What blows, what blood!”
“Still more; as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street, Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat, shut his door, and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.”
“Sire,” replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation, “your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt.”
The three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.
Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill.
“‘What do you want?’
“Not under present circumstances, monsieur.”
“Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at Rome.”
The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk, who became livid.
He soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied.
“Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo, looking earnestly at the young man, and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian’s face.
“Well, here we are at last,” said one of them.
Remember, madame, if our God forbids falsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.”
“How?”
“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine such a scheme.
I like men of head and heart.
I am of D’Artagnan’s opinion; we have no time to lose in regaining our camp.”
D’Artagnan obeyed.
Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo.
“Do you say,” resumed D’Artagnan, “that you suspect that impertinent gentleman?”
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of it, she abandoned to him.
“I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions,” answered the child, “for if I do I shall learn nothing further.”
my dear friend, you are going to spoil everything—everything is going on famously.
50181m
“Certes, these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged,” thought the terrified D’Artagnan, “and I, no doubt, with them; for from the moment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as an accomplice.
I only ask a brokerage.”
He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him.
“Everything is paid,” replied the host, “and liberally.
“Sir, I am ready.
“Well, my dear Albert,” said Franz, turning towards his friend; “what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?”
“_Peste!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, “the moment for confidences has not yet come.”
Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers of the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are inadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society?
“The devil!” exclaimed Porthos; “there’s Vulcan foundered.”
“And how dressed?” asked Villefort quickly.
“Oh, no,” said Porthos, “it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres!
“I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil, at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,” replied Madame de Villefort, turning away with marked coldness of manner.
“You, Morcerf?” replied the secretary, resting on the stairs.
“The smallpox!
It has four hundred lines, and lasts a minute.”
Bonacieux.
The next day, M. Dessessart’s valet came to D’Artagnan’s lodging, and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.
Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face became covered with blushes.
Was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up?
All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand.
D’Artagnan slipped into the wardrobe.
“They are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.”
“Yes, I inherited this little property when I quitted the army, as I told you.
“This day will be a warm one,” said Planchet, in a warlike tone.
“Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?” inquired the count; “only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.”
30145m
Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits.
When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that D’Artagnan had, was the first to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and De Wardes were already arranged in his mind.
She was very plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning.
Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.
I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about.
“Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests; that is your name, is it not, sir?”
D’Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady, his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents.”
“And I, sir,” said Danglars, “shall be most happy to receive you.”
“Then it is for to-day?” asked the king.
“Good,” said Aramis, taking a purse which Bazin presented to him.
“I thank you, doctor,” said Villefort with indescribable joy; “I never had a better friend than you.” And, as if he feared Doctor d’Avrigny would recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.
All my hopes are blighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is sad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices distract me.
“A year after, madame.”
He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons.
Ask me to lend you half a million and, although such a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less!
“Never, to anyone.”
A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all went well.
ha!” laughed the apparition, “every gentleman seems to have the same fancy, for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad, well mounted like you, as tall as you and of about your age, halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here, and dined here, with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor, upon a pie, of which they haven’t left a mouthful, and two bottles of Macon wine, of which they haven’t left a drop, but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left, and if your worship will but give your orders——”
Planchet met them hard by the shed.
He must wait.
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
“I?” said she, with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer, “I, sir?
“Well, madame, I perceive I must do as you wish.”
Yours will be returned to you tomorrow.
“Can you see what they are doing?”
Your captivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the studs, an order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the annoyance I cause you.”
Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience.
“My good friend,” said Albert, “I beg pardon for my intrusion, but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not.”
“Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole of the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while he smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered—that is, a roulette where he wins without playing, and is no loser when he loses.”
de Chevreuse and Mme.
And is he aware of the danger he has been in?”
But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”
Now, Grimaud, you come here, climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed.
“Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study?
“Yes, it is I,” said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely.
Albert, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud remained alone.
“How so?”
“How so?” asked the Musketeer.
There is everything in a Jesuit convent.”
“Well,” said Caderousse, “why, what a lie he told!
“That gentleman, I say, what has become of him?”
“Do you not know the race?” said he.
“To London, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan.
Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.
“Too late by a minute!” cried he, “too late by a minute!
“It is mere want of occupation.
“Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe; his acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying moments, I say he died of——”
His life is dependent on the information he has given us; if it is true, he shall be free; if false, let him be shot.”
“You are a great politician, my queen,” said Mazarin; “let us hear the means.” And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper.
“Ah,” said he, “here we are, at the last act of the tragedy.
You are free to-night, without fighting; so much the better!
“But after all,” said Lord de Winter, when the three friends had been named, “we do not know who you are.
“It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked.”
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” it cried.
“What do you mean?
“If that be the case,” said D’Artagnan, “they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another.
“Of myself,” cried Morcerf; “_parbleu!_ do you think I cannot be saved as well as anyone else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads?
He lives at the Bedford Tavern, Greenhall Street.
At the same instant the gun was fired, and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.
But my mother—no, not my mother; I mistake—my father intends giving a ball.”
“Hold your tongue,” replied Aramis; “you would make me weep, if such a thing were possible.”
This parallel disturbed his usual politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs.
Anne colored slightly.
why is not Grimaud, the taciturn Grimaud, here?” thought D’Artagnan, “there are so many things his silence would have told me; with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence!”
“But do not keep Raoul with you.”
What has M. Franz to do with it?
“What music?”
“It’s nothing, it’s nothing!” said Milady.
The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag.
1.E.3.
Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was mad.
“Your affair is not bad,” said Athos, after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good; “and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man.
Jacopo pointed towards the horizon.
“No; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were.
“About five minutes,” replied the captain.
Morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered.
50090m
“He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,” said the count, placing his hand on the young man’s shoulder.
“By heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, starting back, “it is——”
“‘The great wars of Romagna had ended; Cæsar Borgia, who had completed his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy.
“Yes, madame,” replied the coadjutor, gravely.
“They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,” returned the count quietly.
D’Artagnan, who had no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his friends.
Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to Franz.
As soon as you feel able to swim we will go.”
Unluckily, as I was then in Bearn, on account of my father’s death, the letter followed me there.
No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed out.
“Halt!” cried Porthos coming forward.
“Ho!
“Buckingham!
40178m
“To what country?” demanded Porthos.
_A propos_,” said M. de Tréville, calling him back.
“My son,” said Anne of Austria, pointing to the musketeer, calm, standing uncovered, “here is Monsieur d’Artagnan, who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women.
You do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of vengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not aware that you had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father had died of hunger!”
“But I do.”
Two hours passed thus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly.
Despite the weight of two bodies, the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air.
Now, to apply it in your case,—to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable?”
At eleven o’clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers, equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich, and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess.
“I will await you at the corner of the Rue du Musée, and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me!”
“Nearly.”
“What do you say?
where is Providence?”
“Swear to be mute.”
“You must be mad, my friend,” said the baroness.
“Run and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
“Madame!” said Athos, “madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass is this?”
She continued, then, as if she had not heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it.
“Of course you sent for a doctor?”
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.
As I am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it.
“But I am really glad to have seen such a sight; and I understand what the count said—that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the only one that causes you any emotion.”
“Once for all, sir,” replied the baroness sharply, “I tell you I will not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband.”
“Make yourself easy, my friend,” replied the abbé.
I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.”
“I’faith, yes!
Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500.
“His mania.”
Grimaud made the sign yes.
“There’s nothing to do in Paris now there’s no Fronde.
“Work slowly,” said the curate; “we leave you in an excellent tone of mind.”
“Come, come, you won’t tell me you don’t know Aramis?”
“Ah,” said D’Artagnan, “I comprehend!
Bonacieux.
“Yes,” continued Athos, “four times only; once at the house of Monsieur Créquy; another time at my own house in the country, in my château at—when I had a château; a third time at Monsieur de Tréville’s where it surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to my lot, and where I lost a hundred louis and a supper on it.”
“How I should like to see all that,” cried he; “how beautiful it must be!”
D’Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss.
“Remember, this is no affair of mine,” said the trembling voice of La Carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below.
“You met on the same day you first saw me?”
Then he thought he was going to die.
“To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?”
“Yes, the very one who is lighting us.
This speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal.
Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the night.
There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a music-room for Julie, who never played.
“Oh, make yourself easy on that head,” replied Aramis.
One day he miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful.
God is always the last resource.
“Not from England, madame.
You know how much he loves me, my mother.
This apparition was so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with the exception of Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank calmly.
“Out, even to me?”
“And passes his time?”
“Are you hurt, sir?” coldly asked Morrel.
The porter was not yet gone to bed.
“De Wardes cannot boast of anything.”
You shall have as much again if you are back within six days, and have executed your commission well.”
“What do you decide on, sir?” asked the notary of Villefort.
As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.
De Winter bowed again, unable to reply from excess of emotion.
“Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure, and with which I am now going to take a ride to St. Germain.”
“I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to Dantès.
“Well,” said Felton, “till tonight.”
Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.
“‘Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.’
Everyone offered his own.
“Hear me, Athos,” said D’Artagnan.
In his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret thoughts, I find a relation to my own.
I am king of all creation.
“Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.
“The queen!”
Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand, but which evidently concerned him.
The bed, which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of fire.
Friquet, whose eye, ever on the alert, could alone have discovered them, had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre Dame.
She is called the fair Indian.”
“Then bring some wine,” said D’Artagnan.
Lord de Winter tore his hair.
The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.
“I accept.
Thrust it into my mouth, my lord, thrust it in.”
“Ah, devil take it, you speak in earnest——”
Dantès dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water.
The coachman, as we can well understand, made no resistance; in fact, he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man; D’Artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets.
Was it from London you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger?
I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete the precious pages.
“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.
Morcerf asked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen.
“There; do you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.”
That night, then, was somewhat riotous, as may be imagined.
At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters’ rent, and they threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was granted to him.
Lord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.
“And who is this cavalier, Henrietta?” asked the queen.
Let me conduct your business and my own.
There are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration.
D’Artagnan remained, therefore, alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting.
Terror recalled me to myself.
Anne of Austria lowered her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII.
Pierre obeyed.
Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentine’s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest.
Planchet called his master’s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty paces.
_Holà_, Mousqueton, seats, and order double the bottles!”
let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constable’s sword gilt for me.”
Planchet, much surprised at the inquiry, turned back.
The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain.
The coachman perceived at once, by the expression of the man who thus addressed him, that he had fallen into a trap, and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring.
“You are rich, then?” said Aramis.
“These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force,” said the Comte de la Fere.
“I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow.”
Albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped at intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.
At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many vultures in Adelmonte’s country); this bird darts on the dead fowl, and carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey.
“You know very well—the wine from the hills of Anjou.”
Well, I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in 1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal.”
The coast, owing to the Gascon’s stratagem, was clear.
“I can work, then?” said the voice.
as Mademoiselle de Scudery remarks.”
Either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis, and I will tolerate him, or he must never set his foot again in my house;—do you understand, madame?”
The gentlemen entered and remained standing, but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves.
“Here it is,” said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform.
“My lord the cardinal!
At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after.
Well, you have this excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I offer you—so much for the world.
“My arm and my life belong to you, like my love.”
Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt, and lace fell also over the top of his boots.
And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in, he opened it and disappeared behind it, shutting it as he went.
“You are good and faithful servants.”
If they ask it what have I to say?”
It is unnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did not suffer by the contrast.
D’Artagnan began to smile.
Notwithstanding his youth, Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy.
About a year ago, I talked of retiring to a convent.
“Which has happened to you?”
“Monsieur du Vallon, I commend his eminence to your care.”
It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style.”
“Your companion!” cried D’Artagnan, becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress.
“If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?” cried Milady; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes.
At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock.
“The thing is clear as day,” said he; “and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”
“Now, there is one,” said Kitty, “who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
50011m
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his garrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of La Prée.
“Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”
“He looks like a big-bug,” said another; “dresses in fine style.
All this is very sad which you tell me.”
At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance.
“Madame, if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow.
“It is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by this fellow,” continued the stranger.
His companions followed his example.
“Well?” said the queen, blinded by her obstinacy.
“I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I was, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.”
“He still doubts,” thought Milady; “I have not been earnest enough.”
In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil, near me, under my own eyes, within reach of my hand, the two most intractable ones.
“Thank you, thank you,” murmured she.
I swear to you, I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path.”
“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you.
“I will take charge of the inside one.
20157m
Only, in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to relate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession.
He had a heavy hand—dear old Athos—after drinking.”
But the count, disregarding his cry, continued to wring the bandit’s wrist, until, his arm being dislocated, he fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor.
“Try to spend it all.
“But you are not always travelling.”
“As I told you, monsieur,” replied Planchet, “Picards are found out by being used.
Have you brought your arms?”
“No,” repeated Noirtier; “No.”
Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word.
Seek quietude and oblivion, so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years.
“Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told you.”
“Ah!
She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your strength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.
27.” repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name.
I answered, ‘In Greece.’—‘Then,’ said he, ‘write to Yanina.’”
Aramis then joined Athos and D’Artagnan, who were consulting together.
“Really!”
“Do not fear.
All have forgiven me, some have even loved me; but I think that God has not pardoned me, for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that woman’s ghost rising before me.”
“It is not worthwhile to wait for that,” said Andrea; “money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.”
...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada
“And you did cry?” he asked.
I was afraid, not of a struggle, but of a failure.
“A bark!” all cried together.
He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants having, as we know, deserted the house.
Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman.
“After my reverend lord bishop,” said the king to the man, “I shall hear you with pleasure, sir.”
“Poor dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Kitty, in a voice full of compassion, and pressing anew the young man’s hand.
“Come, come!” said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, “do as I do.”

Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai Saint Michael, he raised his sword for them to double their speed.
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass.
This woman gave all the requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.”
“Poor Valentine!”
While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse, which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus, and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow.
“No drowsiness?”
A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.
Danglars asked for a knife and fork.
What injury has Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali Tepelini?”
Come, Porthos; come, Mousqueton.”
“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your fellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled?”
Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of D’Artagnan.
No.
Madame de Saintot has hastened to him with broth; La Renaudot warms his sheets; the Marquise de Rambouillet sends him his tisanes.”
“Yes; by a lackey named Lubin.”
“No, but I wish to have a share in my revenge.
“No, no!” said Milady.
Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together.
help!” cried a voice, whose mournful accents, reaching the four friends, seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean.
They were approaching the scene of war; and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras, they determined to remain in the town until the morrow.
“But he leaves his room, he plays at tennis at the Mall?”
Wait a week and I myself will give you some.”
“Decidedly, this is a clever fellow,” murmured Athos.
Well, he found us on his road and will not be baron this time.
Then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count’s chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated “dappled grays,” now changed into a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
The cardinal’s hair stood on end.
When the two were ready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim, and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to follow his master.
“But, pardon,” said D’Artagnan, with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man’s shoulder, “if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour, he has, of course, made that act of donation in writing.”
The monk’s eye again flashed, but that was all; he merely repeated his phrase, “I will go,”—and he went.
“By a miracle, monsieur, I must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my breast, and by nailing the Comte de Wardes on the byroad to Calais, like a butterfly on a tapestry.”
Caderousse paused.
If I were obliged to fight against you, I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through, for I never loved any one but you in the wide world;” and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Athos.
It was indeed Mousqueton—Mousqueton, as fat as a pig, rolling about with rude health, puffed out with good living, who, recognizing D’Artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin, slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off, so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun, which eclipsed the former luminary.
Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories.
“And the same love for you—eh, my dear child?”
“If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey?” said Athos.
They obeyed.
It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence.
“Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.”
“Hush!” said Grimaud, “he is coming out.
D’Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have excellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!”
“Ah, what a dreadful thing,” said the young musician; “who would have suspected it?
“And I, too,” murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes.
The Guests
“’Tis true!” thought the Gascon, “where has he heard it?
“And what have you been doing since yesterday?”
Speak one word, madame, and I take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy.”
“Yes, it is I.”
“Pooh!” said Porthos, “it is always that.
Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy.
If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.”
“Neither of them there!” she again said, as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her.
And if the suspicions of your Majesty, which I still continue to doubt, should prove to have any foundation, what a terrible disclosure, what a fearful scandal!”
“The notary, the notary!”
How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely the blue heavens and star-enameled sky!
This room was occupied by Dantès’ father.
Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son’s room, and inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed.
You had friends, Albert; break off their acquaintance.
The latter, sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea, and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day.
Did you ever hear of such an idea?”
“Ho!
“Caderousse shuddered.
At last a nightingale, lost in a thicket of shrubs, in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep.
Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded, and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand.
“His Eminence, then, orders me—” said the lady.
“Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de Saint-Méran has fallen a victim?”
An old proverb says, “Like master, like man.” Let us pass, then, from the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.
“It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and independent.”
I come to say that today, and for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at your disposal.
“Where?”
As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services.”
“Then you persist in continuing that thesis?”
“Oliver Cromwell.”
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.
They then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the hôtel of M. de Tréville.
The crowd, whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent, began to be tumultuous.
I command you not to stir—attempt nothing, not to let your countenance betray a thought, and I will send you tidings.
“Are you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?” cried Aramis, from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.
This mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions had been put to him.
“Then who are you?”
“In his convent!
Perhaps some day they will want to make you king, instead of the Prince of Wales, or the Duke of York, your elder brothers.
On this occasion he began his rounds at Dantès’ cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria’s dungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen.
“Your profession?”
They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear, as they lay bound in the chamber.
The duke exchanged a signal with them.
“Mount, my lord,” said D’Artagnan to Mazarin, who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding.
They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming.
“Now that I have the word of Athos I can set out.”
“Oh, second father,” he exclaimed, “thou who hast given me liberty, knowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to ourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,—then, noble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me some sign, some revelation!
The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey furnished by Porthos.
“Without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,” returned Franz, “I cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.”
He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him.
“I will, then.
The young man’s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to d’Avrigny.
“Just so.
gentlemen,” said Aramis, “decidedly it is a night for meetings.
“Rise,” said the count, “your life is safe; the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices—one is mad, the other dead.
“I understand,” said Athos; “but why not Porthos?
“Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.”
“I not only promise, but swear it!” said Monte Cristo extending his hand.
He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside.
“A great favor!
The count came towards him.
Marvelous!

“Calm yourself, my dear child, and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors.”
Athos made a sign to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was.
Sometimes he weeps bitterly, sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes ‘duck-and-drake’ five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz.
“You know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.”
Then, after a moment of reverie, he remembered where he had left D’Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything.
Mazarin shuddered, but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first.
He arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation.
Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken.
“Ah!
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and lay down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!”
D’Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.”
The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising.”
Men are so made; and we are not always twenty years old.
To-day the third will be there also.”
“Monsieur Laporte,” said D’Artagnan, “finish dressing his majesty.”
“It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,” returned the Englishman.
“Let your Majesty remember,” said Tréville, “that Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously.
“A man wishes to see Monsieur at home,” replied Bazin.
“By the Corsinari?”
D’Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.
Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, “She will arrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money.
Come, I am a good sort of a prince,’ added he, ‘and although I like not Puritans I do them justice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are pretty.
The boat at this moment turned around, and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos.
“Listen, my dear, my adored Valentine,” said he in his melodious and grave tone; “those who, like us, have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world, such may read each other’s hearts.
30325m
I do not reproach you, Athos, for what you have done.
D’Artagnan, remember this!
At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced.
The Place Royale.
They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning, namely, in the direction toward Scotland.
I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings; but after all, as I have given you proofs, my dear cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs, and I will take charge of the commission.
“My lord,” he said, “will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject, which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty?”
When he had finished, he went to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses.
“Free to leave me.”
“That is it,” replied the cardinal, dryly.
I am myself a Frenchman.
“To no one, on my honor.”
Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.”
What would you do, tell me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?”
“He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting-maid—poor Kitty!
“Yes!
“You have evidently seen and observed everything.”
“Brave young man!” murmured the king.
On seeing D’Artagnan rise, Porthos rose also; these four men were therefore all standing at the same time, with a menacing aspect, opposite to each other.
I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal.”
Cambalet, his niece; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke—all things which appeared to D’Artagnan monstrous impossibilities.
“‘That will teach me,’ he said, ‘to have my guards provided with better horses; for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend, you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive.’”
“Oh, their heads are soon cut off,” said Danglars.
these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon; well, Monsieur de Montbazon is the husband of Madame de Montbazon——”
Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme.
“Let your servants guard them.”
Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert.
“Gate!” cried she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the window.
“I believe so,” replied Aramis.
“Do not speak to me of that,” said Monte Cristo, with the first movement of anger he had betrayed; “I will make him suffer.”
The more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed, the more degrading is her fall.
“What?”
Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the distance that separated them.
“Ah!” said Aramis, “but you forget the officer.”
“To your health!” repeated Porthos and Aramis.
Hearing the name of Morrel, who had left him only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose, and sprang to meet him.
“From the Comte de la Fere,” said Aramis.
“Did the people shout at all?” Cromwell asked.
He fancied, also, that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention.
The Carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes, expectations, and claims to notice.
“Fernand Mondego.”
“Yes, yes!
Having given various orders to Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the attentive Nubian:
Athos and Aramis took their leave, but even in the ante-chamber they could still hear the duke’s cries; he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned.
“Oh!” said Porthos.
Is it not a curious affair?”
“Yonder is the house, Porthos,” said the Gascon; “let me do what I please and do you what I do.”
One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:
“He is a musician.”
The cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near.
Do you understand, father?
“So I am of these men; but there is another over me.”
He dreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its truth;—he cared little for that _mene, mene, tekel upharsin_, which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;—but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them.
“Ah,” replied he, sighing, “that is not very surprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a provincial.
I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.”
Now, is that all?”
mon Dieu!
I stand in need of being taught and consoled.”
Oh, traitors that ye are!”
“The Bible,” said Aramis, “makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of Samuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos.”
“Yes, surely, he came with the prince; a charming young man; he is one of your friends then, monsieur le comte?”
The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise.
“It is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor.” Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, “You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres?”
“Why do you like that best?”
“Yes,” said Grimaud, with his hair standing on end.
‘What do you say?’ asked his wife, pale as death.
And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode.
“I am told it is a delightful place?”
“I think I may aspire to that honor,” said Danglars with a smile, which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins.
M. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects another.
“Is it my equipment?”
I imitate neither Manfred nor Anthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has entwined itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing so,—I repeat it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life.
“Why did she not let me know sooner?”
“How so, if he loved her?” asked D’Artagnan.
Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin!”
Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:
I think, rather than give pain to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.”
You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you can go away in your turn.”
Has Monsieur Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?
“As you please, sir,” said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and kitchen.
“But that will compromise me sadly, you know.”
I cannot endure the modern school of painting.”
“What are you doing?”
“Silence!” cried Felton; “we are here.”
Strength and Sagacity—Continued.
Beware, my dear D’Artagnan!
“I have never seen anyone I preferred to you, and I have never loved anyone but you and my father.”
“Well, he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head.
“As soon as possible.”
“Cut the cable, then.”
I beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too Italian, or too Arabian.
“This wound, my dear D’Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.”
If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith.
“Well, what does the queen believe?”
Aramis discharged his bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set forward to join Porthos.
“Oh, fear nothing, madame!” said the young woman, clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen’s sorrows; “I am your Majesty’s, body and soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your Majesty from your trouble.”
“I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world.”
“You can tell him, sir,” answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle-field, “that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men; of fighting man to man, without discomfiture, against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d’Herblay, and of surrendering only to fifty men!
“‘Eh, _pardieu!_ Joannes, the jeweller.’
And why presently?
“Poor D’Artagnan’” said Athos, with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character, “so brave, so good, so terrible to the enemies of those he loves.
“I don’t remember him.”
“Very good,” said the queen, “be as grateful as you like, it does not implicate me; you are here safe and sound, that is all I wished for; you are not only welcome, but welcome back.”
D’Artagnan came the next day to Milady’s, and finding her in a very ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes that provoked her thus.
“And I,” said the coadjutor, “want it to be thought that I do not speak to him.
But should you find the means of retaining them, remember, my lord, that I shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen; and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children.”
At the same time D’Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his hand.
You may be overheard.”
“‘What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an exception?’
Chapter 30.
And Peppino placed his pan on the ground, so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Danglars.
“He is an admirable man,” said the major; “and he sent them to you?”
There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls.
“Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.”
A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca, St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son.
It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the circular rock.
She wouldn’t believe me, saying that she knew Anne of Austria, who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb.
“Calm yourself, my friend,” said the count, with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling; “I am not an inspector, but a traveller, brought here by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to lose your time.”
“Ah, I shall know how to make you leave your home!” replied Albert, clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove, which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of.
“No, it is not worth while.”
No signature.
These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine’s death had struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the flower of her youth.
Yes, Albert, from whatever source the blow may have proceeded—it may be from an enemy, but that enemy is only the agent of Providence.”
Only take care that I am not seen through the wicket.”
Answer me!”
But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of the count’s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English.
Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis; then she picked up Friquet.
Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal, and presented it to the duke without a word.
“What has he done, madame?” said D’Artagnan.
“In that case,” commanded Comminges, “silence that old woman.”
“‘Nevertheless,’ replied the jeweller, ‘if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another start.’
“What a horrible face that monk has,” said De Guiche.
The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother, approached Valentine and took her hand.
“Monsieur le marechal,” said the queen, after a moment’s reflection, “go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me.”
“Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,” said Albert; “your punctuality really alarms me.
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table alone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.
“Oh, today, I am no further than gratitude.”
“Nothing for the present; at least, nothing in good earnest.”
Thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it, M. de Tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword, and was so faithful to his motto, that Louis XIII., one of the good blades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight, he would advise him to choose as a second, himself first, and Tréville next—or even, perhaps, before himself.
“Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.
“Why do you not join our party, my dear Beauchamp?
“Andrea?”
“They are binding her; they are going to drag her away,” cried D’Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor.
“Certainly.
Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness.
Chapter LII.
who are you, in the first place, to ask me to take a turn with you?”
“But,” said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host’s meditations, “you had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know what it was?”
“Come, come, calm yourself.
And do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment, and if this priest wished it, in an hour you would be without a crown?
“Willingly,” said Aramis.
At the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count, Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess, and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man; he no longer doubted that the daughter of King Charles I. loved his friend.
The friends urged on their horses and arrived, in fact, at about five o’clock in the morning.
“Mademoiselle,” said he, “you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother’s room, will you allow me the honor of a few minutes’ conversation with M. Noirtier?”
“Then it is because you do not know your friends, my dear Monsieur Louvieres,” said the coadjutor, raising his hat.
“None at all.”
The bare idea would kill me—would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger-nails!
“My father has revealed the culprit’s name; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret.
When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he made no opposition.
“In that case, take care!
Unfortunately, he is more nimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us all under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for, he takes all he wants without asking at all.”
They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king’s arrival.
“They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting.”
One instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor—his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder.
“The one that is most in use just at this time.”
There is your money,—half in bank-notes, the other half in checks payable to bearer.
Each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they still felt that they would not like to be absent.
“I thought that Madame was ill, and I wished to bring her help,” responded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress’s face.
“And a magnificent one!” cried the host.
Imagine to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected, even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely chiseled.
“Monsieur jests, but Monsieur will see.”
“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”
“That, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself.”
“Hem,” said Danglars.
[29] The Carolina—not Virginia—jessamine, _gelsemium sempervirens_ (properly speaking not a jessamine at all) has yellow blossoms.
Is it as hopeless as he thinks?”
“I do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce that sentence, which would not be orthodox.”
I regret not having heard them.
“Yes, without doubt, it is necessary,” cried the queen; “but how am I to act?
Mistrust everything, in short, even your own shadow.”
“And before you went to the Bastile?”
He resolved to adopt the second, and began that day to carry out his resolve.
May I ask what you were doing there?”
A horse for Planchet, that’s all.
“No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a rendezvous.”
As you say, Mazarin is a knave.
I have the purse still by me—a large one, made of red silk.”
We ought to die together.
“In Paris?”
As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the table beneath the window.
“Rue de la Fontaine!” exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; “at what number?”
At two o’clock the tennis balls began, according to Grimaud’s directions, to take the direction of the moat, much to the joy of La Ramee, who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat; and very soon balls were wanting, so many had gone over.
“And that is but just,” said Athos, and he took aside the one of the four Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in a low voice.
“Excuse me, sir,” replied the notary; “on the contrary, the meaning of M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind.”
At these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son’s arms.
“Not in the least.”
Ay, that will do—at Armentières.”
“That I had none as yet; but that I was to dine to-day with two gentlemen, who would be able to give me some.”

“Yes, yes, yes,” said the old man’s eye.
Felton uttered a groan.
They found him holding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Tréville’s note in the other.

“Beat the messenger!” cried Porthos.
“For you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine, and the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to Athos.”

Here was another frondeuse to persuade, and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival.
He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy.
“But as to free will, Aramis?”
Porthos was perfectly indifferent; Athos, pale, but resolute; Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow.

With a man like you I fear nothing.”

“Well, if you know them, you know that they are good and free companions.
“Ah, how good my dear father is!”
“She will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.”

At half-past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour.

“I have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen—two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.”
“This instant, duke!
“I am in the hands of my enemies,” continued she, with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans.
“Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to summon assistance for you.”
They parted.
“Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!” exclaimed Andrea; “you speak to me before my servant.”
The idea of resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never occurred to her.

“Ah, count,” she exclaimed, with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Meslay.
“And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?” asked Cavalcanti.
I embrace you with all my heart.
The young man did not wait to be told twice, but passing under the horse’s head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud.
Now my work is accomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure.
and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?”
Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation, took his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of the room.
“Do you wish to see him?”
What do you say to this, mother?”
“A fine thing, indeed!” grunted Porthos.
Say the devil!”
The guide held the door open.
“Faults or crimes,” responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.
Andrea made no resistance, although he protested against it.
Ah, I confess, your excellency, when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle, I felt my eyes filled with tears.
“The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you, sire.”
Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school.
“I certainly never will get drunk again, D’Artagnan; it is too bad a habit.”
Come, father” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor Caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”
He no longer feared realities, but phantoms.
“Well, he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris, an invalid, ordered country air for his health.”
The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was Carlini.
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, “you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I beg of you.”

“And so Mademoiselle Danglars——”
The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene.
But D’Artagnan was still in a desponding mood.
I swear to you, I protest—”
“Come,” said he, “this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing, you know.
The young man, prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings, which were mournful, and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through, descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king, who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there; and who appeared to abide on that spot, that he might thus address human pride, so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne: “Dust of the earth!
Speak; I will listen.”
“Dec.
M. de Tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first place, and the friends of the king—and then for himself and his own friends.
“Luigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the grotto.
D’Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter; it was dated from the Chateau du Vallon.
Pay no attention to it; you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy.”
I then resolved to go up to him at all risks.
“Why, it is indeed a true royal jewel, which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier.
One of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the honor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly—my wife, then, came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears.”
Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chaussée d’Antin.

“You seem secretly elated.”
All that, however, has nothing to do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in my own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you?
Louis XIII.
“But what say you to Raoul’s fancy?”
“Not at all; it interests me very much,” cried D’Artagnan; “and at this moment I have absolutely nothing to do.”
Tell me what I am to do for this.”
“Never, never!”
Ah!
Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted a quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.
The young girl smiled.
see how regularly I live and how easy I am here.
“‘What was the abbé’s name?’ asked the indefatigable questioner.
Morrel followed him, and looked also for his sister and brother in-law; he soon discovered them in another box, and kissed his hand to them.
“De Bruy!” cried the friends, “’tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening,” said Aramis, “so we give it up.”
We bet upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half.
At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and D’Artagnan turned to him.

“The doctor?”
Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you any landed property?”
The duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax, even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms.
“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.
Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger.”

“I registered their deed of gift yesterday.”
“You are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to do; it is with Madame.”
“Oh, women!
They both stood in amazement at the door.
You must return to the Rue des Fossoyeurs; I will accompany you.”
no,” said Bonacieux, “but yesterday I went to St. Mandé to make some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without one; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which I have not yet had time to remove.”

“No, sir, I assure you,” muttered Raoul, “it is not.”
Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a bait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises—I must do her that justice.
“At least you don’t speak well of him.”
Just then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the crowd, who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics.
She had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to this decision, Mme.

I shall buy a chestnut-colored suit.
“Really, monsieur,” said Madame de Chevreuse, “unless you are the devil in person I don’t know how you could become acquainted with all these details.”
Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.
“Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, I may say what would appear absurd to another.”

“So!
Have you provided yourself with money?
Let us load the guns.”
“I will assist your memory, madame,” continued the count; “the day had been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in consequence of the festival.
If you could but persuade him to come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life; I should adore you as my patron saint!”
At a quarter to six o’clock, Monsieur de Gondy, having finished his business, returned to the archiepiscopal palace.

You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect those deeds.”
“I believe so,” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness.
The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property?

The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.
“To think of the Parisians,” soliloquized D’Artagnan, “offering only the other day, by an edict of the parliament, six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them, dead or alive—if alive, in order to hang him; if dead, to deny him the rites of Christian burial!”
“But,” said he whom D’Artagnan thus provoked, “it appears to me that this place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the Abbey St. Germain or in the Pré-aux-Clercs.”
It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Medusa.
However, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing.
While Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune, D’Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged to stop at Crèvecœur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, D’Artagnan, had been forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to reach England.
Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand across his forehead, entered his study.
“There, Duke,” said he, “you were right and I was wrong.

Albert was used to the count’s manner of proceeding; he knew that, like Nero, he was in search of the impossible, and nothing astonished him, but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count’s orders had been executed, he accompanied him to the door of the house.
Pardon my frankness, dear friend.
“Then he is here?”
“Never mind, we shall see!
“And this is all?” said she; “and you stopped there?”
He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and a little too thick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with white, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will, might have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble one.

The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire before they attacked.”
“Monsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running—_me_, you understand?”
“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”
Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond; you are thinking, I am sure, of some kind speech to console me, but do not utter it to me, reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness.
“Good God!” cried he, laughing, “I quite despair of my poor Michon; she will never write like Monsieur de Voiture.”
It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between Albert and the fair peasant continued all day.
Are you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter?
The matter was no longer doubtful.
“Yes,” returned the duke, “I must confess I sometimes think of it.”
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated upon a stool near a dying fire.
“Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch?”
“Oh,” said Andrea philosophically, determined to watch his companion narrowly, “does not life pass in waiting?
“_Pardieu!_” cried D’Artagnan, “you could not have arrived in better time; the dinner cannot have had time to get cold!
“I swear to you, you shall receive the consolation that you ask.
No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child, and yet he sleeps.”
And what does it amount to, after all?

Andrea had fled.
Afterward, Monsieur de Tréville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris, five times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of age, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date up to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps!

“‘Well, then, so I will!’ said Caderousse; ‘so you may have the diamond for 45,000 francs.

The handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it.

The door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known to all.
The result of these reflections was that D’Artagnan, without asking information of any kind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible—a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.
“Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.”
“Bah!
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres.
“’Tis settled,” said Aramis; “at the cry ‘Jesus Seigneur’ we go out, upset all that stands in our way, run to our horses, jump into our saddles, spur them; is that all?”
“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.
May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you?”

“Oh, my Lord!” cried the baron, “I shall never console myself.”
The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight.
“Now,” said she, “listen to me.”
Oh, you do not understand me!
“And then?”
A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.
Giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord—for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord—he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness D’Artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible.
“And you know,” said Aramis, “that it was our friend Mordaunt who made, if not the bargain, at least the overtures.”
Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good.
“The devil, gentlemen!” said the cardinal, “three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble!
Be silent, dear Du Vallon, and resign yourself.”
The man was an enigma to Franz.
Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened; his face was like marble, and his heart was like bronze.
“Now,” said Athos, “sleep, or try to sleep, my friends, and I will watch.”
“It is only to poets that such things happen,” said Athos, gravely.
“Ah,” said Milady, with a sigh, “if she loves she is not altogether wretched.”
“Sir,” said Broussel, “I am in bad health and cannot give myself up a prisoner in this state; I must have time.”
This was Groslow.
“Yes.”
No; a more material interest stirred his blood.
Then he added in Spanish, “Anne, are you mad?
“Now,” he said, “are you in pain?”
Remember, it is you who have ruined me!”
Stay!—stay!—How strange that it should not have occurred to me before!

“Nevertheless,” replied Mordaunt, “I could compel you; I command here.”
Milady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of herself.
that was the question.
But the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss.”
You allow me to give you this title?” continued the count in French, “it is necessary to excite this man’s confidence.”
“Poor queen!” murmured Athos.
“You?
“Never, monseigneur; I waited at the door.”
“By my father’s tomb,” said he, extending his hand over the head of the young girl, “I swear to you, Haydée, that if any misfortune happens, it will not be to me.”

The Accusation
Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted, sirs.
Now you talk, my dear.”
’tis not civil war that disunites us.
There was a secret communication between the cardinal’s apartments and those of the queen; and through this corridor* Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of Austria.
She opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity.
The door opened, and Monte Cristo, turning round, saw Albert, pale and trembling, followed by Beauchamp and Château-Renaud.
“Yes, doubtless,” replied D’Artagnan, who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair, “yes, doubtless there is one.”
“Go along this corridor, down a little staircase, and you are in it.”
“Oh, oh!” he at length muttered, “do you see?”
“Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he slowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live.”
“He must be about twenty-three years of age,” said Athos, in a low tone.
It was the cannon which announced the closing of the port.
His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel.
I rely much on external impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies.”
“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future.
“Well, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?”
“Nay, dear mother, say the accused person.
“Why,” said Danglars, “in the letter—I believe I have it about me”—here he felt in his breast-pocket—“yes, here it is.
France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful.
I remember too well.
“Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening.”
At half-past six the duke arose and said very gravely:
“But,” continued the queen, “you have doubtless come for some important purpose.
He gained a village, knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France.
“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen months in all.

‘Well, then, a good journey to you,’ said Caderousse.

Thanks, Guitant; I shall benefit by your advice this very evening.”
“I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,” said Madame Danglars, whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment.
“I have the power of so doing,” said Monte Cristo.
In exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four, and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.
And here is Mr. Mordaunt, who has brought it and is charged with its execution.”
Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde; and Mazarin, in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach, had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving.

The whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world.
Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint.

Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these matters, he would have been surprised at the king’s procureur answering him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department.
“Then I will not leave you.”
Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet.
In the shadow was a carriage with two horses, and some saddlehorses.
“Let us see your idea, Aramis,” said Athos, who felt much deference for the young Musketeer.
Come and converse with us for just five minutes, sword in hand, upon this deserted terrace.”
He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as if by enchantment.
“He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and bank-notes.
“I was saying it was very interesting.”

“Come,” said Mazarin, conducting D’Artagnan into the queen’s oratory and desiring him to wait there.
Now, then, let us breakfast.”
“Yes.”
“Why not?”

His quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still remained at the window.
And D’Artagnan coughed.
Groslow, whom D’Artagnan’s praises had greatly pleased, welcomed him with a gracious smile.
“Just so.
Dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart.
“And are the first of men!” added D’Artagnan.
“Come, count,” said Raoul, who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the Augustine; “come, I feel ill here,” and the two young men spurred on.
The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St. Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without livery had waiting for them.
You know or you don’t know, that that is what we ask of you.”
“The prisoners!” he exclaimed, jumping off his horse.
He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_, the only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.
And instantly, Grimaud, sitting upon the board as if on horseback, commenced his perilous descent.
“He was in the country, as I was told by the person who recommended him to me.”
Now, I repeat, Beauchamp, I wish to return to human and material existence, and if you are still the friend you profess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the blow.”
“I think I shall send him to Paris.”
“Still,” persisted Franz, “I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person.
“Comrade,” said he, “I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell me where we are going.
But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said:
Sit down, and I will read it again.”
“You are looking for my daughter?” said the baroness, smiling.
“I?
The cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince.
I wished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused their office.
“By whom?”
D’Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach.
Athos cast a glance at his feet, hands and hair—those three marks of race.
I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived.
“Well, sir,” said Morrel, sinking into a chair, “you have heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.”
I have only two adversaries—I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I subdue even them,—they are time and distance.
Take it, then, but in exchange——”
You are included in the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms.
These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation.
The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend.
“That has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women,” said Athos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count.
Bonacieux, “he will rouse the whole quarter.”
But D’Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried, “Wait!”
Are you no longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?”
“No, indeed!”
“What orders?” asked Milady.
But marrying, as I am about to do, before all Paris, I ought to be supported by an illustrious name, and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar; now, my father is not coming to Paris, is he?”
Well, all that was useless.
“Yes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.”
I remained in the room and waited.”
He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her.
“How does that concern you?” replied the Swiss.

“I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion.
“To return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves London.”
Edmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and joy.
“Acknowledge, then, you stony heart,” said D’Artagnan, “that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts.”
“A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards, who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter.”
“And now,” at last said the queen, “now that we are alone, repeat your counsel, monsieur le coadjuteur.”
Be it understood we are speaking of Athos.
“We are going with a mission to Her Majesty, the Queen of England.”
He was spoken of as the most adroit, the strongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around; and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa.
Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard.
“Ah!” said Mordaunt, with a sneer, “there’s one who is afraid.”
D’Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.
Cries were heard from the camp, “Come down!
D’Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder, and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast, the conversation ended there.
The dark space frightened her.
I have seen you, and invited you without any ceremony, when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept, as you were going to Tréport.”
This person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with flowers.
What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous?
During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance.
“It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o’clock this evening?”
“The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.”
As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped, as if guessing that he was the man they wanted.
“Yes, sire, I hear,” stammered the queen.
“No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell you all, for the Abbé Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret; but, I pray you, go away from that plane-tree.
And he wiped his eyes, still moist.
D’Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer’s pretty wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her off, and that she had promised him nothing.
“Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself?”
D’Artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger; with dilated eyes, growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant’s offices.
“Oh!” exclaimed Morrel.
“Take Mousqueton.”
“You are sure of your enterprise?”
“Not the least in the world,” replied Bonacieux.
Athos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, D’Artagnan saw that he became pale.
“No, no, madame,” said Felton, “only do not sing so loud, particularly at night.”
“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation.
And Porthos heaved another sigh.
He cannot acknowledge me openly, it appears, but he does it through M. Cavalcanti, and gives him fifty thousand francs for it.”
To the boat!
Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first time you had ever met?
“I wish to receive her majesty’s commands from her own lips.”
“Madame,” faltered D’Artagnan, “’tis twenty years ago—I have a good memory—since I had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the Hotel de Ville, of kissing one of those lovely hands.”
“You have an answer ready for everything,” replied the queen, and she took from her bureau a document, which she filled up and signed.
“Why, it is poor Lubin, the lackey of the Comte de Wardes—he whom you took such good care of a month ago at Calais, on the road to the governor’s country house!”
“Your eminence,” he said, “might have dispensed with your attendants; the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it.”
Anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it.
And remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them with his hand, and rode away.
“The messenger did not say.”
It however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as D’Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion, Aramis said, “you see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas.”
“Here, sir,” said a voice behind him.
“Well, and what are you going to do at St. Germain?” then demanded Athos.
“But let me see, how was it done?
“Rochefort,” said the cardinal, “you see Monsieur d’Artagnan.
Then, disguised in the clothes of the Marquis d’O——, he had left the hotel, stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door.
“Listen: there were in truth, at that epoch, four devoted hearts, four loyal spirits, four faithful swords, who saved more than my life—my honor——”
Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is, that I will kill you.
Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in which were the servants’ apartments.
The king advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and his Highness Monsieur with the queen.
ah!
Come, now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past.”
“Wait, it ought to be there in my pocket; it speaks of his return, does it not, Porthos?”
It was indeed Aramis.
“Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five millions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have hesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently sustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather shaken.
“There, in the salon.
Shall further inquiries be made?
“Oh, mother!” murmured Renée.
She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic.
Once arrived at the brink of the river, should we even find them three ranks deep, as long as you and your regiment do your duty, we will look to the rest.”
Eugénie looked at Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed.
“The devil!
La Chesnaye, go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles; and if you can find them, bring them to me.
“Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.”
He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke.
“And the best hack?”
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes.
Now, not a second to lose, for a second lost will perhaps save them.
“Adieu, brother!” cried Milady.
“None, monsieur.”
In the first one handy, provided it is safe,” said the commissary, with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with horror.
“Does the House approve that the examination should take place today?”

As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him.
“I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.”
Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hôtel des Gardes.
“Alas!” he said to himself, “if I only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church, whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life, all the littlenesses of greatness, perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul.
“So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,” added he, turning to Renée, “judge for yourself if it be not important.”
“A thousand pistoles, perhaps.”
“And, sir,” continued the wounded man, “I suffer much and would like, if possible, to be carried to some house.”
“What’s the matter?” cried Mordaunt, who, coming up out of the hatchway, rushed to the stern, waving his torch.
“No,” replied Madame Danglars, “I am too ill.”
He therefore looked forward to six o’clock with as much impatience as the duke himself.
Edmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came.
“Faith!
Empty your pockets.”
“Are you mad, La Ramee?
Chapter LIII.

Money!
At ten o’clock Athos, with his habitual exactitude, was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter.
“She went to the Palais,” replied the steward.
Then, lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves.
This will be,” added Noirtier, with a smile, “one means by which you may a second time save me, if the political balance should some day take another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down.
“Listen, then, Lord Winter.
I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested, but despised—of a man capable of anything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do.”
He made fruitless efforts to go on; it was impossible.
“I confess,” observed Monte Cristo, “that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful.”

Milady was there, as it were, where you sit.” (Athos changed color.)
“It is not your fault, my good Ali,” said the count in the Arabic language, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing, either in voice or face—“it is not your fault.
Milady had, likewise, the best of passports—her beauty, her noble appearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.
A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the other half of the napkin.
“Has he wit or not—this demon D’Artagnan?” said Porthos, astonished at his friend’s deception.

“Now go,” returned Franz, “or I shall go myself and bargain with your _affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.”
Haydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same time some imperceptible sign, murmured:
This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still as much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first day of their wedding.”
He left there three men.
Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds, which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls.
I followed him thither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by the gate you see there.”

He looked at D’Artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles, of which children are so proud when they receive them.
“Write that name on a bit of paper, lest I should forget it.
“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that you die.’ but it was a legate _à latere_, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with him.’

My first duty, directly I had succeeded in recalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in order to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would, in all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to life, partly on my sister’s account, and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance.
At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up.
He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia.

“I disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,” continued D’Artagnan, “for by what I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen.”

“We are invited,” replied D’Artagnan, “to pass the night with M. Groslow.
“And besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,” said Porthos.
D’Artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man, who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis, but whose lies were bold and decided.
Franz and Albert were opposite the Via delle Muratte; the coachman, without saying a word, drove up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli Palace and stopped at the door of the hotel.
“You are right, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, my friends and I have been on a little journey.”
“‘Yes,’ replied Teresa with astonishment; ‘but I was mad to utter such a wish.’

M. d’Avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death.
“Ah, is it you, count?” said the young man, in an almost joyful accent, pressing Monte Cristo’s hand with both his own.
Although the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that wild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and those bleeding lips.
Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and preceded by the sentinel.
I should injure the queen instead of serving her.”
“No, of you.”
The Riot.
Now, I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you, from the bottom of my heart.”
“Bah,” said Debray; “he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you said so yourself.”
“Ah, the traitor!” and he disappeared.
“My Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I demand her liberty of you.”
“You do not, madame; at least, I hope not.
“Answer, then.
“It is for you,” replied a gendarme.
D’Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king’s Musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he was considered beforehand as a comrade.
“Here,” said Milady, rising with the majesty of a queen, “here, Felton, behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl, the victim of the brutality of a villain.
Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration, even honor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn you to infamy.’
Nevertheless, one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out, his charcoal all removed, taken away; and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed.
“Do you think the thing possible?”
“That,” said Athos, “would be quite another thing; and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic.”
In the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.
A cold perspiration burst out on Villefort’s brow; his legs trembled, and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch.
“Well, well,” said Monte Cristo, “such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king’s attorney at that!
It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful, and the blow was so great he rushed out, overcome, and forgot to shut the door.
“A hundred louis.”
Will that do?”
A PROCURATOR’S DINNER
“The friend of Madame de Villefort!
“And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight?”
You were walking one evening in M. de Villefort’s garden; from what you relate, I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death.
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE Chapter IX.
“God?
We should presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind confidence in each other’s prudence.”
I sounded all the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound.
Grimaud entered.
God will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest.
“Those at the side?”
“I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted.”
there was no great cunning necessary.
Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this secret?”
“And are you going there?”
He knew what were the rights of the great land owners.
“Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets.
He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie; there the aspect changed; here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop; their doors seemed closed like their shutters, but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men, who seemed fearful of showing what they carried, to enter, closing immediately.
But he did not succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened.
He resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de Rochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to London.
“I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?”
Aramis smiled; his smile was at once cunning and resolute.
“Now then, Albert,” cried Franz, “here is a bandit for you at last.”
It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin.
“No,” said D’Artagnan, “it is in advance.”
“I am from Gascony, it is true; and since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons are not very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once, were it even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done.”
Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, “What makes you suppose so?”
“Yes, monsieur, we are cousins,” said Porthos, without being disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband.
Nevertheless,” he continued, in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice, “I think it is better not to make them.”

‘Proceed,’ was heard on all sides.
I have weighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms; something must have happened.”
“‘But how did he obtain it?’ asked the jeweller; ‘had he it before he was imprisoned?’
“Yes.”
“I was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, _pardieu_, I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each.
“I believe you,” said Mme.
“Here is one,” he said.
Danglars bent his head, which he meant to imply, “Very well.” The carriage again moved on.
You see I am more candid than you.”’”
This fawn-colored hair, or, perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women, gave her the name of “La Lionne.” Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat, but before sitting down, she cast, in all her queen-like grandeur, a look around the room, and her eyes rested on Raoul.
“Monsieur Scarron, do me the honor,” said Raoul, blushing, “to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company.”
“What is it?”
“When I am convinced that the statement is false.”
“Nothing.”
Knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by?”
The procurator, seeing he was going, invited him to dinner—an invitation which the Musketeer refused with a majestic air.
But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes.
“Well, it surpasses that.”
“M.
“Was he in the wars?”
But all three reflected upon the youth of D’Artagnan, and dreaded his inexperience.
“Gad, I should be very happy, but I have my companion, Monsieur du Vallon, and the two prisoners, whom I cannot leave.
under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to doing a good action.
Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell.
“I say, sire, that there is now but one way open.
“Rochefort—you remember him?”
“I believe you, monsieur, I believe you; and as I was about to say, by the word of Bonacieux, I have confidence in you.”
You shall see.” And Dame Nanette sprang to the window, threw it open, and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame:

A draught of wine, D’Artagnan.”
In the struggle her clothes caught fire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate.
“What is it?”
“Is what you tell me true?” asked the wounded man.
“Everything.”
“I will do it with all my heart,” said Comminges; “for I know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty; I know, too, how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested.
“Am I not to know to whom to present it?”
Then D’Artagnan became almost wild.
Besides, D’Artagnan from her own admission knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could entertain no respect for her.
As for myself, I can assure you of one thing,—the more men you see die, the easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a torture, but it is not an expiation.”
Why should I risk an imprudent step?
“I am always curious to see the downfall of your honor’s enemies, and he was not among the least of them.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” murmured Raoul.
At this time Athos came up to D’Artagnan.
She could scarcely believe in her happiness; and D’Artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written.
Aramis had discovered the idea, _the lackeys_.
Chapter LXXV.
Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings.
The host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.
“What, Milady!
The Island of Monte Cristo Chapter 24.
“Go thither, and if there be none—well, well,” continued Louis XVIII., “make one; that is the usual way, is it not?” and the king laughed facetiously.
“Εἰπέ—speak.”
Do you understand it now?”
“What is the matter?
“We have a fixed price for all our provisions.
D’Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment.
“Make your mind easy, he is in good hands.”
It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within—a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.
“No,” said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, “no, a hundred times no!”
“In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, “Let go!”
At the third knock, however, steps were heard inside.
“I did.

Groslow advanced to the door of the king’s room, replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests, looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple, yet touching scene, then turning to D’Artagnan, assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved.
Scarcely had D’Artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca, which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night.
Bertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did not let fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered countenance.
They seemed to understand each other so well,” said Monte Cristo with renewed energy.
Do you want any money?”
They passed through a courtyard as they went, full of soldiers and courtiers.
Noirtier made a sign that it did.
“Let us understand each other, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan, “and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake.
Unfortunately, No.
What undertaking can have brought him to Paris?
“Certainly, my dear sir.”
“Port wine.”
I am not allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me.
Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count’s room, and in ten minutes all will be settled.”
“I hope it may be so,” replied Caderousse, his face flushed with cupidity.
A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.
“Oh, death, death!” said she, lowering her voice and her eyelids, “oh, death, rather than shame!
“It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not to break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence.
“You wish me to get out at that window?”
You who have chateau, meadows, mountains, woods—you who have forty thousand francs a year—you—are—not—happy?”
On the sixth day, the smugglers returned.
“Well, sir, go,” said Louis XVIII., “and remember that I am waiting for you.”
If the four friends were assembled at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the conversation.
One was perfectly charming, delicate, pensive, shaded by beautiful dark hair, and eyes soft as velvet, like those lovely flowers, the heartsease, in which shine out the golden petals.
“It is a bad year for kings,” said Gondy, shaking his head; “look at England, madame.”
A half hour afterward, D’Artagnan returned with the two thousand livres, and without having met with any accident.
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.
“Thank you, sir,” answered the young man, much moved.
“Yes,” said Aramis, “but that one word is the name of some town or village.”
“On the honor of a Rochefort; but you must do the like for me.”
He then took Villefort’s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest.
“And,” said the prisoner, “what talk is there of war with Spain?”
“Do you think so, sir?
Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.
“And who is that other person?” asked Milady, warmly.
“Because I happened to be in the ante-chamber when the cardinal called me, by the merest chance.
Chapter 115.
The one seemed to be deprived of reason, yet he was meditating.

Mme.
Do you understand?”

I opened my eyes, astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt; a third of the squadron were lying on the ground, wounded, dead or dying.
“You mean the Colosseum?”
“Where shall we escort him?”
“Of what?”
“You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large the sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman.
Listen, sir.
Porthos bowed to his friend.
“Ah,” said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, “is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?”
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the left, galloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch, and, issuing from the Rue de la Michodière, he arrived at M. Danglars’ door just at the same time that Villefort’s landau, after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, stopped to leave the baroness at her own house.
“I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I have been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself that justice must be on your side, or man’s countenance is no longer to be relied on.”
“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye.
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look.
“Why didn’t the baron come himself?” demanded Buckingham.
Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone, drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time, broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right.
As he finished, the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had been left out of the cellar.
“This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain.
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “let them now say that drama is unnatural!”
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives.
This time the poor girl did not even argue with D’Artagnan; she gave it to him at once.
“Do you intend opening the door?” said the baroness.
Athos did not lose sight of the two speakers.
I have known you four days; I have loved him four years.
“Sir,” replied the young man, “honest men are not to be paid with such coin.
He let off his fire at but four paces.
“Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?”
The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm.
“What do you want?” screamed Milady.
Athos smiled.
“Worthy fellows!” said Morrel,  as he went away, “may your new master love you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!”
“Yes; about in the same manner,” said another Musketeer, “that I bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one.”
Athos forced his way through and entered, followed by the young man.
I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it.”
The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard.
Thanks to the spurs, which served as stirrups, in a moment we were perched upon the croupe; we were well placed and saw everything.

“Ah, to see me?” said de Winter, cunningly.
“You can come and dine three times a week,” said Mme.
“Which is the young man?” asked De Winter, turning around.
Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, peas, and melons had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation.
Then he had run to the train, impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge, and full of confidence, as are those whom God blinds, he had set fire to the wick of nitre.
D’Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance.
“You are perfectly right, my lord.”
Every transport of a daughter finding a father, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt by Haydée during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so eagerly expected.
“Stuart,” Bradshaw was saying, “listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make.”
“Ah, ha,” said Albert, “I see you were preparing for a game of cards.”
“Then,” said the count, “your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial I request?
It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence.”
“’Tis capital; and pray, how did you acquire all these honors?”
Hallo, Fernand!
“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen, with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.
Who employed you to assassinate me?”
“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that I might test your character, and then surprise you.

The two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles.
And now that you have all you want, and that we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.”

Thinking that I might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure, together with the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if he approved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was married.
“_Parbleu!_ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day.”
Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first.
1.D.
Well, three days after that you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain.
“And besides, we have a prisoner,” said Athos, pointing to Raoul.

“I ask for no more.

They had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends.

Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”
It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to have only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer.

“‘You have determined, then, to abandon her to the common law?’ said Carlini.
“I beg of your majesty, then,” said Athos, calmly and not replying to Mazarin, “to quash these arrests of Messieurs d’Artagnan and du Vallon.”
This dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.
Whilst this went on, Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face, and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost merry.
He went toward the place where he had left him.
“Listen; I am already upon the scent,” resumed D’Artagnan.
“That is true,” said the king; “but never mind, Tréville, come still by the back staircase.”
“Ah, you are right, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “but you know Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and you know if I can dispose of them.”
I should have been pleased to see her, for I like her very much.”
It was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart, ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face.
Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape.
In a few hours they were in the capital.
“Ah, yes,” said the count; “that was the reason of your running away from us.”
“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly.
“Pardon me,” said he, smiling, “pardon me my dear compatriot, but I had wholly forgotten you.
“I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for instance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope, and I almost did so.
That’s another matter.
Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tréville—a thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain.
He was very taciturn, this worthy signor.
To grief succeeded rage.
He has put out the lamp, I can see nothing now.”
“Who am I?
“You would wish a notary to be sent for then?” said Valentine.
Yes,” he continued, sadly shaking his head, “Yes, it is as you said, misfortune, indeed, has overtaken us.
“No,” said Aramis, “but that fellow is a fiend; and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew.”
“You will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart tomorrow.”
Here are five francs for his trouble.”
“‘Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything.

Besides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable.
Section 3.
And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.
In fact, Porthos did not appear; for a scene, half tragedy and half comedy, had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois, who, frightened by the noise of the sea, by the whistling of the wind, by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them, shrank back instead of going forward.
“Perhaps it was some one in that occupation,” said Cromwell.
“Have you seen the cardinal?”

“But why into five parts?” asked Caderousse; “you only mentioned four persons.”
The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought, but at that moment, as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La Ramee’s ideas, Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to him.
“Be ready, then, at the first signal.”
“It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered,” murmured the host.
The Skiff “Lightning.” Chapter LXXI.
“Impossible!
Do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience.”
“Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart.”
“And what is that?” inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine hesitated.

“Yes, I dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of Madame de Chevreuse.
The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine; then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels, which enabled him to see into the adjoining room.

I pass my life upon my legs.”
“Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke.”

“He still lives.”
So long as the nets were good, they caught fish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine for new nets.
Unhappy he, who, on the brink of misfortune, broods over ideas like these!
“Aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend upon him with a gendarme.
Valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “If your intentions are pure, why are you here?” The count’s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.
Porthos breathed a sigh; he thought of what was in store for his poor horses.
“Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons.”

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
“Of what?” asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.
“And will you go?” asked Kitty.
He walked down the Rue Richelieu, meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn, for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be thought of, when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee.
“He was supercargo.”
“See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood—here on this shelf is my wife’s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix.
“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s patrons.”
La Carconte then entered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy, uncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her armchair, into which she fell as though exhausted.

“I have, sir.”
Meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of Athos, D’Artagnan became hourly more in love with Milady.
He fixed his eyes on that window—he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside, then the square cracked without falling.
“I think I understand his reason,” said Morrel.
“You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this,” said Porthos.
A boatman, who had passed by Rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks had greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.

He had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same evening; and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him, he persisted in having the review, hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him.
But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility?
From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers, but D’Artagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis.
More closely watched than ever, the queen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her women had betrayed her.
“That is better,” said the Gascon.
Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of Athos than I have; but I like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves.
“That’s what I mean,” said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio.
“That’s true,” said M. de Tréville; “I believed it later.

“‘Relate your story, madame,’ said he, wishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that the latter could not influence the wife’s story, to see if the two recitals tallied.
“Dearest, dearest Valentine,” exclaimed he, “forgive me if I have offended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain.”
First, my stranger of Meung; then De Wardes, to whom I have given three sword wounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the cardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.”

Still further, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises which fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels, one of the most insinuating lady’s men, one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the _bonnes fortunes_ of de Tréville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before, and that was not saying a little.

“Himself?
I am brutal,—I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business.
“What is his name; for, of course, you know?”
“Ah!
If I had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed and of steel.
The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and terror-stricken.
“I see; to your domestics you are ‘my lord,’ the journalists style you ‘monsieur,’ while your constituents call you ‘citizen.’ These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government.

Athos, do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets, roast beef reasonably cooked, and wine which is not made of hops and gin?”
“And shall we go and find him?” inquired Franz.
“Well,” continued Valentine, “the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.” Noirtier’s breathing came thick and short.
Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o’clock, the young men parted.
“A loan, nothing more!
“Almost an impossibility,” replied the major.
These horses evidently belonged to the three men, who were dressed as cavaliers.

Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand.

“Such feats, sir, are done once—and never repeated.”
“That comes of wearing diamonds, my master,” said Athos, disdainfully.
“Halloo!” cried D’Artagnan; “has something fresh happened?”

“Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”
Chapter 72.
Be silent, I will write.”
the people have seen Monsieur de Condé, a prince of the blood royal, arrested by my mother-in-law, Maria de Medicis; they saw my mother-in-law, their former regent, expelled by the cardinal; they saw Monsieur de Vendome, that is to say, the son of Henry IV., a prisoner at Vincennes; and whilst these great personages were imprisoned, insulted and threatened, they said nothing; and now for a Broussel—good God!

Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron’s card.

“Go,” he added, “and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee, and tell him that you suit me in all respects.”
Woe to them if it be so!”
D’Artagnan followed, but less nimbly, showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed.
The ball fired by Porthos’s foe went through the throat of his horse, which fell, groaning.
He hastened to the rendezvous, found the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel, and came to find Athos, who had just received this information when his friends returned.

“Not a word.”
There they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venthie.
Two days previously, the article had appeared in another paper besides _ l’Impartial_, and, what was more serious, one that was well known as a government paper.
“Empty your pockets,” said he; “I want a hundred pounds, and as for my own——” and he emptied them inside out.
Let us shut this one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it stood in.
Have I friends?
“Was ordered to remain at Martigues.”
I will warn them.”
_Au revoir_, Benedetto;” and running into a court, he disappeared.
“In that case he must either have paid his debts——”
“No, my lord; but I have already told you what that damned magician predicted.”
Albert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of Yanina, proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego, in the service of Ali Tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million crowns.
“The order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”
You said, ‘Let us die here!’ I recall to you that word.”
Before we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see double; and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble.
march forward!”
And Louis XIII.
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, “let us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord de Winter desired us to do.”
“With your belt, my lord!” replied La Ramee.
“Well?” asked he.
At length, one by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased.
No.
Tell me, Valentine for it is that I came to know.”
I say you understand this, because you are as conversant with my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them better, since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame, that you know perfectly well.
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman.”
Cloud, opposite D’Estrées’s pavilion?
“The Comte de Rochefort!
Albert related it to his mother; Château-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey Club, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister; even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count’s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy.
“Hold your tongue!
The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow.
He had stopped, like Raoul, at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle, the best at Compiegne; and had started again on his journey, saying that he should sleep at Noyon.
I love you as one loves a father, brother, husband!
Milady replied mechanically, “Yes, that is happiness.” She was thinking of something else.
“Entirely; go on.”
“Ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o’clock precisely?”
“I cannot tell you; I don’t know him.”
“From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad the Sailor.”
my sole heir, that I have bu...
“You will be lost,” said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.
yes, and to hang me.”
And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door, which noiselessly closed after him.
“I fear, Valentine,” replied the lover, “that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me.”
“Well, what then?” La Ramee began to be uneasy; “unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you.”
Unfortunately, Edmond’s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular.
“Yes.” D’Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier:
“You were at the festival of your marriage?” said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself.
Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in the other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as I am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring progress.”
“As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty,” said Aramis, coloring, “I will take that upon myself.
And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count, Mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared.
Oh, the devil!
This was the more so because Bonacieux’s reflections were all rose-colored.
That is rather difficult, but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty.
“Yes, but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon; the donjon being taken, I should be obliged to let them hang you—at which I should be most unhappy, certainly.”
Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!”
“I, my lord?” said D’Artagnan; “why should I?”
What could put such an idea into your head?”
“Good-day,” said he.
“I knew his father, M. Zaccone.”
Dantès made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through a mist.
Athos was scarcely aged at all!
“We are going again, it appears, to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways.”
“Why, that I may be dangerously wounded—killed even.”
Do you hear?”
I make no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own, and then judge for yourself.”
“It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now just a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.
“Ex-major in the Austrian service?”
D’Artagnan thought for a moment, then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out.
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count’s pistol.
“Oh,” said Morcerf, “this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is not all on my side.”
“Silence!”
In the meantime, I remain here.
He would fain have continued, but his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight became so dim, that he was forced to pause.
Are you then making a thesis?”
“Remember,” answered the abbé calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock, “it is your fault, not mine, that I do so.
“I saw her.”
“What?”
“No; it was he who introduced himself to us.”
“Patrick, remain here, or rather join the king, wherever he may be, and tell his Majesty that I humbly beg him to excuse me, but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to London.
These were all who were left of the little troop.
This great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man, who—a rather improbable thing—had stolen his father’s letter from him—was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred?
“Fool!”
Look, Fernand, your eyes are better than mine.
You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that:
my poor mother!” said Villefort, “to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow!”
“Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
oh, yes, tired enough—he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day!
Mazarin rose.
“You are wrong to speak thus,” said the abbé; “and perhaps I may, in my own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.”
The poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended.
At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little garden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light.
He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not.
The means we might have used, which we in our blindness could not see, then seem simple and easy, and we say, ‘Why did I not do this, instead of that?’ Women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the decision does not come from you,—your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you, and your faults the results of others’ crimes.”
“It is now your turn, monsieur le chevalier.”
“Of what consequence?” replied Milady.
He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.
here is madame returning with monsieur.”
“Indeed?”
“That is true,” said Porthos, echoing D’Artagnan’s sigh.
I ought to have known you better by this time; but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit, which bids us doubt.”
“The name of the owner of the winning horse?”
“Perfectly.”
Suddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church opened.
I?” said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment.
Villefort stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld his child lying—no doubt asleep—on the sofa.
At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag.
He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of Mercédès.
This fortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months passed away, then six more.
Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of whose arrival he was ignorant.
Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you, and, perhaps, to others.
The less pretension there is in your attire, the better will be the effect, as you are a rich man.
“Why, then, didn’t you reply?”
There one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous susceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit sustains him as breath animates the body; and M. de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject, which I have never forgotten.
“By introducing to you a new acquaintance.”
“Dearest,” exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, “awake, and look at me!” Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful, dazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.
The cardinal repressed a smile.
“Oh, but I,” said Anne, “I also, duke, have had presentiments; I also have had dreams.
“Good Lord!
“Yes.”
But now we must part.
“To be sure I do—furiously!”
Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse Vampa?”
Why the devil!
“There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,” said Eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; “and you appear satisfied with the explanation.
THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES
He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up, and took out two ribbons of the Order of the Garter.
“Well, I feel as if transformed—a confession weighs on my mind.”
“Well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me, Athos.”
The young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair had no other sequel.
“I hope, sir,” replied the youth, smiling, “that there’s no idea of a marriage for me; you know of my engagement to Louise?”
“Good, my friend, good!” said Athos.
“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned the Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”
“Devil take them; let us walk in the park,” answered Porthos, “for the sake of digestion.”
Morrel smiled.
His desire for revenge had not forsaken him.
“What do you want with me?” said she.
“Besides,” said Dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.”
Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French of Rome, with whom your father does business.”
Monte Cristo started.
“‘An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.’
“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself.
What is become of them?”
An instant later, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew near, the door opened, and a man appeared.
This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach.
0329m
“Just so madame,” replied Chatillon, in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation.
Afterward?”
“Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?”
“Why, it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation.
Section 5.
Franz continued:
In consequence, he brought them the key of his own—at least such was the apparent motive of his visit.
George Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said, restored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his hat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with joy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for, he smiled upon himself with pride and hope.
A bright spot burned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her pulse beat with feverish excitement.
This itinerary possessed another great advantage,—that of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrini’s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up.
“The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you.”
So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were.
Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brother-in-law.
“You are still growing,” Athos continued, with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth.
Noirtier’s eye remained immovable.
“My lord,” said Comminges, who, irritated by his wounds, wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow, “shall I fire off a ball to punish that jester, and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future?”
“Yes,” repeated the count.
“What is to happen?” said Porthos.
“I wish to consult you on this passage, ‘_Molli fugiens anhelitu_,’ you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf.
“I am glad to see,” said D’Artagnan, “that you have still that honest lad with you.”
They were yours, you disposed of them according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.”
“I will answer for him, count.”
The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of.
He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart, and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were, diabolical.
“To one in Edmond’s position the diamond certainly was of great value.
But Bazin, still the servant of a musketeer, when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks, seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois, saying:
D’Artagnan glanced at the dinner service.
However, recovering my strength and my ideas, ‘Why,’ said I, ‘should that man have carried away the corpse?’”
He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders.
There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent, careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.
Mordaunt!” cried the three friends; “’tis Mordaunt!”
D’Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had no doubt seen all, and could tell its tale.
“You see it is a serious annoyance,” said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph.
Bonacieux knocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps.
“‘Besides, I shall be there.’
“Nor hang me.”
He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half an hour,—no change took place.
“Five,” answered Groslow, “one every two hours.”
She extended her hands to him with a smile.
“Ah, that is true.
At this moment La Ramee, after the interview we have described with the cardinal, entered the room.
He had gone down about three-quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke.
“I dare not return with those dreadful horses,” said Madame de Villefort.
“About a quarter of an hour,” said D’Artagnan, motioning to Porthos not to contradict him.
“Well,” said he, “but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?”
What had become of him he cared not to inquire.
Our young men had been waiting about half an hour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open, and his Majesty was announced.
“Monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, “this was what happened to me—”
Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:
“The epistle is laconic,” said D’Artagnan; “and if there had not been a postscript, probably I should not have understood it; but happily there is a postscript.”
It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury.
“Beware of what you are about, gentlemen!” said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command.
“Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not a very good-tempered gentleman.”
“I am.”
By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes.
“Adieu, sir, adieu, my beloved protector.”
Now my fault is repaired.
“You have your liberty?” repeated Mazarin, in terror.
“Oh,” he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair—“Oh, who will deliver me from this man?
“What ones?”
‘No,’ was the old man’s reply, ‘I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?’ I heard all this from the window, for I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment’s repose.”
“Do not run down M. Danglars’ speeches,” said Debray; “he votes for you, for he belongs to the opposition.”
“‘It is true.’
“Well, _pardieu!_” said Aramis, “it was only this: I had a dream, and I related it to her.”
“She revives!” cried the young man.
“Rest assured; put the gag in, Grimaud.”
D’Artagnan smiled—for he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret.
“Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.”
Two hours afterward Dantès sailed from the port of Genoa, under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht.
“Oh, no, dear count!” cried Aramis, “is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to?”
“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.”
They arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion.
He was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.” Then he added, “Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.”
There, crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes talking to one another, but more frequently alone, watching the door, which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or to throw in another outcast from society.
He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room, where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive.
“Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of fatigue.
“Our landlord’s, to be sure.
M. de Tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake to find him, let him be where he might.
Raoul entered at this moment; he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king, queen, and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day.
The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris, followed by Mousqueton, who, after being too cold all night, at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm.
Hem!” said the king.
The betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful lip, and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion, who was paler and more disturbed than herself.
“Mazarin is better lodged,” said Aramis.
The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there, and presented it to the cardinal.
“I wish to see the governor.”
Die in peace!”
“I?” said Mercédès, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and again becoming paler than ever.
“Withdraw, young man,” cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and the expression of his countenance, had guessed D’Artagnan’s design.
“No,” said Villefort, rising hastily; “stay where you are.
“Did she stay long there?”
The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice.
“‘Monsieur,’ I said, ‘my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nîmes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.
“Then that will make only 4,998 louis more,” said Peppino with the same indifference.
The count advanced, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel.
“Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at least.”
“And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,” he said, by way of changing the conversation, “you pass your life in travelling?”
The horses were at the place fixed upon, and they leaped lightly into their saddles.
“That is an important point, do you understand?”
“Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this scrape solely from having served me.
“I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.”
“Contempt, my friend?
I made them one day to calculate the age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still living, and that of Mercédès, to know if I should find her still free.
D’Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, “Here, my friend, write your name upon it and become my chief.”
“Impossible, my Lord!
The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all took part against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, “Put him to death!
I fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his relief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent.
“Again!” said D’Artagnan, whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners_.
Grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.
This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit.
At length D’Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a woman’s torn glove.
“Yesterday, at Saint Germain, as he came out from the presence of the queen.”
A light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance of her jailers.
“Magnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame.”
“Yes.”
“That letter is not lost!” cried he.
Albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his moustache, then, having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves.
It is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon Louis XIII.
“But, _à propos_,” resumed M. de Tréville, “what has become of your three companions?”
“Who told you?”
The prisoner’s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air—for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La Réserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball.
Everything is best in its time, monseigneur.
Milady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.
“Nothing.”
“Perhaps you speak the truth, Aramis.”
“Well, have you tied the knot?” inquired the grave-digger, who was looking on.
Three things were especially urged upon the officers, who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously: the first, that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps; the second, to go to the charge no faster than a walk; the third, to let the enemy fire first.
“You know they are never closed.
But we must not lose time.
We don’t know the locality, and shall never find the wall.
“Aramis!
The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious lodger entered at ten o’clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon.
Then who loads his pistol?”
“You have answered that you should recognize him,” said the commissary.
You think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy—change of scene.” And Morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity.
“I will complain to Monsieur de Tréville, and Monsieur de Tréville will complain to the king.” He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and remounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident to the gate of St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three crowns, which was a very good price, considering that D’Artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage.
“For whom are you looking, my fine fellow?” asked the fruiteress on the opposite side.
As to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that will accustom you to his maneuvers.”
‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of Vasiliki, his beloved wife.’
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor.
The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room, as not only to make the passage impassable, but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward.
He had always something or other to do.
“I ask your pardon, my dear count,” said Albert, “for following you here, and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the indiscretion.
“Yes.”
It was three o’clock in the afternoon.
I love my sister Julie,—I love her husband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last moments.
“Very well——”
“No, I have left off laughing, now that you speak French.”
“What do you mean, sir?” inquired Raoul.
The Journey Chapter 86.
I draw upon him for 600,000 francs, my bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his correspondent’s in Paris at the end of this month.
“My friend,” said he, “my life is ended.
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance of Athos.
Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass.
“I shall have nothing to fear but robbers.”
“No cardinal!” said D’Artagnan, “but only his lantern; where the devil, then, is he?”
“Upon my word,” said Dantès, “you make me shudder.
The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed.
“Why, if today before eleven o’clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o’clock to declare himself a bankrupt.”
It’s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all.”
One can say anything to me.
“That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice, never.”
At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud.
“Ah, this marriage will never take place,” said Beauchamp.
“You must know it is not his element.”
no doubt you come to join the princes!”
“Have pity on me, count!”
Franz said no more.
More pale and menacing than Athos, D’Artagnan stood on the threshold.
“Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?”
Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred fixing it.
“Ah, you see that plan was not sure enough; he might go out by one gate and return by another.”
“I, who have nothing to lose,—I should go.”
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness.
“I assure you, madame,” replied the woman, “it is as I have said.”
I own I was seeking them.”
Well, my friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said.
“And now,” said the queen, “we are forgetting one very necessary thing.”
“My father knows me,” replied Villefort; “he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my position I cannot plead against the poor.” The eye of Noirtier beamed with triumph.
Firstly, I wish to communicate; secondly, to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time.
As Lord de Winter had thought, Milady’s wound was not dangerous.
Chapter 62.
The count put his head out of the window and whistled, and the horses appeared to fly.
As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.
“No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot be done, there is an end of it.”
They sing—let them pay the piper.
Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and, with his hat in hand, prepared to pass by the two friends, motioning to the four men to follow him.
Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was.
Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves.”
So I shall never be a great man, as he was, but to compensate for that, I shall be a good man, Monsieur de Rochefort, and I hope to prove it to you.”
Then, in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs, whither had come so many courtiers, the scene of so much flattering homage, alone with a despairing servant, whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own, the king at last yielded to sorrow, and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness, those shadows, and that wintry cold.
“The devil thou dost not!
“Go to bed, mademoiselle,” said Milady; “I don’t like comments.”
Lord Winter’s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee, a kind of corridor communicating between the two.
The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs.”
“Return to camp and you shall know.”
He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted.
“To give your majesty’s reply to those who await it.”
Ah!
“A hundred leagues.”
Andrea appeared in despair, but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that No.
And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman.
“It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that his writing might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the post.”
Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are not inviolable.
made Richelieu smile.
It has its own effect upon the most incredulous; and far from being incredulous, Mazarin was superstitious.
“No, _pardieu;_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow horse.
“Then you will appear?”
“I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal impression.”
“Come upstairs with me, and I will give it to you.”
There is nothing more easy,” said Mousqueton, with a modest air.
He has received visits from the coadjutor, from Madame de Longueville, and the Prince de Conti; Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his door.
I will call Salvieux and make him write the letter.”
In fact, a great noise was heard in the ante-chamber; at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man, covered with dust, rushed into it, exclaiming:
Are the oars in the boat?”
But we know very well what had become of Edmond.
“Yes,” said the major, “I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye.”
The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the St. Eustache Church, watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling.
“Faith, I’ve half a mind to do it.
“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII.
“Yes.”
“Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?” inquired Eugénie; “does anybody know?”
“You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?”
The Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new.
I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M.
“No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?”
That’s a match you are playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game.
I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his valet-de-chambre.”
“Do you think anything else was to be expected of them?” asked Comminges, who, putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said, began to feel a degree of uneasiness.
The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes.
As he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence, D’Artagnan went straight to the residence of Athos.
“You think so?”
“Put back that weapon, D’Artagnan!” said he; “this woman must be tried, not assassinated.
“Baron Danglars.’”
The cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still more.
The horses, excited by pain and emulation, raced over the dark road, in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass, denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon.
Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest favor.
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” said Danglars, more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery.
“You seem geographically engaged, sir?
“Once upon a time there lived a queen—a powerful monarch—who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well.
At this moment Barrois entered.
“The marriage will take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.
“Come, count, you do not do that young man justice.”
Then he had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the stiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir.
The next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. Edmond hoped he was dying.
“Yes; I will accompany you.”
Which?”
Grimaud looked after him, and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper.
Andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad, and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people, amongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king’s attorney.
“What is your errand, then, with me, sir?”
“There go two miscreants;” said he, “it is a pity they are not really related!” Then, after an instant of gloomy reflection, “Come, I will go to see the Morrels,” said he; “I think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred.”
“Her name, her name!” cried D’Artagnan.
Why, they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.”
“There is but one way.”
From the Rue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie, from the Rue Saint Thomas-du-Louvre to the Pont Neuf, from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte Saint Honore, there were more than ten thousand armed men; those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal, the gates of which were closed behind them, a precaution which made their situation precarious.
M. Danglars dined with me.”
He made a movement of surprise and said:
“Remain, Parry.
The attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal’s horse by the bridle.
As he gazed at him Mazarin shook his head slightly, as much as to say, “This is a man who does not appear to me fit for much.”
“Got what?”
It had not been used.
He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon; every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears.
He could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Athos.
“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he invite you to dine?”
At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away.
They sent him a magnificent supper, and took his million.
Ah, stop!
“We shall have the pleasure another time,” said the countess; “you promise that?”
The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise.
“I neither know nor wish to know him.
“Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.”
You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword by your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these gentlemen will serve you.
Athos, assisted by Porthos, who lifted him up like a feather, arrived at the top.
The host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and some water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain.
Monte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there was a stone veil between him and the firmament.
He found the cardinal dressed as an officer, and he looked very well in that costume, which, as we have already said, he wore elegantly; only he was very pale and trembled slightly.
“Where will he receive me?”
However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence, he understood the reasons D’Artagnan had given him; besides, completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen, all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom.
The count laid his hand on Franz’s shoulder.
“Yes, happy as myself,” said he.
“Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?”
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.
“War for the king.”
“‘Well,’ replied he, ‘he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.’
De Wardes, one of the cardinal’s men, a cousin of Rochefort!
Presently it sounded one o’clock.
“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always so dear.”
Meanwhile, do not be surprised at anything that happens; prepare yourself for every emergency.”
“How do I know?
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady, and shut the door.
He took Monte Cristo aside.
“But your companions?”
“The beautiful Greek of yesterday.”
But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step; so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it.
There was no more to be had in Saint Germain.
We have forgotten to mention, that the count’s coachman was attired in a bear-skin, exactly resembling Odry’s in _The Bear and the Pasha_; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring masks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed.
Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to announce D’Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be, came to Aramis on leaving Athos.
“Qui vive?” he asked.
And, to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet, the count seemed to have the power of fascination.
It must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme.
Porthos bowed to the cardinal.
three!”
“Sell it, then.”
“Yes,—if I die!”
I wished to make my adieux to you, but time does not permit.
“Will you give me a lesson the day after to-morrow?”
but if I mistake not,” continued he, “here he is; you won’t forget the boy, sir.”
His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past, of times present, and probably of times to come.
“Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have worn, and that I may wear in my turn—a ring, a necklace, a chain.”
30241m
And that you should fail me!”
“How many covers?”
What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?”
He made his way along the corridors through force of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of deference to etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a veritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture.
Villefort fell, rather than seated himself.
It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk’s bones.
PORTHOS
He has lost four or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but it is not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his finances.
In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared, and Dantès could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut steel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which was still untarnished, the arms of the Spada family—viz., a sword, _en pale_, on an oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and surmounted by a cardinal’s hat.
“I have that permission,” said the gentleman, drawing the paper from his pocket; “here it is.”
“Bigamy, my dear!
And they went out together.
But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber.
“_Pardieu!_”
Chapter LXXIX.
“Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples, or Florence.”
When he had gained the angle of the street, he turned.
“You may venture to ask me anything.”
Chapter LX.
For was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud?
Albert at this moment ran in.
Now, if you please, remove your bandage.” The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes.
Bonacieux; “you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take.”
“And I, my dear Aramis,” quietly replied Athos, “I think it would only change Monsieur de Retz’s appearance.
I send them, but like Pilate—washing my hands.”
The guards retired; the room resumed its obscurity.
Although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked.
“The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.”
“Fortunately,” added he, “my good friends are down yonder, and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle.
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly embarrassed.
“That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly.”
“Decidedly,” muttered Franz, “this is an Arabian Nights’ adventure.”
“No, I use your generosity, that’s all.
all, all, all, are thine, my adored mistress!”
Monsieur Bertuccio Chapter 43.
It was a dull, foggy night.
You remember what a beautiful night it was?
“Yes, I am known, so that——”
“And when?” asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.
“Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory?”
“Retire, Valentine,” said she; “you are really suffering, and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.”
“Of what country?”
“Ah, here is my mother,” cried the viscount.
“Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch of him.”
We have accomplished more difficult things than that.
never!
He found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given directions.
“Everywhere.”
D’Artagnan turned toward her, saying, “Then send him away, madame.”
“Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did you not?”
They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman.
At length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night, Dantès, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall, fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones.
“And tell him,” cried a voice, “that I am not too old yet for a man of action.”
“And, now, when are we to go?” asked Athos.
“Courage, sir,” said Raoul to the wounded man.
“No one; his parents are unknown.”
“Bricconi!” muttered he.
These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness.
The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for.
Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.
The day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence of the noise.
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF ARAMIS
“There is no situation, however terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon himself.
Then all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest.
“Are you afraid for your young Raoul?” asked Aramis.
Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures; he was a man of uncommonly sound sense.
Her mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt.
“Now, sir,” continued Morrel, “in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable creature like Valentine.
“Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlemagne.”
“Wait a minute, then,” said Aramis.
“You mistake—I understand you perfectly.
They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened the door inside.
“Sir,” said Valentine, “I will do all I can to live, for there are two beings who love me and will die if I die—my grandfather and Maximilian.”
“You must know, monsieur, that Marie Michon, when she returned to France in 1643, immediately sought for information about that child; as a fugitive she could not take care of it, but on her return she wished to have it near her.”
“It seems to me,” said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a forced smile, “that you have already got horses enough.”
“I am sorry for that,” said D’Artagnan; “for as I am in great haste likewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.”
“What do you wish, gentlemen?”
The dog sprang, and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it.
Besides,” added he, lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal, “let us give them apparent security; that is policy.”
“And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome?”
“You thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch!
“_Ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.”
“Leave him with me,” replied the duchess.
The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling.
Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments?”
“Cousin-german.”
50151m
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful, and so full of affectionate admiration, that she turned back and grasped his hand; at the same time she seized that of her son, and joined them together.
The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or disapproving.
Poor young creature!
“But remember——”
She had been there some moments, and had heard the last words of the visitor.
“Oh, don’t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.”
I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and unalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap.”
“You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just now, and I now again warn you.”
“You will tell him, my lord,” resumed the queen, despairingly, “that I can do nothing; that I have suffered as much as himself—more than he has—obliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears; and as regards his royal person, he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king.
My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces, and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose.
“When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.”
There were also less agreeable visits—for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.
“Search, then, monsieur!
“Eh, who knows?
There was a silence of several seconds.
“And you sing chorus,” replied Guitant, laughing.
He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind the angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man.
There’s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights.”
It had been resolved the night before to change their encampment.
They were innumerable.
It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France.
Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop; the noise came nearer and nearer.
“Alas!” sighed Bazin.
“I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.”
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?”
“Why,” said Porthos, “that was very good of him, it seems to me.”
We have money?”
I dare say you know how to navigate, should he fail us.”
He saw nothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain.
The report of firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace.
“Edmond, you will not kill my son!”
“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.
“You mistake, sir,” said Morcerf with a gloomy smile; “I am not referring in the least to matrimony, and I only addressed myself to M. Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us.
“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was four years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single detail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events concern you?
“Is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?”
Row, Porthos, row.” And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea; two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further.
“But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?” asked the abbé.
really, yes,” said the coadjutor, “I have heard this affair mentioned.
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?
“I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion, instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty.
Aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the epistle, which contained what follows:
My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation, which makes my heart glad when I hear it.”
“Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000 francs a month.”
“My fault?” said he; “you must be mad!
“Who—I?” cried Milady; “I a Protestant?
“No, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear gentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.
“Why, they are our men.”
“As you please,” said Athos.
Bernouin bowed and retired.
Where is the count, friend?
As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name.
It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family, for she was pale and looked fatigued.
“My way is the way of all gentlemen, and I know only one way,” answered Athos, haughtily.
“Then you must know what her name was as a young girl.”
“Marie de Montbazon.
“Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Babylon, of which you have no doubt heard tell.”
One of these ladies, the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her strength.
“I think so.”
But this is not to the purpose,—our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in peace.”
Chapter 4.
“Where is he now?”
“The day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner.
At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king.
“Countersigned by you?”
“Well,” said Comminges, “suppose one thing.”
One day—it was the morning of the day my story begins—the king, Louis XIV., then ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small-pox, to Notre Dame.
“Yes, and up to this point I know all,” said the priest.
“Ay, ay!” said Athos, exchanging a smile with D’Artagnan and Aramis, “it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is like a good master.”
“That’s well,” said Athos, “let us go home and read it.”
Milady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only desire was to be left alone.
“You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,” said Villefort; “but I shall explain to him your state of health, and make excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one.”
Tomorrow, for instance, he is going to spend the day and night there.”
“Yes.
“No, sire,” replied Tréville, who saw at the first glance how things would go, “on the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs, and have but one desire, I’ll be their warranty.
“And here we are at the ninth.
“Yes, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan; “here it is.”

“Let us sit down.”
“You see, Edmond, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, ‘Spare my son!’”
Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder; I am not much of a hand at figures, so that I live almost from hand to mouth.”
Besides, it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life.”
The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body.
“How so?” cried Morrel, “when I left her dying?”
“By no means,” replied the young lady quickly; “but this is the hour when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence.
The ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors.”
The hand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.
“Yes, hither.”
“Why not?”
“Ah!
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her of it.
“Into my room first,” replied Comminges; “the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile.”
“No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet I have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which is more than can be said for all philosophy.”
Mordaunt was startled.
“You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you, Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed for a considerable time with somebody?”
You are somewhat _blasé_ I know, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor, who has seen so many others.
Monk or priest, it matters not, provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis.”
de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.
“Oh!
“I wish to know—can you tell me, pray—is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town?”
And, to complete the whole, Haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms—she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers.
I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king’s attorney.”
I will tell him the ties which bind me to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through interest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no other, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall kill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry Valentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.”
The Promise
At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon.
Bonacieux.
“Approach, gentlemen,” said Albert; “I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte Cristo, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it, strange as it may appear to you.”
“And you know who I am, without doubt?”
“Yes,” answered Maximilian, “but I feel sure he has an excellent heart, and that he likes us.”
Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit him.
“Your Eminence means Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
The company was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which D’Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme.
“We are going to fetch our brevets,” said D’Artagnan, “and when we come back, Master Mazarin will sign them.”
Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him, and remembering the recommendation of Athos, he, with the rapidity of lightning, made his horse rear as the shot was fired.
D’Artagnan went straight to M. de Tréville’s.
“Yes, you understand, that explains all.
The Cemetery of the Château d’If
The man opened his eyes, made an effort to raise his head, and fell back again.
“Diavolo!
We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musketeer.
‘I once possessed four dear and faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed’ he said; ‘and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.
Athos was happy—happy as he had never been before.
“Pooh!
I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God; last of all I speak to you.
The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars—a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white Indian muslin.
“We redouble our precautions.”
“Very ill, say you?
Oh, my God, my God, have pity on me!”
“Who wrote to Yanina?”
Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor; and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady, he was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this Puritan.
“How?” asked Blaisois, “I can?
Valentine hid her head between her hands.
“Oh!
All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital.
Now his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do.
“Be satisfied; I promise you that.”
“I!” cried D’Artagnan, “I doubt what you say!
He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Tréville’s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Tréville’s office.
“And have you not seen any of our other friends?”
“The devil!
Chapter XXIX.
Adieu.”
“To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger.
“Oh,” cried the duchess, “I cannot make war alone, but I can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite-on the honor of a duchess, I will avenge myself.”
The queen fell into a chair, took the pen and signed.
“The lights again!
The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply.
Halloo!
On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him; he started with delight when, on demanding the name of this young man, he learned that it was Louvieres.

Oh, woe to me!”
“Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,” said Villefort; “M.
“When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again.
And the duke swooned.
The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other.
“I’faith, I don’t know.
“By the faith of a gentleman.
“But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.”
D’Artagnan and Porthos went on, meantime, to Paris.
“I have, indeed.”
“The two travelers consulted for a moment.
“There was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that sincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction to the most perverse minds, for he paused.
Beauchamp left the box, perfectly amazed.
“Do not question me,” said the prisoner; “you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to lie.”
But D’Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship.
Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and windows.
“Think of the offense you have committed toward me, madame!
“_Ma foi_, my dear sir,” replied Franz, “make no apologies.
“But if they come?”
Milady was not deceived.
Stay!
40038m
I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.
“Ah!
“Pen, ink, and paper, then,” called Fernand loudly.
I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years.
The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes.
“Of what must I repent?” stammered Danglars.
That brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must run head foremost, like a ram.
Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear that D’Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time necessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not D’Artagnan.
“You want Valentine, do you not?
Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice had Villefort soothed him with promises.
“Dead or desperately wounded, as I left without having been able to hear anything of him.
“Excuse me, my lord,” said the lad; “but will you have the kindness to wait a moment?”
“Do you still wish to dispose of all?”
“Stay, marechal; I will not appear to parley with rebels.”
“‘“Another method of assassination?” said the general, shrugging his shoulders.
What shall I do now?”
Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed the contents at a gulp.
I present my letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seek—not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but to Paris, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while the cardinal is at La Rochelle.
“’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the old man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.
But Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold.
About this time, a band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be much spoken of.
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin.
Ali bowed and left the room.
A thousand livres!
He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I desired.
“Fifty thousand livres—a mere trifle.”
His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss, whence he awoke, bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen.
He obeyed, not without some uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially one in such a situation as Danglars.
“This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a buttercup,” resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun, and addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying the least attention to the exasperation of D’Artagnan, who, however, placed himself between him and them.
“I feel the same as regards yourself.” said Valentine; “and I own that, if you have no stronger proof to give me——”
At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly.
You would like very well to be at liberty on that beach!
My father,” said Haydée, raising her head, “was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.”
“A paltry piece of business!” murmured D’Artagnan crumpling his note.
“I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,” replied the host, “but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability, _incognito_.”
“Yes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest criminal.”
Before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of some peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet, casting off the lion’s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.
If he demands my daughter let him fix the day—declare his conditions; in short, let us either understand each other, or quarrel.
Morrel guessed all this.
“No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and will try to cure myself of my ambition.”
“Yes,” said Valentine; “and I have but one scruple,—that of leaving my dear grandmother’s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.”
These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth.
If we had only been looking for Porthos, Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him.
The king thanked M. de Tréville, and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.
Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding M. de Villefort’s house, and, behind the gate, half screened from view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance.
courage!
“Good!
After having been for some time after the death of Louis XIII.
“Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work.
“The queen wishes to speak to Monsieur d’Artagnan, who must follow the bearer.”
She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny, who, for her sake, had been killed in a duel, in the Place Royale, by the Duc de Guise.
Franz interrupted himself by saying, “My father was a royalist; they need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.”
No, I do not dance, but I like to see others do so.
“Mordaunt.”
“My dear friend,” said Aramis, “remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse, and ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him.
Ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey.
Chapter III.
Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence.
“Well, well,” cried D’Artagnan, “this reconciliation is truly touching; have you not tears in your eyes, Porthos?”
You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all descended from princes.”
“I hoped for a moment that it might,” said Villefort; “but that happiness was denied me.
Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically, “Julie, Julie—Emmanuel, Emmanuel!”
“Extremely,” replied he; “she looked so pale this morning, I scarcely knew her.”
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, rising, “we have them, friend Porthos, and even something better.”
La Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the diversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.
But you first came to breakfast, did you not?
It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in which D’Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this detention.
Happily he did not meet anyone.
D’Artagnan!
“I, pardieu!”
She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark hair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a complexion marbled with rose and opal.
Valentine screamed.
“But in either case, what is to be done?” said the young man.
“I am in his Majesty’s Guards, monseigneur, and I have no reason to be dissatisfied.”
yes,” said Groslow, bursting with his usual coarse laugh, “I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises.”
“Then,” said the count, “I am emboldened to speak openly to you.
The other members silently dispersed.
Besides, you owe me some thanks.
The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated.
What?
“What!” cried D’Artagnan, “is your first witness Monsieur Porthos?”
“But,” said Bazin, yawning portentously, “the ladder is still at the window.”
“That will be useless.”
Who is he?”
All was dark; one solitary, feeble light was burning in the porter’s lodge, about forty paces distant from the house, as Baptistin had said.
50275m
“My dear M. d’Artagnan, the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands.” He paused.
“Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you know my devotion to you.”
“Then run to the door, and open it yourself.”
I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking fellow—admirably dressed.
All this the young man perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second.
“On what occasion?” asked Beauchamp.
“And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman?”
Eight days after, I was back again, madame.
All our servants are busy, discussing the grand affair.
It was Captain Groslow, the reader will remember, who had broken Parry’s head.
Those who are known are not the most dangerous.”
While reading this letter, D’Artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers.
He answered in the same language.
The old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he fell into his arms, pale and trembling.
Mordaunt remained standing near the door.
“And we, Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “will return, carrying our shame to the cardinal.”
“Certainly it was not the cardinal; but don’t trouble yourself whence they come, think only that one of the three is your property.”
“Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence.
In military dress he was, indeed, as we have stated, a very handsome man.
The procureur went out, after having double-locked the door.
be Christians!
“He will be found.”
“Was this Englishman protecting you?”
It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other end of France.
“Why, good God!
“At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?”
Villefort stood with his mouth half open, quite stupefied.
How will the crown, which is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV., support a double weight?”
“Heavens!
“Silence, then!” cried Athos.
“You are wounded,” said he.
“You think, then, that I may rely on the count’s promises?”
“It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,” said the young lady, motionless with attention.
“To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country——”
“Agreed; but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery, to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall, which causes a tub to turn, revealing a staircase—must not one speak of that a little, my lord?”
Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the window-curtains.
“Sir,” replied the wounded man, “believe me, there is no time to lose; the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines.”
“Entirely, my dear count.
Uneasy and almost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather.
But my fears were this time ill-founded; I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I dreaded.
it is no affair of mine.”
“You see, my poor friend, that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness; perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you, who have evidently a leaning to Mazarin.”
“Oh, I expect him every minute.”
Formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman; but now it was a different thing; he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general.
The pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and murmured his daughter’s name.
But that is not all—after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold, not by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the whole; then from hunger by sharing with me—guess what?”
But all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt.
“I had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should have been twenty.
My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before, but in vain.
I have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is not this true, Fernand?”
In former days I had not only three friends, I had thirty; at two-and-twenty one calls every man one’s friend.”
“Ah!
Come!”
“How so?” returned the count, with surprise.
At this moment the clock struck.
“What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!”
“And that being conducted to the scaffold,” resumed the queen—“oh, my lord!
“You are mistaken, my dear viscount.”
He was silent for an instant, and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first.
“I tell you what, my dear fellow,” said Château-Renaud, “I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglars—that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way I don’t think you care very much about.
“I wish my lord would make me one promise.”
“His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,” said Julie.
you thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city.
How old was she?”
The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim.
“By my grandfather.
There is none,” said Athos.
On the other hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly.
“Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud?”
“Afoot, my lord; I have served always in the infantry.
The gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken between two fires.
The initials are only mine—C.
7; the others are on the mantle-piece of your excellency’s bedroom.”
“Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation.
This to me, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise.
go to!
It was necessary to separate.
Jesus Seigneur.
“Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of Fernand Mondego.
“I suppose so,” said Andrea with a triumphant smile, “since I am accepted.
“I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands near here—the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen—and then I should have been safe.”
“Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have capital sport.”
He considered himself an outraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover.
“Certainly,” replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate, greatly delighted, turned upon D’Artagnan a look full of gratitude.
“Ah, yes!” said Mousqueton.
“Certainly!
“I go,” said he; “I go at once.”
The Tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.
The Dappled Grays
“Yes, sir,” exclaimed Mordaunt, “they are friends, dear friends of mine, and I would lay down my life for them.”
“Not a word of what has passed.
D’Artagnan would have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder, with a smile, and D’Artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince.
Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task?
“Oh!
I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they would have made him a commander.”
“Art thou happy, friend?” asked D’Artagnan.
Then, having renewed his injunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to Noirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no one was listening:
Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain, but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her.
My cousin knows nobody but Bazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would fail.
Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who, like Satan, thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom.
“At least a year.”
“Take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing-room,” said the viscount; “they make the countess ill.”
Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots, from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores.
Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.”
“Lead us, Grimaud.”
“I was going to make you the offer, my dear D’Artagnan, giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle.”
That is to say, when you have received my instructions.
What men call the chances of fate—namely, ruin, change, circumstances—I have fully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it will not overwhelm me.
“Ah, monsieur,” said he, after having vainly searched on the mantle-piece and the shelves, “I have not got any candles.”
“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet melancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.
The others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room, and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace.
The coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life.
“One of yours!
The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude, whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother’s neck and kissed her—her own eyes streaming with tears.
You bring me down to your own level, and demand explanations!
“It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.”
“My dear,” said she, as she took the pen, “is it not vexatious?
It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.
But she was greatly embarrassed.
“I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person; but the face—”
“Gentlemen,” said Groslow, “I beg you will take your places.
An instant after they were on the deck.
They set out.
Wherefore did you not apply, then, madame, to the first person you saw from us?”
“Stay!” said the young man.
They are no longer sure.”
For one day—listen, my son—one day, if you do so, they will doom you to destruction, head and crown, too, and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience, as I die.
Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from Tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or rather went before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou to the Rue de Vaugirard.
Then, turning towards Beauchamp, “If you have anything to attend to, Beauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening, defer it till tomorrow.
The host recognized him.
He was Des Roches le Masle, canon of Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man.
Planchet was sent for, and instructions were given him.
“Bazin, my friend,” said Aramis, “I believe you meddle with my conversation.”
“Hush!
So, if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger sum.
I was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La Réserve, the day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.”
“We shall take the place of those two fellows.”
“Oh, had he been my own son,” replied Bertuccio, “or even my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me to punish him.
“To his Eminence, Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini:
“I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,” replied Villefort.
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain.
“I beseech you, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “not to spoil Ali, either by too great praise or rewards.
“Among friends, my dear Athos, no, you are right; but among enemies it would be only a stratagem.”
D’Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve for the other, so greatly was he still agitated.
“Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell?” inquired Porthos.
“That is it, my son.”
The marshal bit his fingers.
He sprang into his saddle; the lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage went off at a quick pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was over.
“Ah!” exclaimed Aramis, “that is the nephew, the monk, and the son of Milady, as he says himself.”
Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect.
I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.”
“He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die,” said the Gascon to himself.
“Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”
Hallo, Fernand!
They are aiming—they are going to fire!”
“Certainly.”
I repent of it?
This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba.
Soldiers are big children; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and more particularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed—”
“Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold; make all your arrangements, and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten o’clock.”
She herself was not exempt from internal emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her.
“My friend,” said Aramis, with a look of imbecility on his face which D’Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers, “if I did not come from Heaven, at least I was leaving Paradise, which is almost the same.”
Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.
Mazarin hesitated for one instant, but D’Artagnan was firm.
M. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head at the mention of this date.
“What have you eaten today?”
1.E.1.
“Ah, I knew her!” cried the duchess.
Albert bathed, took his supper, and went to bed.
“Who?”
That happened, as I told you, in 1829.
Tell me, now, if persistence is not a virtue?”
“That is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,” said the cardinal, with a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort of esteem; “remain free, then, and guard your hatreds and your sympathies.”
“You annoyed, count?” said Beauchamp; “and by what?”
“What’s the matter?” asked Planchet.
He was a clever man.
There was a moment’s silence, during which the noise of the banker’s pen was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling.
“Shall we not know it?”
Well, if so, why do you object to my doing so?”
“Good day, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis; “believe me, I am glad to see you.”
“Well, then, let us go—I must trust to you.”
“But as you spoke to him you must have seen him.”
The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said, “I swear to your majesty.”
But when he saw the carriage take the way to La Grêve, when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville, and the carriage passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him.
Planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and placed his knee upon his breast.
“That is the most just remark,” replied the stranger, “I ever heard made concerning myself.”
“Well, what is the matter, my dear?” asked the gentleman whose name the lady’s agitation revealed; “tell me what is the matter.”
“Well, my dear Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “that’s the very thing it came into my head to do.”
“To prevent recognition,” said D’Artagnan.
“My first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for defense, it might at least serve for expiation.
then tell me who you are, and get along with you upon your journey,” replied the duchess, with the gayety which made her so charming, “for I am sufficiently in bad odor already, without compromising myself still more.”
“But if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?”
“The devil he is!” said Porthos.
“I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been here.
How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions?” asked the beadle.
At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard.
“Good news!
He had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger, who appeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a moment to lose.
Render to him, then, the last service he can by any possibility ask of you, and your work will be all the more meritorious.”
And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a looking-glass.
“Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us.
“And what crime has he committed?”
Étienne soon returned from his errand.
Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julia, and Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides, the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle.
“To the king.”
Port Wine.
“At Saint Mande.”
I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all, I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo,—and certainly that illustrious personage, apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one, delight in solving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to the Bois behind your horses.
“Well, but what else could you play for?
“Go, young men!
“I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to explain.”
Aramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it, his countenance radiant.
I present them; but my correspondent has disappeared.
I always suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something to diseased minds.
“A man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell?” said Mazarin.
“Four hundred and seventy-five livres,” said D’Artagnan, who reckoned like Archimedes.
That little compliment could not fail to move D’Artagnan.
Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person; like her sister the queen, she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen; she resolved, therefore, to seek hospitality of the priest.”
You didn’t know King Charles; to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him.”
Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival, when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes.
“On!
Again the abbé smiled.
“Four times two makes eight,” then said Aramis; “it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have already the saddles.”
When we went up to the enemy it was slowly; we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards, who were on a height with lowered muskets.
All eyes were turned towards this man—for to all except Athos he was unknown.
D’Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry.
“Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!” Morrel repeated.
“Madame,” cried the cardinal, seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back, “Madame, what are you about?”
And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not precisely loved.
“‘Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies.’”
A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and making a violent effort over himself, he said: “I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation.
And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off; his regiment, which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth, from the name of his archbishopric, darted after him and began the fight.
Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.
“Your Excellency is safe and sound?” asked the host.
“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place.
“Oh!
It is my soul that must be saved; as for my body, it is lost.”
“Two poniards, a knotted rope and a poire d’angoisse.” *
“But your future career, D’Artagnan—your ambition, Porthos?”
“Athos!” cried the two Musketeers.
“If his Eminence,” said he, “did not have personal motives—”
The young girl shook her head.
D’Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then returned to Milady.
“And will you sign the contract?”
The four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may well be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the ear on the hark.
Take care, my young friend.
This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me; besides, he is a turbulent fellow, who will ruin our party.
“Yesterday morning, madame.”
Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard.
Danglars threw himself upon his goat-skin, and Peppino, reclosing the door, again began eating his peas and bacon.
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling.
“I shrink before nothing but impossibilities.”
Skirmishing.
Those must have been ten weary years.”
“What would you have?” said D’Artagnan.
“Yes, sir,” replied Mousqueton.
Milady does not know me; I will get access to her without her suspecting me, and when I catch my beauty, I will strangle her.”
The doctors, anxious for my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples.
“All’s well,” he cried, as he entered; “I have hired a cedar wherry, as light as a canoe, as easy on the wing as any swallow.
“Go and fetch it.”
“Seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs.”
“Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,” was the answer.
“Oh, yes; that is indispensable.
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised.
They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned me.
“What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?” cried the cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother, stooping down to the height of the coach window.
“And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort.
“What was the matter with you, Hermine?
“And where does he come from?” asked Debray.
“Well, you rascal, what is it?
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy.
“But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection.
“Who talks of God and despair at the same time?” said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance, sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man’s ears.
I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner, a friend of the Duc de Beaufort, who called for help.
Why did you deceive me?
“Then,” resumed he, “mad, desperate, determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.
Suspicion instantly seized me.
Nevertheless, D’Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him.
Well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph.
“Tomorrow—immediately—when you please!”
“Sign it, then.”
“Yes,” replied Mme.
How convenient that there’s a bench here.
“You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?” the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf.
“And Monsieur leaves me here alone?”
“I am listening, madame, with the greatest interest,” said Mazarin.
A thunder of applause saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.
I am older than your eminence, although I possess not your wisdom.
Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here—that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds.”
On the following morning at five o’clock D’Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help, asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother’s recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor, D’Artagnan walked about that same evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.
“My dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my life.”
“They are soldiers, though,” resumed De Bragelonne.
From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life, spending both income and principal.
But to return to the charming musicians—you should give us a treat, Danglars, without telling them there is a stranger.
So no more delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you, I swear by my faith as an honest man—” and at these words D’Artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation.
“Planchet, my friend,” said Porthos, in a melancholy voice, “I am very ill; should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me.”
Faria had dug his way through fifty feet, Dantès would dig a hundred; Faria, at the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was but half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant, had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands—Daume, Rattonneau, or Lemaire; should a hardy sailor, an experienced diver, like himself, shrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere amusement’s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project?
The yard was empty; the clock was striking twelve.
“Ah, yes, I see,” said the cardinal; “we must be discreet with this sort of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and you know I have taken orders.”
“Edmond Dantès,” replied the magistrate, “I arrest you in the name of the law!”
Athos, look at Mordaunt’s smile.
At the hour agreed upon Groslow came.
D’Artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner’s hand, saying:
“I am not aware of it,” said Albert, smiling sorrowfully.
Ere long Marseilles presented herself to view,—Marseilles, white, fervid, full of life and energy,—Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre and Carthage, the successor to them in the empire of the Mediterranean,—Marseilles, old, yet always young.
“Yes, monsieur, I must.”
Disarm him only—make sure of his sword.
“Ah!
Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did Albert’s declaration.
“Now, then,” said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, “I must have another!”
But,” he went on with his peculiar smile, “I am here in Paris, and have plenty of time before me—by and by will do for that.”
“The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson & French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I paid him with checks on the bank.
“You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and are accused of high treason.”
Go, Edward, and see.”
“‘Yes; do stay,’ added La Carconte in a tremulous voice; ‘we will take every care of you.’
Alas!
But to avoid risk, put the pistols in the holsters.
Why should they?
It was precisely at this moment that M. de Tréville, on leaving the residence of the _lieutenant-criminel_ and the governor of Fort l’Evêque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.
I might have suspected he was poisoning us.”
He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d’Or.
And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D’Artagnan, who instantly put himself at the head of his troop, followed by the cardinal, Guitant and the rest of the escort.
“Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?”
“The affair at Armentieres?” asked he again.
Mme.
“Then, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king’s Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me.”
The famous secretaire is in the dressing-room.”
Chapter LXXXVIII.
“Have you had any account of it?”
And the queen?”
One day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercédès, and the poor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console him, he said to her,—‘Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and instead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy, for I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.’
“That was an oversight, certainly,” replied the count; “but tell me, does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera?
“I do not know.”
“I must have been blind not to have seen.”
“Willingly, if you wish it.”
“Meaning to say,” rejoined Monte Cristo, “that however Thomson & French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.”
“And how do you make your twelve thousand francs?
Villefort continued:
our dear count!” said D’Artagnan.
“Excuse me, sir,” said Franz, “since M. Noirtier sent for me, I am ready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay my respects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.”
“Well, now that everything is decided,” cried Porthos, rubbing his hands, “suppose we think of dinner!
At this moment Aramis, aroused by this unusual disturbance, cautiously opened the door of his room; and Blaisois, looking reproachfully at the Cerberus, drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis.
And the edicts?
“Ah, my time is not valuable,” replied the man with a melancholy smile.
In fact, looking at the place to which Athos pointed, D’Artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop.
These horses are equipped for the field.
“Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?”
The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor.
“Have you so soon changed your mind,” added Morcerf, “or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled?”
“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened?
“Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?”
“But how could you have these fish brought to France?”
“Sir,” said De Winter, “I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution; withdraw, then, or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in London.
Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing—the cries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage.
All my researches have been useless.
“But can you not say that, sir?
“The cardinal’s?” cried D’Artagnan, breaking into a loud laugh, he having heard, as may be remembered, thanks to the broken boards, every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife.
The Project Gutenberg eBook of Twenty Years After
In an instant, and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in their turn, appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back.
Jesus Seigneur!”
It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers.
But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face expressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty.
“Now, understand me,” said the count, “no direct questions, my dear Morcerf; if you wish to know anything, tell me, and I will ask her.”
I will allow myself to die with hunger.’
“Un vent de fronde S’est leve ce matin; Je crois qu’il gronde Contre le Mazarin.
What do you say, Athos, to that proposition?
“How strong and courageous you are!” said the fair, frail girl to her brunette companion.
I could have drunk fifty bottles more.”
Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was like people who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.
“No,” said Athos.
She was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar.
“Dead!” repeated a third voice.
“A count, and a rich one too, eh?”
“Exordium,” repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.
“Indeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment.
He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugénie.”
“Then, in order not to hinder you, I will get up with you if you please in your carriage, and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow.”
I was concealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place.
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she resolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward.
D’Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal’s arms.
The count watched him.
The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: “Has Madame Bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person?
The time for wine came.
“I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf’s, among the rest; she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy.
“I am free, then, sir?” cried Dantès joyfully.
“You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.”
“His family will care much about such a trifle as that!
“The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,—I ask no more.”
“RICHELIEU”
I can manage your business for you.
“It was the fever that disturbed you, madame,” said Villefort.
“But he wears my livery; my livery will be known,” replied Porthos.
Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her native place.
From the ends of these two wings extended the park.
As to his going or staying, I feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions; he shall do what he wishes to do.”
“Don’t let us disarrange your eminence.
“‘To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath the packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document.’
There exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you.
“To no one.
Then he resumed in his turn: “Discipline, Monseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us.
Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day.
“Diavolo!
The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf, according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars.
“We have not thought about it yet, madame,” answered D’Artagnan, with that Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete; “but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly.”
“I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do so.
“Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?”
“Would it be to give up Broussel, sir?
Let me see.
Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.
“In that case Porthos will assist us.”
“Oh, sire,” replied the minister, “we have no occasion to invent any; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations, coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.”
“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied Edmond.
“Well, no, madame,—this is the terrible news I have to tell you,” said Villefort in a hollow voice—“no, nothing was found beneath the flowers; there was no child disinterred—no.
“You are not a woman,” said Athos, coldly and sternly.
“Well, how has all gone off?”
“Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!”
The man remained in the village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her journey.
“The king!” they exclaimed, as all rose in bewilderment.
“What will you?
D’Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather this apparition—for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision—was Mme.
“Let us put down 120,” added Albert, smiling.
“Really, this is frightful.”
“Ah!
“Shall we see you again to give us any information?” inquired the countess.
“Hasten, reverend sir, hasten!
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” repeated Louis; “very well, madame.”
“That’s well,” said D’Artagnan.
But the rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone man, were he Hercules himself.
“Five or six thousand men.”
“As to supper,” replied the landlord, “you shall be served immediately; but as for the carriage——”
“Ah, yes, where is my sister?” asked the prince.
“Ah!
“Silence!” said a hollow voice.
Has Bedeau been killed?
“No.
What!” he continued, “can I have been following a false path?—can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?—can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious, undertaking?
Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart.
The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted skill.
“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the _Pharaon_ without a captain.”
“Ah, wretch!” cried she, “you have basely betrayed me, and still more, you have my secret!
But it is not the less true that that letter—”
The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion.
“You do?
“And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.
“Do you know, sir, these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds?”
20312m
This man, whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others, was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty.
“Why, what ails you?” asked he of Edmond.
A Conjugal Scene Chapter 66.
“To ask me if I want money.”
“Indeed!” said D’Artagnan; “I am most unhappy to hear it, on account of those fine animals.”
“That Gascon!” cried Mazarin, with well acted surprise.
“Yes, yes, Dantès’ good health!” said Caderousse, emptying his glass, “here’s to his health!
no!
“At what hour shall we come?” asked the young man.
“To the devil!” answered D’Artagnan.
“My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland; and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty debated.”
Ah, there he is calling me now.
I am not obliged to read any breviary.
It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the name of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the thirty-first the name of Aramis.
“This secret, Aramis, does not belong to us; take my advice, then, and let no one into our confidence.
At five o’clock Anne went to the cardinal’s room.
No!
He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables, and he placed them at the queen’s disposal.
“If you need money, my lord, separate the jewels I have given you; detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew.
Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive at London.”
“Bank-notes!”
“Good heavens, what are you telling me?”
“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions.
“Be satisfied, my reverend father, I can answer for myself.”
Then came a skirmish, the more terrible because it had no definite object; the more melancholy, because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting.
The game began.
The Swiss became as purple as a peony.
“Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M. Andrea—at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.”
You will find mine on my saddle, already loaded.”
“He has escaped by this means,” exclaimed he.
She must have a long arm.”
“Pardon me,” said Albert, “I was not aware that he was a prince.
“Believe me, dear Albert,” he said, with all the emotion he was capable of feeling,—“believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in any way I can serve you, I am yours.”
“And who thus designated it?”
“You will follow these men and not lose sight of them; when you have discovered where they lodge, come and await me at the town gate.”
“Come hither,” said Mazarin in his softest voice; “I have an order to give you.”
If Mazarin is an Italian, I am a Gascon.”
“At Charenton, in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of Paris.”
They entered, for the door was not locked—there is much confidence among villagers.
Villefort returned, and d’Avrigny met him in the passage.
Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again.
This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as the ball was not of the regular caliber.
“Ah, that’s true!
Aramis’s searching look seemed to seek his friend’s thought even at the bottom of his heart, but D’Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity.
And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth.
‘If he should really be guilty,’ said he, ‘and did really put in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this letter upon him, those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices.’ I confess I had my fears, in the state in which politics then were, and I held my tongue.
“No,” replied Athos; “and he——”
“The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.”
“Perhaps,” said Athos; “But at all events listen well to this.
“I tell you so to prove to you that I still hope.”
Lay him down here; we’ll gag him and tie him—no matter where—somewhere.
“Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?”
At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed.
He could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of Meung, “Tell me,” continued he, “had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?”
and Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M. de Château-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, eight.”
“Friends!” said Athos, “do you regret you have not shed our blood?”
Fate is not more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary, overcome fate.
“It is—but you will not look, will you?—it is because they have had the axe, with which criminals are executed, brought and placed there on the table.
As, however, he did not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away toward the hôtel of M. de la Trémouille, in whose service he had a relative, D’Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the friends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with D’Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell upon the conqueror.
“It belongs to one of our companions, who is overtaking us.”
“Wait a minute longer, and I will introduce him to you.”
“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor.
“Tell the count that I am well; that you found me sad, but resigned.”
Oh, I have been base, cowardly, I tell you; I have abjured my affections, and like all renegades I am of evil omen to those who surround me!”
“I sometimes wonder,” replied Athos, smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days, “that we could form an association of men who would be, after twenty years of separation, still so closely bound together.
“I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot accept it, Edmond—my son would not permit it.”
“Yes, the idea was yours.
She was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the _Cremona Violin_, she would die one day while singing.
In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise D’Artagnan’s vigilance.
“And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,” said Debray.
Uncle and Nephew.
At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air, and the two travelers could see, displayed in all their brilliancy, the large eyes, the vermilion visage, and the eloquent smile of—Mousqueton.
Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions.
“Do you think they have recognized us?” said D’Artagnan.
“I shall get nothing from these fools,” he muttered; “and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward.
“He is there!
“Yes, but for to-night’s adventure I don’t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one.
Aramis easily aroused Athos, whose sleep was light, like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution.
“You live alone, then?”
The Battle of Charenton.
“Is Mazarin dead?” asked Porthos.
The count’s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he stepped forward, and touching the young man’s shoulder, said:
“To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world; but you will not do so, I hope.
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M. d’Artagnan, who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms of his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and threaten.
“So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate.”
It was scarcely eleven o’clock in the morning, and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Tréville, who could not fail to think the manner in which D’Artagnan had left him a little cavalier.
“Then make yourself quite easy.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the cardinal, sitting down on a fauteuil, “you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man.”
“I have taken from you one _carte blanche_ to give you another.
Poor fellow!
“Yesterday I was at your house, sir,” said the young man; “because then I knew not who you were.”
de Saint-Méran, whose sole heiress I am.
Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted.
_“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”_ Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied.
A ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of the dead.
I never play, for I am not rich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently poor to desire to gain.
The favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish posterity.
As to Porthos—oh, as to Porthos, faith, that’s a droll affair!”
Athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created, read aloud:
Her face, as she looked at Athos, had taken on an expression that cannot be described.
His insolent bravery, his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which he had climbed four steps at a time.
The young woman hastened to meet him.
But to the great astonishment of D’Artagnan, the shutter remained closed.
You were no stranger to me, for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted.
“I depend upon your word, my Lord.”
She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps.
“Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?”
“No, everyone would do that.”
There was a postscript:
[27] Guilbert de Pixérécourt, French dramatist (1773-1844).
Danglars retreated a few steps.
I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment.
And the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.
“Because, as they say in the opera of ‘Thisbe,’ ‘The whole world conspires to break our bonds.’”
“I do not wish to be taken by surprise,” added the king.
30011m
The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency.
The principal charge against you is this letter, and you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited until it was entirely consumed.

M. d’Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.”
“Yes; those who have died of hunger.”

But, devil take him!
“Am I, indeed, so happy?” said Albert, who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow.
Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat, where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated, reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends, who were intoxicated with joy.
The weak man talks of burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor of treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his pride, calls himself Jupiter.

Didn’t you see that Monsieur d’Artagnan mounted with difficulty?
“Oh, ours is a theological quarrel,” replied Aramis, making a sign to D’Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.
“I have already forbidden that man,” he said, “to come in here without my permission.”
“Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable.”
So the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping-room; and one by one the lights in the salon of the Rue des Tournelles were extinguished.

“Here, or in the neighborhood.”
“I have been in ill-luck for several days,” said Danglars, “and I have heard nothing but bad news.”

Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the _impresari_; I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre, who is under some obligation to me.
“Alas!” said Kitty, “for whom have I exposed myself to all that?”
“No.”
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards; that is to say, soldiers.

In the meantime, as we have said, Mazarin was in his closet, putting his affairs in order.
It was now nine o’clock.
“Whom do you mean?”
People fight for all sorts of reasons, you know.”

Unlike other men, who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches, the Duc de Beaufort, whose buoyant courage had become a proverb, seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action.

“Oh, my wound—mine—’tis nothing,” replied the viscount; “it will be time to think about it when we next halt; only have the goodness, should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant, to tell him, in fact, that you have seen me, but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at Mazingarbe and to stop at Cambrin.

“I?—I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha.
Die, impenitent, die in despair, die and be damned!” And drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man, saying, “Here is my absolution!”

“Oh, I confess it is all the same to me.”
It was like a besieged town.
This did not take long.

“And when do you set out?”
private secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to protect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battle-fields with his sword and his victories; possessing five-and-twenty thousand francs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you would not part with; a tailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the jockey-club, and other diversions, can you not amuse yourself?

As he was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos’s long cloak, and D’Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it.
Are you going?”
No longer could Edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed.

The cardinal could not keep up with them, though with every wish to do so.
Oh, M. d’Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!”
Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugénie to the opera.

Franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfred’s shoulders, or beneath Lara’s helmet.

“And who is the man?”
After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage, sheathing on the way his now useless sword, and thus reached the neighboring house, where he paused to examine himself and to take breath.

“You have decided, friend?” said Athos.
After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby, the count took Albert’s arm.

“Doctor d’Avrigny,” said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall.
Athos glanced at Aramis.
Go, then, and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me.
“Heyday!” cried D’Artagnan, “what matters it to me, after all, if Cromwell, who’s an Englishman, revolts against his king, who is a Scotchman?
“He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling _incog_.”
The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture, turned towards Monte Cristo and said,—“Upon my word, count, I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner.

“More intrigues!
“Will you assure me it shall not be signed?”

“Did you doubt it!”
“That is possible—go.”
I confess myself conquered.
The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramis’s face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain; but quick as it was, it did not escape D’Artagnan’s observation.
“And previously, where were you?”
Athos gave Raoul some of the holy water.
M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed.
“One more turn, captain; twenty pistoles on one throw—only one, the last.”
Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to the garden.
If they had discovered Milady’s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth was to return to Béthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide to the four friends.
But what raised public astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance, was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the Allées de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman’s hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years.
“Because you would bring us to ruin.”
The count read it.
D’Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de Tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D’Artagnan had received from the Duke of Buckingham.
“Adieu, Monsieur de Rochefort,” he said.
“Tell me who this man was!” cried the young officer.
“You,” he said, “you, who are so trusting, read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see.”
“Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough.
Chapter LIII.
M. Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.
“What the devil could that handkerchief signify?”
“I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will be ready.”
The slightest rustling of the foliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and drew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder, and, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step.
Felton made no resistance.
I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me.
“‘Oh, no,’ answered Caderousse, ‘that was not my reason, I can assure you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.’
Well yes, you are right; that name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly.
The Challenge Chapter 88.
This was the inspector’s first visit; he wished to display his authority.
“Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you?”
you do not give us a day—no, not even an hour before your departure?”
Alas!
“Where is M. de Villefort?”
Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any, Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her instructions.
The halberds were for the audience in the rear; the muskets are for us.”
“Did you not see his face?” asked Athos.
“‘Yes, yes, my lord; don’t be uneasy.’
“Agreed, as to the old Burgundy; I have no objection to that,” said Aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his ideas of conversion.
He cast a rapid glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.
He folded up the accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureur’s advice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on the throne) the services Dantès had rendered to the imperial cause—services which Villefort’s certificates rendered indisputable.
Médéah was standing at the rack, eating his hay.
In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to the tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the daughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and Edward, the boy whose life you have this day saved.”
“Always tell me everything,” said Maximilian with a smile.
But you, D’Artagnan, what is the matter with you, and what has happened to you personally?
Albert followed him with the count.
He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities.
“Please your honors,” said the host, “a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you.”
He was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill, but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols.
“And who is Beppo?”
“Yes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so effectually.”
D’Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon.
“I have sailed over it since my childhood.”
As soon as there was room for rowing, his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly.
Do you grasp that?” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; “the daughter of Henry IV.
“Still you must breakfast somewhere.”
M. de Villefort was therefore obliged to request M. d’Avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances.
At this cry Andrea raised his head.
“Yes; but only to take a little rosewood casket, with her cipher upon it, and went out again immediately.”
And M. Bonacieux, whom D’Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him?
The only question was, had she ten or twelve?
They passed through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into an elegantly fitted-up drawing-room.
“Yes, he used to drink a great deal,” replied Porthos.
“Name a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my friends.”
“Sir,” continued Villefort, “there is something to fear besides death, old age, and madness.
“For the barricades.
“‘To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!’
“Well, are you coming?” asked Albert.
They did not dare to ask him how he had slept.
“She will escape us,” replied the young man; “she will escape us, and it will be your fault, Athos.”
I wish that this event, which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs, should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself, myself, and a third person.”
“His excellency’s horses!”
D’Artagnan leaned against the hedge, after having cast a glance behind it.
Many citizens, seeing the women flying toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open doors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps toward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered, increasing every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of curiosity.
Chapter VII.
“Unhappy man!” cried Grimaud, whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause; “unhappy man, you named no one, I hope?”
“You speak very much at your ease, madame,” said Bonacieux, hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him.
“And now,” he said, “may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me?”
“I could interpret one of your looks.”
Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit.
Still, let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily infliction of his peevish partner’s murmurs and lamentations.
“Oh, yes, certainly,” said the count; “uniform, cross, knee-breeches.”
On my word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is worth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation for the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise?
“Well, sir,” asked Franz, “what do you wish me to do with this paper?”
I had about a million in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago.”
“Oh, no, never,” said Planchet, “I will never leave Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
“Really impossible!
Just as he was passing the count’s box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo came forth.
If you know, why don’t you tell?”
The counsels of his friend, joined to the cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again.
It was the way in which he spoke.
“Come, come,” said Monte Cristo, “confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson & French.
“Here it is.”
“But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.”
Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post; but at that instant a treble voice, proceeding from a kind of entresol, was heard screeching:
“Well, come; set to.”
“What shall I do with Albert?
He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present.
His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with trembling.
“Ah!” said Porthos, “let us hear what he says.”
M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down again, silent and motionless.
“Yes, I.”
excellency, the evil has arrived!”
But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil:
If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
I was forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning.
Mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life—that of standing behind a gilded carriage.
“Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend?
“Well, well!
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the superior.
Then turning to the young man he exclaimed:
“No; we heard, I think, the sound of her _guzla_, but she remained perfectly invisible.”
The traveler made a sign of assent.
Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of pincette.
“Cæsar’s _Commentaries_,” said the bandit, “it is my favorite work.”
D’Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase, soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out.
“As for that, M. Morrel,” said he, again turning his quid, “as for that——”
“Oh, count, what a service you might render me!
I confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.
Let Monsieur Grimaud go in, Monsieur Mouston.”
ha!” answered Porthos, “behold, other players appear.”
3, 1627
“Order of the king,” he said.
Come, take a little oath for me on the cross; I won’t ask anything more of you.’
“Pshaw!” said Busoni disdainfully; “poverty may make a man beg, steal a loaf of bread at a baker’s door, but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited.
The news of the arrival of the _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.
D’Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.
Without you I was a dead man—thrice dead.”
Although apparently not noticing Albert, he did not, however, lose sight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act, he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends.
I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights—that would be to accuse Her Majesty, Queen Anne, of falsehood.”
“Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine!
“Bah!
“It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.”
“I hope,” said D’Artagnan, bowing, “that you give it, my lord, without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of it.”
“Get on it; that’s it, friend.”
“Pray, are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury?”
Oh, how happy you make us!
“The executioner of Lille, the executioner of Lille!” cried Milady, a prey to insensate terror, and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling.
since, in our romance of “The Three Musketeers,” we took leave of D’Artagnan at No.
You are not angry with me?”
Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the outline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish.
Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed.
“If you do not go, sir,” said De Guiche, “remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be; and then I swear your trial will be summary; one can always find a tree and a cord.”
“There can be no doubt about it,” thought he; “it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom.
“Speak, madame!” resumed Mme.
Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the smoking horses, and put the carriage into a coach house.
“At Thirsk,” replied Harrison.
“Yes, do you know how we are situated?
D’Artagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting, and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water, he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure.
“Four men traveling together would be suspected.
“Tell me the name of that generous friend,” said the king, “that I may cherish for him an eternal gratitude, whether he succeeds or not.”
Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was obliged to support himself against the wall.
The cabinet of M. de Tréville, generally held so sacred, became in an instant the annex of the antechamber.
“What?—although you are not now going to be married, you intend still——”
“Does that alarm you?” cried D’Artagnan.
“Very good; have what time you require, Dantès.
“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.
“Yes,” said Athos, “it reminds me of a family jewel.”
“Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer.
“Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you.”
“Ah!
“Tears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing.
Monte Cristo turned to Albert.
D’Artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter.
“Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot you and M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be recompensed.”
Penelon had, it would seem, made good use of his money, for he was newly clad.
“You look like four conspirators.”
Ah,” cried Milady and Rochefort together, “it is you!”
Athos smiled.
“Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?”
Porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of the king.
The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès; she pressed her son’s hand and sobbed aloud, but her tears relieved her.
“Yes; come and pass the night with me.”
Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister; and besides,” she added, her eyes troubled and moistened with tears, “wait, wait, Fernand; you said just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four months, and during these four months there have been some terrible storms.”
When they arrived at the Madeleine:
Upon which M. d’Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son, kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.
0073m
However, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him.
Ho, there, boy!
“I am, indeed, rejoiced,” said Andrea.
“Well?” said the baroness.
“Assassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I demand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I will execute it myself.”
Another nod on the part of Grimaud.
D’Artagnan called the sergeant.
“’Tis God who gives them into our hands,” answered Groslow.
“Three hundred livres?
“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria.
M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth.
“Do you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother?
At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open.”
In the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter; there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed, misrepresented, metamorphosed, some into epigrams, some into falsehoods, that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron, listening to what he said, reporting it to others.
“But wait.
de Morcerf,’ said the president, ‘do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina?’—‘No,’ said Morcerf, attempting to rise, ‘it is a base plot, contrived by my enemies.’ Haydée, whose eyes had been fixed on the door, as if expecting someone, turned hastily, and, seeing the count standing, shrieked, ‘You do not know me?’ said she.
The queen breathed more freely.
“Sinbad the Sailor?” he said.
“That’s it,” replied Athos, becoming almost livid; “that is my grand story of the fair lady, and when I relate that, I must be very drunk.”
“Besides,” said D’Artagnan, “pardon me, madame, if, guardsman as I am, I remind you of prudence—besides, I believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences.
“Duke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written to.”
“No, no!” cried Mazarin, fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement.
The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers.
“Well, no, not very.”
Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny, saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended, but in three months it should be repeated, when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks.
Excuse me, excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,—a deposit which I promised to pay this morning.”
At daybreak D’Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be done.
He preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library than parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments, in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according to his valet de chambre.
Ask him then, for the written order.
d’Artagnan, of the king’s Guards, company Dessessart, is expected at the Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight o’clock.
“Five hundred paces.”
Advancing a few steps toward the queen, he knelt down.
“Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris?” she inquired.
He would no longer be alone.
The child went directly to him without kissing his mother.
devil’s coachman!” cried Friquet, “you’re meddling too!
At the branching off of the road toward Paris, Aramis, who had followed in the cardinal’s suite, turned back.
Meanwhile, to his great regret, as he said, he was obliged to keep his bed.
At six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny himself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away.
It was a strange thing, and one which made D’Artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft light, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder.
0191m
“Why not?”
My funds are deposited there, and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor.
Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech, which showed that she had taken the minister’s proposal seriously.
“Why?”
“Nay, I know not; some evidence required from us, perhaps.”
“There are no extravagant hopes but for fools, monsieur, and you are a man of understanding.
But are you well assured, sir?”
The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light.
Valentine
“Ah!
The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner.
“Not a step further,” he shouted, “the queen is signing!”
After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
“Well, very good; you will do as much when the opportunity occurs, will you, Raoul?”
“Perfectly safe and sound.”
“I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.”
0147m
Athos followed them, then Porthos, then Aramis.
“What for?” asked Eugénie.
As for Monte Cristo, his head was bent down, his arms were powerless.
“My present happiness equals my past misery,” said the count.
It is a little worse for the journey, but that’s no matter.”
“No, Monsieur Jester,” replied D’Artagnan; “but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to find them living.”
30041m
“Come, Raoul,” he said, “let us follow this man.”
“Adieu, then.” And D’Artagnan poured out a glass of wine.
“Come, gentlemen, come!” said D’Artagnan, aloud; “I have no motive for defending Monsieur.
“Ah!
The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened; the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array.
“Ah!” said the abbé, in a peculiar tone, “he is happy.”
“Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.”
“He has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dovecot.”
“When I last drew my poniard.”
“Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,” continued Maximilian.
It is useless to let the cardinal know.”
“Are you sure of it?”
Other turnkeys came, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers.
The instant the letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to find a messenger.
“What diabolical villainy you have performed here,” said Porthos, when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone.
Mme.
There only remained three things to decide—what they should write to Milady’s brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters.
He hastened to his cabinet.
is that you, dear friend?” exclaimed Porthos.
At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit his lips.
“As calm as at parade, radiant as at a fete.
Are there, then, really women who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in Byron’s poems?”
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have everything he wanted.
Well, just as you like, my prince; there’s liberty for all the world.
“Then,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “they have again discovered the secret of the famous _aqua Tofana_ that they said was lost at Perugia.”
I gave her good advice, by which she did not profit.
She was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that heaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.
No, in truth you are no visionary, my dear friend, and now I think of it—you—yes, i’faith, you’re right—those delicate, yet firm-set lips, those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart!
“Back already!
ah!
“Well, yes, pretty well,” replied D’Artagnan; “and besides, you see, if they put us on trial, if they cut off our heads, they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere.”
“Very rich, do you think?” replied the young man.
“And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voiture’s works, but I am of the same opinion as the coadjutor—he is a poet, a true poet.” Aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody.
“I threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear upon my brow.
“I shall then have no more friends,” said the young man.
“Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant?”
I could, therefore, expect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne?
“Yes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less.
The coadjutor possessed, perhaps, as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him.
Albert, who was a great smoker, and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_.
By the way——”
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds.
“As many thousands as you give me hundreds!
He consented.
The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal’s people.
I will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he keep his word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an officer, or dead.
“Strong, thinkest thou?”
He rushed toward D’Artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms.
D’Artagnan saw from the expression of the queen’s face that she was about to issue some violent command.
At court, provided you have ever the honor to go there,” continued M. d’Artagnan the elder, “—an honor to which, remember, your ancient nobility gives you the right—sustain worthily your name of gentleman, which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years, both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you.
‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo, who is now, I believe, in Paris?’
I could make of that subject two volumes the size of this,” continued the Jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio, which made the table bend beneath its weight.
“I wore an enormous cloak,” said Aramis.
“I come for your commands, my lord,” he said.
“Yes, sir.” said Mordaunt.
Impossible!” said Château-Renaud; “only ten days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband?”
It was said that Madame de Longueville, for whom the prince had more than a brother’s affection and in whom he had confided, had been indiscreet.
You will deliver this letter to Milady.
“‘True, but that makes no difference.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” he cried, falling back a step; “it is Monsieur d’Artagnan!
“Well,” said the banker to his daughter, “are we then all to be excluded?”
Go.”
“Is this carriage for us?” asked Milady.
“Now, what?” asked Porthos.
“By your father’s tomb!” said Caderousse, supported by a supernatural power, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred; “who, then, are you?”
And he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the corridor, the soldier’s half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted guard in his place.
“No, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal.”
“I do not know who could if I could not,” said Caderousse.
“Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian—too rich?
• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering.
“Undeniably.”
“If you have it, use it,” replied Gondy.
It was a Béarn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his legs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day.
“Why not?”
“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_ arrived today—why, you understand!”
D’Artagnan had, with his sword, cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed.
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks, fixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair.
You have not returned that visit, and you were wrong.”
He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for D’Artagnan, and Grimaud obeyed as usual.
“Oh, you love her still,” said Kitty, who had not taken her eyes off the young man’s countenance for an instant.
“I will follow you.
“I presume that she has returned to Tours.”
All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert.
“Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”
Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the scene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and shower down confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers.
There she made a fresh sign of silence, and opened a second door concealed by tapestry.
“Comte de Rochefort.”
Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes.
“Is she, then, preparing for a stroke?”
“I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.”
“Dear Albert,” said Beauchamp.
Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story.
“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”
“Come here, my lad,” said La Ramee, “and hear what I have to say.”
Courage!
“Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know, think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel.
For my part, I should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles.
“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”
“It concerns the best interests of your father,” said the messenger.
His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard, no matter for whom or against whom.
D’Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.
It is true also, that as I did not then know his Eminence, if I had been able to dispense with the visit, I should have been enchanted.”

The house belonged, as the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran, Villefort’s father-in-law.
Bazin followed him upon a roan, holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was D’Artagnan’s mount.
When, the day after the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughter’s hand for you, I decidedly refused him, but without any explanation or exposure.
Felton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and listening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a man awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.
The cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention; then, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.

Four in the king’s room, two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered.
Oh, do not say so; it will break my resolutions.”
In another hour every light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept.
No news had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis.
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady; but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning.
What was all that to Scarron?
“When you like, Raoul.”
Cocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the anteroom, and seated himself.

“But you promised me—” whispered the poor mercer.
Buckingham threw himself at her feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her robe.
I am so unhappy.”
Villefort could not believe his eyes,—he could not believe his reason; he dragged himself towards the child’s body, and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub.
M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the open door with his servant.
Dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor did he think of it now.
“To M. Franz d’Épinay?”
“If, God willing, these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence,” said D’Artagnan, “I shall venture to express a wish, which is, that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy—for with these three men your eminence may rouse all Europe if you like.”
“You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear you shall die by my hand.”
D’Artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road, followed by Planchet at the same pace.
It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth.”
Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile: “Poor wretch, for half a crown he would do as much to his own father.”
Besides, the eyes of the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of seeing in the dark.
“Ah!” thought Porthos, “the man Aramis wants me to strangle.”
“Once under my grandfather’s roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness; in that case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands.
Porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder.
“How did you know about it?”
Those who have read the _Memoirs_ of Mme.
Athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to Grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that he was to stand as sentinel.
Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath.”
Monsieur Porthos!” cried the procurator’s wife.
You have not played for a long time, I said; you ought, then, to have a good hand.”
He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier.
It is well known how violent the king’s prejudices were against the queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal, who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.
Totally disregarding the business of the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.
“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”
“No, sir, with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him; he had no means of resistance.”
“My Lord, they shall be yours.”
From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd; projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard, the echo of which, though they were probably fired in the air, made all hearts vibrate.
“Yes, I insist.”
“Well?” continued she.
“Wretch!” exclaimed Aramis, raising his pistol as he passed by him; but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off.
remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:
“Why,” he said, “does he enter without first asking for an audience?”
Do you think it will be long before he comes in?”
But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it, and how?—by a murder!
“Ah, sir!” answered Raoul, “you joke about a real misfortune; that is cruel, indeed.”
“My dear friend,” said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, “do I ever read the papers?”
That little stout man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes, treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort, was Bonacieux himself.
“If what you say is sincere,” replied Athos, “he will never reach London.”
“Madame,” he said to the duchess, “I have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you; it has succeeded, since you deign to receive me.
“Because,” said the old man, “the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty.
But M. de la Trémouille—already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as we already know, Bernajoux was—replied that it was neither for M. de Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him, whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to burn.
“A Russian do that?”
He was captured again, and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber, in which Ornano, Puylaurens, and his uncle had died.
“Well?”
“No; in that case they would have met with more fitting reward.
“How can he be the son of a great lord?”
“Do you hear?” said the king.

Everyone obeyed.
All at once he started.
The house was ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea.
We are no longer in the Middle Ages; there is no longer a Vehmgericht, or Free Tribunals; what do you want to ask these people?
Besides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady, after having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.
Franz adjusted his telescope, and directed it towards the yacht.
“Good-evening, comrade,” said D’Artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner.
Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!”
It was, indeed, the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass, and which Valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison, which could not deceive M. d’Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it was doubtless a miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her precautions, there should be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal the crime.
“What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog?” exclaimed Porthos.
“Zounds!” cried Aramis, “I may have done some good; so, my lord, deign to receive my most respectful homage!
“Good!” returned Peppino.
“For what reason is all this fume and fury?” asked Athos.
His interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years.
“[By telegraph.]
“I do not know.
“You should not have allowed him to go,” said the duke to Franz; “you, who know Rome better than he does.”
‘Well,’ asked the president, ‘what is your decision?’
“So much the better,” replied Monte Cristo; “as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by you.

You sustained me powerfully, sir, and I protest to you that to-day I feel very lonely.
“And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done?”

He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it, he mounted and galloped off in the direction of Paris.
“And I, too,” exclaimed Porthos.
“Very well, at one o’clock, then,” replied D’Artagnan, turning the angle of the street.
Returning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner, where it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.
Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury, screaming in a formidable way.
“Well, now you understand, mother!” continued Albert; “here are more than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two years.”
The Chancellor Sequier, who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly, stood before her, relating how his carriage had been smashed, how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel d’O——, that the hotel was immediately invaded, pillaged and devastated; happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry, in which he was secreted by an old woman, together with his brother, the Bishop of Meaux.
Then I admit my patience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to the charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let it pass through his body.
No matter.
Then he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it himself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.
“Now then,” said Andrea, while dressing himself, “I’ll wait till he leaves, and then I’ll slip away.”
“Think it?
Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness.
The queen, as he went on, looked at him with increasing astonishment.
I am something of a physician, and have, like my fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes, although present to my heart.
Oh, I repeat it, Edmond; what you have just done is beautiful—it is grand; it is sublime.”
“Pay him, booby!” cried the stranger to his servant, without checking the speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.
There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.”
They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad—and whom we have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title by which to distinguish him—gave some orders to the servant, Franz entered still another apartment.
He must now get his bearings.
“Oh, sir, in the most natural way possible,” replied he to whom they had given the title of count.
Cavalcanti’s father will be gone.”
“And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat everything.”
“Edward, you naughty boy,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching the mutilated book from the urchin’s grasp, “you are positively past bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier’s room.”
“Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?” said the major, endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty.
And she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined.
“Where are you going?” asked Dantès.
“To him who is called the Comte de la Fere.”
A few men, the least impressed of all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring this premature death, others expatiating on the grief of the father, and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall—until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the stanzas of Malherbe to Du Périer.
“Well,” said Milady, “what can those who sleep wish for—a happy awakening?
“And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other transaction of my life.
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “how glad I am to see you.”
“Bravo, Porthos!
And yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels.”
“Well!
I thought you had softened.

Jussac fell like a dead mass.
“Yes, sir” replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.
Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable companions.

A Florentine adventurer, sire, and that was all; while the august spouse of your Majesty is Anne of Austria, Queen of France—that is to say, one of the greatest princesses in the world.”
“Wait,” said Bazin, striking a flint, and setting afire a twisted wax-light, with which he started the church candles.
“That your lordship was about to treat with the court.”
“Well?” eagerly demanded all his three friends.
At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d’Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.
But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway.

Go, sir, go!”
“Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.”
Necessity has no law; besides, I am the person punished, as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least.
What do you mean by that, you idiot?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Excuse me,” said D’Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, “excuse me, but I am in a hurry.”
“Tomorrow, monsieur.”
“I killed one man, if I recollect rightly,” replied D’Artagnan, with a look of inquiry directed to Athos; “another I disarmed or wounded, I don’t remember which.”
“And why not?
Porthos looked at D’Artagnan with an expression of profound admiration.
Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la Fere.
“Too true, too true!” ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him, “the poor old man did die.”
The horses, which were more kindly used than on the previous day, stopped at Arras at four o’clock in the evening.
His companions, horror-struck, could neither move nor cry out.
Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise, that I may not commit an error.”
Porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile.
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton, whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace.
“Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the world, as they told me.
The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground.
The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls, partridges and hams with admirable skill.
“Well, be it so—let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte Cristo and M. Zaccone are the same——”
“Sir,” said the servant, “I have a favour to ask you.”
The traveller alighted, ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house of Thomson & French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one of the most celebrated in Rome.
The king asked to remain up, having, he said, no wish to sleep; but the queen was firm.
The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance.
Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle d’Armilly, of whom he had heard much.
The cardinal, therefore, got up, perfumed himself, dressed, and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him.
The comb was to be a leaden one, because his beard, like that of most fair people, was rather red; he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it.
“Yes,” added Planchet, “like the famous ass of Buridan.
At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress.
“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.”
But is not your eminence going to the queen?”
“Ah, that is true,” said De Guiche; “I had forgotten it.”
“And what did he say to you?”
From this moment I become your friend, and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in yours.”
“You?” said Madame Danglars.
“Fool!” cried Aramis; “knowest thou not, then, Mordaunt?

“_Che cosa?_” asked the bandit.
“Oh, sir, how good you are!”
“Here you can get anything you want; by paying for it, of course, as among honest folk.”
“I not only confess it, but am proud of it,” returned the Gascon; “I’m not such a rhinoceros as you are.
“‘The abbé told me it was worth 50,000 francs,’ muttered Caderousse.
The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message.
“No.”
“I told you, on the contrary—”
“No, no, dear friend; I state only what we all know.
The troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings.
The friends embraced cordially; D’Artagnan pressed Raoul’s hand.

The officers, table and that of the king were opposite to them.
Forward, Planchet, forward!
“Truly!”
“So would I,” said Porthos, unwilling to be behind D’Artagnan in generosity; “I would give as much as a hundred pistoles.”
Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage.”
You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have.”
He must be made to speak, in order that he might be spoken to—for Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial.
“Perhaps, when all is considered, you are right.
“I pray for it,” said D’Artagnan.
“If I did not fear to fatigue you,” said the general, evidently charmed with the count’s manners, “I would have taken you to the Chamber; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators.”
Cocles appeared, and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel’s apartment.
“Sir,” said the baroness humbly, “are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with him, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves that he was either mad or guilty?

“And hold, madame,” suggested Comminges, who was near a window, out of which he could see; “hold, the moment is a happy one, for there he is now, giving his blessing in the square of the Palais Royal.”
He extinguished the lamp, carefully concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.

“Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M. Danglars has left suspiciously.”
He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his Eminence curl with ire.

“Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois.
“Justice is done,” said Porthos, wiping his forehead.
All the world was ignorant of it.
He went on his way.
Aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.
“Are you quite alone?” inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass.
“I mean spinach,” replied Aramis; “but on your account I will add some eggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule—for eggs are meat, since they engender chickens.”

“No, I thank you.”
“And what did you do with that letter?”
“They—did you not see what they did?”
This is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have this year, you see, eleven, already plucked—twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.
And you?”
This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss.
“That’s exactly the reason I won’t go,” said D’Artagnan.
“How soon can he be here?”
On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_, who brushed gently against him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly.
The two friends, left alone, remained silent, face to face.
They were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments.

Andrea seized the certificate of his father’s marriage and his own baptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents.

“Ah!” said Porthos, “it is very pleasant to be able to say ‘the late Monsieur Mordaunt.’”
“How so?”
This visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then, forgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the date, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose his reckoning again.

“A week is too long.
“Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,” said Franz.
D’Artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face.

Do you bring me tidings of my guardian?”
This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither was it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.
But this did not arise from a want of affection; on the contrary, from a firm conviction.
“Good!” said D’Artagnan, rising and brushing his knees; “now I have thee—thou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville.”
Upon a word from her, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would betray my God.
At the same moment that he quitted the room, Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door.
But what can be the matter?

“It is a forgery.”
“Where is the treaty?”
“Ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.”
“Come and help me.”
“Go, then, animal,” said the duke; “but remember, I only allow you half an hour.”

Saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his attendant—for that night he himself slept in the camp.
If that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince.
D’Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance.

At the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there, motionless as a sentinel at his post.
Bonacieux.
“You have opened my eyes,” said the Italian gravely; “I will show the gentlemen the door.”
He had received a message from the prince, to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received it.
But D’Artagnan again shook his head.
“Yes; I have business in Italy.
Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours.”
“Well, I left them on my road—Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his hands; Aramis at Crèvecœur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at Amiens, detained by an accusation of coining.”

‘I come in the name of our master, Ali Tepelini.’—‘If you come from Ali himself,’ said Selim, ‘you know what you were charged to remit to me?’—‘Yes,’ said the messenger, ‘and I bring you his ring.’ At these words he raised his hand above his head, to show the token; but it was too far off, and there was not light enough to enable Selim, where he was standing, to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view.

This man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as he is now represented—broken down like an old man, suffering like a martyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his genius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts—but such as he really was at this period; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having supported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken Nîmes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Ré and lay siege to La Rochelle.

Patrick uttered a loud cry.
But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about it.

I am for those who save the state,” said Bonacieux, emphatically.

“When I informed him that your lordship was the _protégé_ of Monsieur de Tréville, and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be very much disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and immediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet was.”
Everyone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails.
It was this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf’s, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers.
Winter approached.
“Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient.
“My son,” she said, “persons in the count’s situation have many secret enemies.
Then, too, I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt again.

“On the contrary, stay, Monsieur d’Artagnan; your agreeable company will divert me.”
Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, “His father!
“But D’Artagnan!
“Tell me what!”
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo; “I think I arrived just in time to obtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me.”
“You are fond of gardening?”
“Who told you that I loved him?” asked Milady, sharply.
At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet, when he found a spigot; he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout; something, whatever it was the cask contained, fell silently into the tankard.
And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.
“Your excellencies permit it?” asked the host.
Valentine imperceptibly thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks.
Had he better deny everything or tell everything?
“What do you want?
At five o’clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had.
If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey you.
“Yes.”
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed bride whom he adored.
“I have not quitted you since yesterday,” returned Fernand sorrowfully.
You have water—woods—flowers there?”
But D’Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have remarked it.
“You are right, sir,” replied the governor; “and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject.
Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz d’Épinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter’s hand on whomever I please.”
Besides, I am a Picard.”
This word _procurator_ roused Porthos.
Monte Cristo advanced a few steps, which were heard on the gravel.
“And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?” said Monte Cristo; “did you credit it?”
In addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection.
“You think,” resumed Mazarin, “that Rochefort——”
“What can it mean?” said Debray to Franz.
Fortunately Lord de Winter is rich.”
Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship.
Chapter LIX.
“He must be a prophet, then,” said Valentine, smiling.
Besides, at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent.
Barrois made some steps towards his master.
“My dear Bazin, you ought to perceive,” said D’Artagnan, “from the place in which you find me, that I am greatly changed in everything.
What with D’Artagnan, Grimaud and Mousqueton, we can manage to dispatch eight of them.
“Shall I drive you back to Paris?” he asked.
The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest.
The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name.
We will invoke the remembrance of that poor De Winter, for whom he seemed to have a great regard; we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on; we will spend with him a guinea each per day; and I think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed.”
“Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe it!
No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”
“What is that?” inquired the abbé.

The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste.
“My turn,” said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent—“my turn.
“When shall you send your invitations?”
“Every day.”
“He has returned,” said he.
Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it?
The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtier’s lips, seemed to start from his eyes.
“Yes, his death; but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold.”
In the evening, Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that her father’s heart beat violently.
“We shall see,” said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, “On my word, the poor devil touches me.
D’Artagnan held the bridle of Athos’s horse and Porthos that of Aramis.
That’s _your_ opinion!” replied Porthos.
When seven o’clock came, Dantès’ agony really began.
“And they apologized to him for having carried you off?” said Beauchamp.
Bonacieux; “but why, then, did you cry out so?”
“Well,” asked he of the count, “what has, then, happened?”
“Then this young man escaped with you?”
Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper, and Morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident, went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with Emmanuel.
He took with him several of his subordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer.
“Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.”
The Night
“What queen?”
“Ah, see there, now!” said Caderousse; “and I did not recognize them!
“Ah, my dear count,” said Albert.
“Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians, I should not have thought this the place for such a demand.”
This was now all changed.
And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him.
Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?”
Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband.
“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.
“He has just left me,” replied De Winter, “after telling me all.
Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by D’Artagnan:
From this moment I declare the vendetta against you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet your last hour has come.’ And before he had recovered from his surprise, I opened the door and left the room.”
I dare not say more in a letter.
“Yet I think I hear her piano.”
The count went out first, then Albert.
“At length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of the ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.
“He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.”
“I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not content itself with vague reports.”
The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to speak.
“Very possibly I may not go,” answered Franz; “but in case I feel disposed, give me some particulars of today’s executions.”
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal’s death as a deliverance; and I, even I, opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand.
The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again, but controlling himself he answered:
At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars, wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.
“You were writing?” said Monte Cristo with a searching look.
At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
The dog again shook his head as if to say “no.”
“Bah!”
“And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville?”
“Yes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.”
“I don’t know.
Your eminence might knock against something, or fall into a hole.”
Raoul bowed, took the letter, went hastily down the mountain, leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop.
D’Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak.
“Captain Groslow!” cried Mordaunt.
The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man’s bed.
At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became terrified, not for myself—for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us smugglers—but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from the army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was everything to apprehend.
Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I get from one hobble into another.
“Oh!” said Porthos, “you can’t think that, D’Artagnan!”
Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle.
The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased to address themselves to him.
“Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?”
“You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?”
“But you say she is English?”
When the Te Deum was over, the coadjutor, without stopping to change his priestly dress, took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well.
“What!” exclaimed the queen, when the last of them had quitted the apartment, “you would yield to these limbs of the law—these advocates?”
Then he returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a clever architect, the plan Andrea had left him.
is it you, Aramis?” said Porthos.
On the contrary, I take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman.
If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other.
Albert was punctual.
“Really?” said Danglars.
“I must learn where we are going.
“And afterwards the road to Châtillon?”
The count turned up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting.
This letter” (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count)—“this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution, and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry.”
“You believe, and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial who is called Lord de Winter!
“I?—How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in regulating my income?
“I, too,” said the young man, “am a musician—at least, my masters used to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other, and a soprano less than any.”
I see nothing but faces a yard broad; in short, it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb, and that the trees, instead of leaves and flowers, are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days.”
“Alas, anything you please.
Ay, but it is for the first time, madame!”
His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects, and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half lost in the shadow of a stone column.
Grimaud, in fact, was not only the accountant, but the armorer of the party; and as he was a man full of forethought, these trousers, carefully rolled up in his valise, contained every sort of tool for immediate use.
“‘I expected thee,’ said the bandit to Rita’s father.
At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII.
“Good enough!”
M. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed.
The Journey
“Nonsense!
You will then have our swords, with which, I can assure you, my friend and I can play tolerably well.
But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language.
“We should be so on this occasion, if only to be faithful to our oath,” said Aramis.
1.F.4.
“Gentlemen, in the name of Heaven!” said the wounded man, collecting all his forces, as if to get up, “let us not lose time in useless words.
At the Royal Arms of England you will find a young gentleman named Mordaunt.”
All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.”
“Porthos, whilst I get up, watch the cardinal.
The president requested her to throw aside her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume, and was remarkably beautiful.”
“Oh,” said he, “that is life to me; more, more!”
“Gone,” said Morrel; “gone!—adieu, my friend—adieu, my father!”
Constance?” replied the young man, “where are you?
“What is that?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Ah!
“Dead?”
“Still, my lord, I can’t travel on my pay, for it is now three months behind; and I can’t travel on my savings, for in my twenty-two years of service I have accumulated nothing but debts.”
“There is a dupe somewhere.”
“They may tell us to open it.”
D’Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own, and hastened to her.
Well, this man was making signs to another at my left, and turning around I recognized the honest Grimaud.
“You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine; under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary.
friend, the cardinal, although such a genius, could never have done that.”
“I understand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not love you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk.
Well,” continued the count, in a tone that made Franz shudder, “this young gentleman is one of _my friends_—this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself—this young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither, and,” added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, “you have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.”
Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive, but Grimaud did not arrive.
“And Aramis wouldn’t swear?”
I do not know why, but I imagine that this woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her as I am, has an influence over my life.”
But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having killed her brother-in-law.
These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot.
“I think I can assist your researches,” said Maximilian.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.
“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “you may believe me if you like, but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.”
“Faith, sir,” said Raoul, smiling, although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair, “you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me.
“And you approve of what she said—that is to say, you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts?”
“No, on the honor of an officer; there is the half-pistole;” and he showed him the seductive coin, but did not give it him.
“I am no comrade of these people,” said the young man, proudly, “you have no right to insult me thus.”
Did the sun shine in my eyes?” And she leaned against the window.
“What is it?
“To the Palais.”
“And the Guardsman?”
Fernand’s eye darted lightning.
Morcerf paused at these words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he attributed to his silence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and darker.
And Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery.
Not at all; why should I?” The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes.
If victorious, I shall continue the struggle; if beaten, I am lost.
Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son; then she retired as silently as she had come, merely saying to Laporte:
“Oh, it is useless to inquire,” returned the count; “perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for.
The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper.
Why, you must have lost your senses.”
speak!”
The commissary of police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign to two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dantès’ right and the other on his left.
The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day, but he had reckoned without his guest.
“One moment, gentlemen,” cried Flamarens.
“Oh,” said the countess to Franz, “go with all speed—poor young man!
Ah, cursed basilisk, it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with you.”
Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes.
I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde, but on one condition—that he sometimes remembers the king’s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name.
He will set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he carries, and he will carry your Majesty’s letter, without even knowing it is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it.”
Finally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator’s wife should give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and Mousqueton to glory.
“Well,” said the other, “if this last resource fail you?”
here are the august signatures of your majesty’s hand; if you think you are right in giving them to me, you shall do so, but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them.”
You are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist.
M. Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him.
“Yes.”
“I have just received my courier from Greece,” said Danglars.
“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”
Chapter XLVII.
Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside.
Athos!” muttered D’Artagnan; “you think of every one; you are indeed a nobleman!
He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation.
D’Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend’s manner of acting, and who perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that the circumstances were serious, took Athos’s arm, and went out without saying anything.
This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the Allées de Meilhan, and a multitude of theories were afloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth.
The reputation of being out of his mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé unusual privileges.
“Tony, is your master sleeping?” said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment, which served as a kind of ante-room.
“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans.
Albert advanced towards Eugénie, smiling.
“The man of Meung!” replied D’Artagnan, and disappeared.
“Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort!” cried the prisoner, laughing violently, “and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee, the king’s commissioner.”
Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening.
“Without waiting for my coming out again?”
As to the monk, without withdrawing the poniard from the wound, he ran to the window, opened it, leaped out into the flowers of a small garden, glided onward to the stable, took out his mule, went out by a back gate, ran to a neighbouring thicket, threw off his monkish garb, took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier, clothed himself in it, went on foot to the first post, secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris.
under orders from General Cromwell.
“The Count of Monte Cristo.”
“But first, let Haydée be informed that I have returned.”
“Planchet!” cried D’Artagnan, beside himself with joy.
As soon as the earnest money was paid, D’Artagnan took possession of his lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost-new doublet of the elder M. d’Artagnan, and which she had given her son secretly.
“Do you think so?” said Mercédès.
“Oh, madame,” said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, “do not yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy, loved, and honored, and we will make you forget——”
“It is the one my brother sends for us.”
“(Signed) ‘Abbé Busoni.’”
She moved with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian.
There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty.
Rochefort passed at a gallop.
In an instant, from the door of the cabinet to the street gate, the whole hôtel was boiling.
It is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me.
“That is not a family name?”
“In that case, I’m your man.”
I should like, however, to know what this letter addressed to Tréville contains.” And the stranger, muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.
Ah!
Grimaud bowed.
The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey.
“Nothing good,” replied Porthos.
It is a mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East—that is, between the Tigris and the Euphrates.
“Oh, monsieur le comte,” replied the old man, “had any misfortune happened to you, I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again.”
“Sir,” began Raoul, with his usual politeness, “are you an ecclesiastic?”
“Yes.”
He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive, but just.
Felton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to him.
It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine!
“Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he, casting a bewildered look on his companion.
Baptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the letter.
“And by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,” said D’Artagnan, “you will deserve well of the cardinal.”
“Remember my words: ‘If you return home safely, I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you also.’”

“Alas, no, sir,” replied Andrea with a sigh, still more remarkable than the former ones.
But return to your question.”
“Yes.
More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse, and has lost money.”
“Yes, let us go to the library, please.” The marquis took his arm, and they left the salon.
All these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of Signor Pastrini’s; the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were also not wanting.
“I was at Rome during the last Carnival.”
But D’Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kitty’s door.
“No, count,—I hope—I assure you I shall do my best,” stammered Villefort.
He was, we repeat, handsome, young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return.
The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat, as if to bow, Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head.
His shoulder-knots were of burnished silver, his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it; a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat; his boots were of black leather, and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue Feron.
“One may well perceive, young man, that you are inexperienced.
“They will not be strangers, they will be friends.”
After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed; he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him, whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper, a mute and touching caress, which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter.
“Ah, ha,” cried Danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be very good eating!”
What I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your Grace.
It was the signal of a visit.
Are you going?” added she to Comminges.
“D’Artagnan and his friends.”
We had thus, at Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our goods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom-house officers.
To reach England”—Athos lowered his voice—“all France, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal, must be crossed.
“My dear friend,” said Caderousse, “eat of my bread, and take my advice; you will be none the worse off, physically or morally.”

My sporting dogs consist of two pointers, two harriers and two setters.
“Upon my word,” said Monte Cristo, “Paris is a strange city, and the Parisians a very singular people.
At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle.
“What fortune?”
The king, seeing that he did not reply, repeated his question.
“Go to the riverside, ask for the brig _Sund_, and give this letter to the captain; he will convey you to a little port, where certainly you are not expected, and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen.”
“Indeed!”
Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?”
In passing before D’Artagnan he recognized his former master.
“Sire,” said the cardinal, “leave severity to your ministers.
Six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt; he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell, when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen’s apartments.
Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner, “Put in your head!” But this was not the time for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile:
“I?
“Open the door.”
“I know not why you meddle,” said Fernand, seizing his arm; “but this I know, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantès, for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.”
It was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should write to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as speedily as possible.
Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: “‘Order to conduct—’ The name is blank,” interrupted Lord de Winter.
“My friend, my father,” said Morrel with excitement, “have a care, I again repeat, for the power you wield over me alarms me.
When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might experience—it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself.
As for Winter, at the sound of that voice he turned pale, and was, as it were, petrified.

“And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?” asked Monte Cristo.
The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of the king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of September.
Milady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had desired her, to lie down on the bed.

I shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that.
What is this?”
It was fourteen years, day for day, since Dantès’ arrest.
“And I, too,” he exclaimed in a low voice, “I unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.”
hello, lovely damsel!
“I am waiting, my lord, till you tell me of what exploits you speak.”
It is magnificent!” said Cavalcanti, who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.
Valentine seized the count’s hand.
“But, monsieur,” said Mousqueton, “I can’t swim; let me stay here.”
Chapter 114.
“You know, my dear count,” said he, “the ceremony is to take place this evening.

“I not the less maintain,” said the cardinal, “that the Duke of Buckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political.”
“And what is the origin of this name?”
“There is the Comte de la Fere, madame.
Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered:
Only, as our Gascon was not easily intimidated—or rather, thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear—he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the Guards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty.
“Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak.
“You have no sister—no son—no father?”
“Guard carefully the secret of your birth.
“I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank God—for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.
With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.

But why should I meddle in the matter?
They had told him to hope for it, but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate.
“A tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a gentleman.”
In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
“Come, come, enough of such compliments!” cried Porthos.
He kissed her hand tenderly.
“And whenever,” added Athos, “we meet in battle, at this word, ‘Place Royale!’ let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right, even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage.”
“Of course,” said he; “of what else should I speak?”
“Excuse me,” said the implacable young girl, “Monsieur Albert claims and well deserves his share.
“We were merely joking; drink to his health,” he added, filling Caderousse’s glass, “and do not interfere with us.”
“Bernouin,” said the cardinal, not turning round, for having whistled, he knew that it was his _valet-de-chambre_ who was behind him; “what musketeers are now within the palace?”
“You may, you may, sir,” said the queen with a bitter smile; “you were not so timid once.”
Danglars, then, without taking a crown from his pocket, could save Morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan, and Morrel was saved.
“You were right,” he said, “my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, and you cannot set out yet.
The Hôtel de la Trémouille!” At these cries, all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, “To the rescue, Musketeers!”
“Return instantly.
“Ho!
Accordingly, it was admitted to the presence of Anne, who, silent and lofty as ever, listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies; but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say, so calm remained her face, whether or no she had heard them.

D’Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he improvised.

Pray continue.”
The horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the terrified citizen, in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible.
“My brother?”
“I must have,” said the duke, “a proof of his connection with Buckingham.”
Still, though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess.
“I believe her to be a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.”
It was saddled and bridled.

The face of the steward, despite one slight shade of care, light as a summer cloud, seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity.
Come, then, my friend, we will go forward.”
Grimaud translated the question, and Groslow, who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead, answered:
As he spoke, two horsemen advanced at full speed.
I should like to have seen the count take something in my house, if only an ice.
Come, and I will explain to you.”

“My Dear Duke,—You may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note; he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at Vincennes with you, in order to prepare and assist your escape, which we are contriving.
Thank God, I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and believe he is dead.”
“Come,” said the count mildly, “do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men, Morrel!
On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him.
Alas, you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows, without being able to take any active part in them.
It is not true,” said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and with a countenance so unchanged, that if D’Artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.
“How do you make that out?” inquired Athos.
I will proclaim the violence you have used toward me.
It is you who surrendered the castle of Yanina!
Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him.
Then new concessions to the people, then a constitution, then liberty.
“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”
“Be quite at ease,” said Porthos, holding out his hand, which D’Artagnan took and shook in his.
D’Artagnan shrugged his shoulders.
He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor.
“Hang it!” said Porthos, a little perplexed between the two, “I suppose, as I came with you, I must go away with you.
“Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable to take, one of Huret & Fichet’s locks, revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist.”
“Then,” said she, “he has well played his part.”
Milady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance, that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard.
“I accept it,” said she; “he has a right to pay the dowry, which I shall take with me to some convent!”
A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of twenty-three.
“Listen.
“Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame de Morcerf and Albert——”
“Defend ourselves.
I know that—by name at least.”
“Under that pretense you run against me!
“Why, the grottos—caves of the island.”
“And the young man?”
On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect.
“Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantès return so suddenly—he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless!
The hostler, enchanted with the good day’s work he had done, returned to the yard.
The two young men he announced were indeed approaching.
where are you running to?” exclaimed a voice.
“To your Eminence!” murmured Bonacieux, rolling his eyes round in astonishment.
“I shall be gone only a few moments.”
“And have you succeeded?”
“It is well,” said Monte Cristo.
“Bless me!” cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of D’Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; “you must be mad to run against people in this manner.”
“The word is too mild.”
He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits, an open space surrounded by a hedge.
He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost directly an old lady entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her arm, and her bonnet in her hand.
“I should think we did know it,” exclaimed Albert, “since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like two poor students in the back streets of Paris.”
Milady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.
“A great man in every country, M. Debray,” said Château-Renaud.
They are not dead, for the death of D’Artagnan would make a sensation.
“I should be delighted to do so,” was the reply; “but if I am not mistaken, the words ‘In haste,’ are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought.”
The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant:
“What do you say?
“Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.”
I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I adored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully amassed by ceaseless toil.
I will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and Calais.
“I will do more than I promise,” said Dantès.
The Count of Monte Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease.
Every man has a devouring passion in his heart, as every fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was horticulture.
“Where are you?” asked the valet-de-chambre, whose eyes, dazzled by the light, could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom.
Then turning to the baroness: “May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?” said he.
That would not be endurable in any case, and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar.”
then we shall pay the more, that’s all, I see plainly enough.
He will see us if we go out.”
Cromwell is mighty, Mazarin is tricky, but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mordaunt.”
He and the Count de Guiche are like each other’s shadows.”
They would be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die with me.’
“Where is your wife, in the first place?”
“Yes, monseigneur,” said Porthos, “it is he.”
“Oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a bad sign to find the door open!
“By Count de Fuonsaldagna, General Beck and the archduke.”
It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.”
She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of the three—none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed:
They breakfasted in haste, and at six o’clock had already gone ten miles.
“Madame,” replied Athos, “do not injure the Vicomte de Bragelonne—do not ruin his prospects.
“Ali, a horse for M. de Morcerf—quick!
If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would be today, in all probability, condemned to death.
Then outrages were heaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever.
Morrel was dreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.
It is very easy,” he went on with a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.”
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.
“What do you want?” asked a voice.
The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his lips.
But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by everything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate.”
“Occupy yourselves with your own affairs, gentlemen, and let France settle matters as she will with me,” resumed Mazarin.
Presently a good, solid, wooden ladder was placed against the window.
They threatened me with torture.
“The chateau!” he said to himself, “what chateau?

Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
“Whose, then, is the air we breathe?
“Very probably,” answered the count.
“Good!” the other three exclaimed.
“Madame,” replied Aramis, “I must ask your pardon, but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry IV.
D’Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face.
The next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the newspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and at last fixed on _l’Impartial_, the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor.

“Why,” said Dantès, “if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me.
This time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him.
“And what may a myth be?” inquired Pastrini.
“I insult you!” said Lord de Winter, with contempt.
“What more do you want?” and she fell full length on the floor.
I will answer for it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.”

“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners would have his preference also.”
Chapter 113.
“And I,” said Planchet, with dignity, “I know them and I answer for them.”
Do not forget this evening—do not forget that promise.”
D’Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Tréville was not in the habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he more than kept his word.
“That’s true,” said Athos, after a moment’s silence, “that’s true!
“Half an hour’s rest is enough,” replied the Gascon.
“Certainly.
“Edward,” said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, “go and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.”
“Two feet below you; take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor.
“Oho!” said they, “not in bed at a quarter past eleven.
We will not expose your eminence to the chances of war.”
Now to the work I have in hand.” And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed.
“I do not know,” said the servant, “but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentine’s room: perhaps she has emptied them.”
“No,” replied the two Musketeers, after a moment’s silence, “no, sir, we do not.”
“Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear, whatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.”
Carefully closing the box door, Ali placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian.
“And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?”
Chapter LXXIV.
“Thanks, my lord.
Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so.
and who was he?”
Pale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace.
“Porthos?”
“Your excellency,” he said, “the master of the Hôtel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcerf.”
The moon, which had shone for a short time, disappeared behind the clouds; every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert, the ocean, and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows.
“To die whilst doing a good deed!
Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by God’s.
“Adieu, gentlemen,” said the count; “I am going to sleep twenty-four hours; I am just falling down with fatigue.”
“Ah!
For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice.
At the expiration of ten minutes Felton came.
The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.”
“No, I am pleased—so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as I am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might not compromise you.”
The king’s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign, for in firm, sonorous accents, which vibrated in the depths of Athos’s heart, the king began his speech, explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom.
But make haste—I cannot stay here all day.” Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès’ ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.
“What then?” said the king.
D’Artagnan was conqueror—without much effort, it must be confessed, for only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for form’s sake.
“And you,” asked Porthos, “haven’t you still in your service your old lackey, that good, that brave, that intelligent—-what, then, is his name?”
“Cardinalists or Frondeurs, what matters it?
This is what had taken place: We have seen that it was not of his own free will, but, on the contrary, very reluctantly, that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner.
“Oh, death is in my house!” cried Villefort.
“Nothing that would lead you to suppose?”
Mordaunt, after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep, had gone down into the cellar, convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber.
“Yes,” indicated the old man.
“You promise, sir—that’s agreed—that I shall find you to-morrow at Charenton?”
“You are wrong, then.
He was one of those English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling.
That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere.
“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as quickly as you can!”
“Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?”
“Towards the Louvres.”
“Sure to gain!” repeated Beauchamp, looking with amazement at the count.
Then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress.
But although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary who first made his appearance.
The footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.
Chapter LXXXV.
D’Artagnan,” said Porthos, “I must out with it at once, for I can’t keep to myself anything I have against you; I haven’t been able to recognize you in this matter.”
“But I am speaking to you!” replied the young man, additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of politeness and scorn.
She had profited by my absence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum, had set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it.
“Listen—you know if I may be relied on.”
“I have seen,” he said, “many dreadful things, but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just witnessed.
“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer.
In the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions.
Major Cavalcanti
“A little.”
The host was in a lower and back room, to which Athos was requested to go.
As he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair, while he seated himself in another opposite the window.
She then turned to the right, followed the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, “Remain here, my Lord Duke; someone will come.” She then went out by the same door, which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.
“No, merely his testamentary executor.
“But,” said the Englishman, “this looks very much like a suspension of payment.”
“Count,” returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert’s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions, “I do not say this to you, but to your companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to be laughed at.”
“It is important that none of your crew should see me.”
They proceeded thus to Peronne.
M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself——
I wish my life to be free and open.
“Well, I am wrong.
“A Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me.
It is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry-go-round wheels and rewards us.
Franz was the “excellency,” the vehicle was the “carriage,” and the Hôtel de Londres was the “palace.” The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase.
M. Coquenard was served first, then Porthos.
“What!” cried Aramis and Athos, “what!
“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned.
I shut my eyes, and I can see you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a hundred times more beautiful!”
Show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal, unless, indeed——”
“Come, come,” said D’Artagnan, “more reason why we should start on our journey.
“Well, well!” said he, “you are brave young men, proud in daylight, faithful in darkness.
“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said.
Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune.
“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”
“Shall you be attacked on the road?”
Then he looked anxiously at Valentine.
During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and secured his trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to take off; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake.
Besides, to tell truth, whilst D’Artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos, he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos, true-hearted, open Athos.
“Well, let us go, then, where the fighting is, for that is the most likely place to meet with D’Artagnan, Porthos, and possibly even Raoul.
Felton, abandon me!
“She is at the ball, as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress.” Noirtier again closed his left eye.
“Yes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject.”
“Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in,” replied Athos, drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king’s blood.
Take what precautions you please, if it is any satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I seek.”

Everything fell out as Mme.
To Caderousse’s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the count’s breast, flew back blunted.

“I thought I saw,” said one of the servants, “horsemen dressed in yellow, creeping along the bed of the stream.
Come on, here, you others,” he continued, rising in his stirrups, raising his sword, and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught.
“Oh,” continued Milady, “do your wounds still make you suffer?”
“Well, how is it with this madman?” exclaimed he, turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to inquire if he was unhurt.

“A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend?
Louis XVIII.
He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head.
An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the _Lives of the Saints_ to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without being announced.
“The police.”
“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men—_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked for.
“Don’t be afraid.
“Ah, yes,” said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand, which he sipped slowly.
Madame Danglars rose suddenly.
“The streets are full of armed men,” continued D’Artagnan.
There was a moment’s silence,—it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body.
Well, ever since then, the infernal project has been ripening in her brain.”
“Dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of them.”
You don’t love me.
It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in France; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like Andrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.

The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish—for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat.
“Shall I send word to him as coming from you?”
“As you execute you will understand.”

The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud, who turned away his head.
“Yes, I have seen him,” he replied, “and he has handed this letter to me.
Why did we not destroy the child with the mother?”
“You are too bad, Athos; one can hide nothing from you,” answered D’Artagnan.
He sat down without saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.
I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp, who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he will bring his witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and I am expected to kill him for all that.”

“Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian’s room this instant,” replied Monte Cristo, “I have something of the greatest importance to tell him.”
“It is true, then,” he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion,—“it is true, then, that all our actions leave their traces—some sad, others bright—on our paths; it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands;—it leaves its track!

“‘To the right,’ said Caderousse.
He had seen in his province—that land in which heads become so easily heated—a few of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascony.

“Let us charge them,” answered the Gascon.
What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort.’ The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from utter indifference, while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.”

Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked at his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment.

“That’s all very well,” replied D’Artagnan; “but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Milady.”
“But what are you up to?”
“Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country.”
Explain to me why going out of this chamber isn’t everything.”
“That is to say,” stammered Milady, “I am not really very intimate with any of them.
“Ten pistoles.”
Mordaunt’s very lips grew white with rage.
I descended rapidly; although I had not seen Villefort’s face, I recognized him by the beating of my heart.

“I am at your service, madame,” replied Lucien coldly.
“Now, gentlemen, a _sortie!_” cried Athos.
The room was whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture.
Hardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered.
It had been D’Artagnan’s practice, ever since the riots, to sleep in the same room as Porthos, and on this eventful morning he was still there, sleeping, and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat, which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles.
One thing, however, reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders.

It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community.
“What is it?” said she, starting at Madame Danglars’ touch as she would have done from an electric shock.

Monsieur d’Artagnan made a compact with you; and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife, and has placed her beyond reach.”
“Come, vicomte,” he said, “it is time for you to go to bed; you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince.

“Generous girl!” cried Anne of Austria.
“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas.
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor.
And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.
“Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer.”
As soon as this organization was established, they set about driving the English from the Isle.
“Ho!
He therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois, and after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while Madame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:
Assuming a dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her husband.
It is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were.
“I will do my best,” said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting up his knife.
“With all my heart.
“Oh, thank you, sir, thank you, Monsieur Broussel,” said Friquet; “I am so fond of apricots!”
“The Count of Morcerf’s adventure exasperates the young man.”
The count had just opened a door.
“_Pardieu!_” said he, “here is a strange thing!
The names have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know who this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper names are not in the dictionary.”
What do you say to it, Aramis?”
“But does he know this secret, then?”
His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money, and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table.
Dantès said, “I wish to die,” and had chosen the manner of his death, and fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die.
With forty-five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six months—you with your music, and I with my voice—we shall double our capital.
The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal, and one of them, passing under D’Artagnan’s arm, entered and broke a mirror, in which Porthos was complacently admiring himself.
“You saw your wi—”
“Then sell out—sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.”
Allow me to ask you a question: Where are the plenipotentiaries?”
Behind this group walked the surgeon; and behind the surgeon the door closed.
But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, “I must speak to you.”
“M.
In fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at the same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him.
“Alas, yes,” said Milady.
With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.
“You ungrateful to Marie Michon, monsieur?” said Madame de Chevreuse, trying to read in Athos’s eyes.
It is a chain of recollections—an idea which carries you back to other times, to other places—which, very likely, have no connection with the present time and place.
“Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?”
“Nonsense!
It is a long time since we have had a battle, eh, Porthos?”
M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his business makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it——”
“So it is agreed, and if Porthos makes no objection——”
“Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.”
The watchword is, ‘King and Ré.’”
Chapter III.
You are a brave soldier, one of the few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV.
Must you know all?”
The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to flight.
“Pooh!” replied Porthos, “I am what I am.”
“Grimaud, is it thou?”
And without adding another word, Grimaud, profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors, rushed from the room.
“And to sign the contract in three days?”
“If I should be killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be killed, it will be another’s turn, and so on—provided a single one arrives, that is all that is required.”
The minister, so feared, so hated by his master, has descended into the tomb, drawing after him the king, whom he would not leave alone on earth, lest his work should be destroyed.
“Go on.”
“You say so with an accent—stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk to the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury for the same sum.”
The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation.
On his left was Porthos, whilst D’Artagnan was on his right; each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side.
“’Tis not too warm to walk,” resumed D’Artagnan.
“What was I saying?
“Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000 francs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.”
During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study, glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror, starred in every direction.
“Barrois,” said the doctor, “can you speak?” Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words.
“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.
“I hate the English—they are coarse, like every nation that swills beer.”
“Die!” cried Mademoiselle Paulet, bitterly, “he!
It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an exclamation.
Melancholy in a capitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to the world.”
Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them.
“He knows you better by your actions than your name; he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort, and he has instigated an active search for them, I can answer for it.”
If it be to avenge her, I am ready to follow you.”
D’Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was a lieutenant’s commission in the Musketeers.
“Because before then we shall have carried him off.”
I had no longer any wish to live for myself, I have lived for him.
“‘Luigi Vampa.’”
“Sir,” said d’Épinay to Noirtier, “since you are well acquainted with all these details, which are attested by honorable signatures,—since you appear to take some interest in me, although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final satisfaction—tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may at least know who killed my father.”
“He calls that a language!
“Valentine, you are an angel!”
You can understand our disappointment when, arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood, which at a distance had quite a gay appearance, with its red roof and green shutters, we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed—Ah!
“You thoroughly understand me, sir?
madame,” cried Mazarin, “you have ruined us all—the king, yourself and me.”
“Ah, that would be a great pity,” said Villefort.
The Vendetta
“On the contrary,” said Athos, “it must be preserved carefully.
Chapter LXXVIII.
“Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world.”
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst.
A youthful indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large?”
The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman, were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality.
All this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium.
“Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.”
I make about twelve thousand francs a year, without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me.”
Does Madame de Morcerf dance?”
“Half a million, is it?” said the major.
“Can you be a coward?” continued Villefort, with increasing excitement, “you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?
The Rain of Blood Chapter 46.
Truly, she might have thought of you at home.”
“Oh, come, then, come!” cried she, hastening away with the young man.
As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk.
Embrace also our good and brave Porthos.
His whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took, instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned frock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front; tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s, which appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics.
He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made, and, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet.
D’ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the Swiss.
“Do you hesitate?” asked Mazarin.
“Patience, madame, I am coming to it.”
The abbé shook his head.
Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and joyful, to my country.
“Not exactly,” replied the mendicant.
“What do you say to a thousand crowns?”
You understand, then, Comte de la Fere, you understand, Chevalier d’Herblay, that I am altogether and always at your service.”
“Who the beggar was that I killed.”
“Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his chisel fall to the floor.
“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.”
Come—do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is capable?
The story of Ganymede, Maximilian, is not a fable, but an allegory.”
Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to the Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it.
And with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground, D’Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.
They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.”
“Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must be interesting.”
“Sir,” said Raoul, returning the count’s pressure of the hand, “I like you already, from my heart; pray regard me as a devoted friend, I beseech you.”
“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not have been here.”
“I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.”
I am sure he answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.”
“Where is my son?” asked Villefort; “let him be removed from the house, that he may not see——”
They obtained information at Ablain, and a statement of their route was left for Grimaud.
Chapter LXXXVI.
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the noise of M. de Tréville’s entrance he turned round.
“Aramis,” he continued, “was intimate with a young needlewoman from Tours, a cousin of his, named Marie Michon.”
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing, “we have had that honor.
Meantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by D’Artagnan, threatened by Athos, and that she had quit France without being revenged on them.
“Ah!
One day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even to borrow it of Athos.
And if I have any counsel to give, it is, always lose!”
“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”
“You know, sir, I do not speak French?”
And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier, and arrived steaming at Louvres.
When he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife, pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained, perhaps, twice as much more.
Then D’Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune, very well knows—D’Artagnan was not a millionaire; he hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant.
“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and d’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave me to avenge my child.”
“Ah, indeed,” said D’Artagnan.
“Certainly; and on the other hand, my lord, you have lost it, and now, in accordance with the law of war, sir, you must buy it back again.”
Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and mute, awaited one kind word of consolation.
In truth, in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers.
I am on the earth to punish, madame,” he added, with a flaming glance; “any other woman, were it the queen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be merciful.
Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”
The old man, who had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so.
“Yes, Raoul,” replied the count.
“However that may be, D’Artagnan,” replied Athos, without falling into the snare which his Gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love, “however that may be, you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true; but I am wrong to dispute with my master.
The Road to Picardy.
“Alas, sir!
He offered his hand to the baroness, who, descending, took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo.
They shook their heads.
He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
There was no fear of her falling asleep.
“And then,” resumed D’Artagnan, “to this decrepitude is probably added poverty, for he must have neglected the little that he had, and the dirty scoundrel, Grimaud, more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master—stay, Planchet, it breaks my heart to merely think of it.”
“Enough, enough!” cried Morrel, almost overpowered; “leave me, I pray you; we shall meet again in a happier time.
“Now,” he continued, “withdraw a little and let me say my prayer, I beseech you.
He stopped, however, at the door for an instant.
He, however, darted not the less quickly toward Milady, yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron.
“Who is in command here?” asked the cardinal.
A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises.”
D’Artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing.
“Thank you, madame,” said Mazarin.
“She is afraid so.”
“The deuce you say!” replied the marquis, “let us lose no time, then!”
“Well, let that care be mine, and be at ease.”
D’Artagnan followed him, and Mousqueton, having closed the door, mounted behind the carriage with many groans.
Danglars did not answer.
You are Fernand Mondego, the French officer who led the troops of my noble father!
“But you should take me there one day with you.”
Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news.
Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine’s hand.
“Is this all?”
D’Artagnan was the youngest of all these men.
“Yes.
Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions.
Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around; indeed, Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid, or uttering a word.
“I do not.”
Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said, ‘Come, despatch the dying.’”
He had stanched the wound and the man was better.
He related to Athos all that had passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.
“The Count of Monte Cristo?”
“That will do for us.
Upon this promise D’Artagnan withdrew, and the next day he began service.
“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”
This night I have had a fearful sleep.
“But what do you think of the music?”
Precept something, but example more.
“Or Camille de Bois-Tracy.”
As to your rank, an annual income of 50,000 livres will enable you to support it admirably.
Idiot that I am, though I have been trying to find it out for five years, I never found it out.”
“No, you shall live honored and pure; you shall live to triumph over your enemies.”
“But,” asked the sailor, “where are your companions?
“Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency, and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the meantime, follow Debray’s example, and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit.”
The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness; but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement.
“Monsieur Porthos!
Interrogate me, I entreat you!”
0239m
“Why, I have related the events to you.
But—and I say it with some pride, Mercédès—God needed me, and I lived.
“No.”
It was very natural, he being the only person in the whole assemblage, except the king, the queen, and the Duke of Orleans, who slept gratuitously.
Don’t make a bad use of it, I entreat you.
The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them.
“Oh, for pity’s sake,” said she, “you will live, will you not?”
Immediately afterwards the light expired, and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity, while the clock at that minute struck half-past four.
Oh, the scoundrels!
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot.
“Oh, you don’t see straight,” said Danglars; “he’s gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries.”
“Edward?
After a wild youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least for some time, the follies of adolescence.
“However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible thing.”
The young men bowed, and quitted the box.
The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Athos.
“I, however, do not understand,” said Porthos.
Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, Milady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber, and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented himself.
Habitually he spoke little and slowly, bowed frequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were fine and of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great care.
Oh, it was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father’s faith.
Instead of improving these gifts, rarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course—you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend.”
“Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.”
Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aramis.”
Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to Condé were suggested.
Take pity on me, then, and go!
“I have the honor to be, with respect, etc.,
“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”
“Oh!
His recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.
No time was to be lost.
“I do not understand you, sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “and if I did, your tone is too high.
The count had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted.
40092m
“Here is my pass countersigned,” said the latter.
Oh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!”
Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read:
he is quite a child!”
The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if he wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own chair.
“Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o’clock this evening,” said Franz, “and whom I have not seen since.”
He now determined not to begin the game with D’Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary’s cards.
It was then striking half-past ten by St. Paul’s.
Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive.
“What are you going to do at Portsmouth?” asked Milady.
The lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the sadness of their masters.
“Which,” interrupted the duchess, “is now brought up against her as a great crime.”
“Nevertheless, you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like!”
“He has done so, sir, and this last battle, which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy, proves that he will not yield without a struggle; but in case he is beaten?”
The second was the man’s conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it contained a few poor articles of household furniture—a bed, a table, two chairs, a stone pitcher—and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling, which the count recognized as sweet peas, and of which the good man was preserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.
“And yet I speak ill of him,” replied Milady, finishing the thought of the superior.
Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow.
“I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his breast.”
Isn’t it reasonable?”
It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle; he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back, and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door.
These steps came on, came fast.
“Come, come,” continued the count, “complaints are unavailing, be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will watch over you.”
That is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable.
Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.
Come now, recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de Gassion.”
“General,” said the president, “do not alarm yourself; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity, but as you have said, you are among conspirators, you are in possession of our secret, and you must restore it to us.” A significant silence followed these words, and as the general did not reply,—“Close the doors,” said the president to the door-keeper.
I spurred on and found myself in the enemy’s ranks.”
Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d’Angoulême on the east, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from Perigny to Angoutin.
“Don’t waste time in swearing,” said D’Artagnan; “let us gallop, if our horses will consent.”
“That is well understood.”
“Me!
I understand, and foreseeing that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of affairs, certain precautions.
“What makes you believe this?”
She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and twisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless.
“Will you eat any of these beans, Cousin Porthos?” said Mme.
“Stay,” said Monte Cristo, “here, in this very spot” (and he stamped upon the ground), “I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather, the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant.”
While this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey descended.
The three friends hastened toward D’Artagnan, who, instead of being ill, ran toward his horse.
what reason do you assign?”
Meanwhile, Athos, in his concealment, waited in vain the signal to recommence his work.
“You to say what you would do in her place,” Mazarin hastened to reply.
You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases, of which paralysis is one.
Now, madame, I took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts.
Let him be interred in holy ground.
There, to his great astonishment, D’Artagnan heard the policy which made all Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life of the cardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into.
I believe, while the Countess G—— takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain.
“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.
“For unpaid wages; yes, I know it.
“On the honor of gentlemen,” said Aramis and Porthos.
And when I told you I had foreseen the result, it is the honor of your visit I alluded to.”
You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.
“Three times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she murdered the woman I loved.
“Count, may I suggest one idea to you?”
“Ah!
Now, I am going to show you how sincere I am.”
Tell him that our conversation at the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned Lord de Winter of my journey to England; that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared—D’Artagnan and Athos; tell him that the third, Aramis, is the lover of Madame de Chevreuse—he may be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the fourth, Porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not worth troubling himself about.”
While the count smiled at hearing this song, which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto, Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband’s strength of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at Milan.
“But I think I have it,” said Athos.
“Who is he?”
run for help!” cried Grimaud, “and I will remain beside him here.”
I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world, but you do not belong to me alone; you belong to all our party.
“But where is the doctor?” exclaimed Villefort; “where is he?”
When you come to Paris, I will return all this.”
They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest into the salon.
“How!
BONACIEUX AT HOME Chapter XVIII.
“One word more, my lord; if there’s any fighting where I’m going, must I fight?”
D’Artagnan, I ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you; Aramis does the same to Porthos; now hate me if you can; but for my own part, I shall ever, even if you do hate me, retain esteem and friendship for you.
It was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat.
When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near, he wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him.
Bonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had become of her.
“And do you think she is not there?”
Let us see; with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons, are you rich?
D’Artagnan, with a sudden accession of wrath, seized the lad by the ear and led him apart, with the injunction:
When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planchet.
D’Artagnan bowed and followed the queen.
Providence is now opposed to them, when I most thought it would be propitious.
“A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.”
“But,” said the officer, “I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell.”
But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you oppose them?”
He was a man between thirty-nine and forty years of age, of medium height but a very well proportioned figure; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy; his beard black, and his hair turning gray, as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad, more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion.
“He said?” resumed Porthos.
But all my fortune is in England.
Bonacieux dead, and D’Artagnan in a swoon.
“Raising my scaffold!” cried the king, astounded.
I think it does indeed!” cried the Gascon, who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court.
“Among my friends of other times?” said the queen.
Then he entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food; he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread.
He remained in his cell, and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.
At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park.
The three gentlemen then shook hands, Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore, and Athos and Aramis remaining together.
The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns, according to the Italian custom, and, as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table—the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form—are well understood, the supper-table was loaded with wax-lights and flowers.
“Oh, let them come in!
“A man or a woman?”
It is for a consultation, which will last three hours at least.
A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the boat replied.
“My father and the Baron d’Épinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending,” said Villefort.
“Ah, true!
Mousqueton, at the head of them, wiped his eyes.
“Yes, monsieur.”
Besides, his probity was irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era, and the poor with God’s Seventh Commandment.
“But,” resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment, “if, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give way and continues to menace France?”
“I know myself, Father; my resolution is irrevocable.”
“As you will,” replied the duke.
Monte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an expression almost humble:
“Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.”
“And what have master pastrycooks to do with us?”
From this moment Vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a mark—the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the Sabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon became so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.
The morning was beautiful, and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades, like curtains of golden gauze.
It was warm work.”
“25th April, 149’”
Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account, and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution, hidden behind some screen or curtain.
“That is doubtless our boat,” said Athos.
there’s a carriage coming over yonder.”
My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me.
“To sea?”
What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from one far less pure.
There are hours which last a year.
Well, as you please, I even gain something by it, for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours.
“Sire,” replied Juxon, “you shall be obeyed.”
“The scheme is well known,” said the inspector; “and the abbé’s plan has not even the merit of originality.”
You do not avoid going to war by that means; you see, the cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and partisan in hand.
The count soon heard Andrea’s voice, singing a Corsican song, accompanied by the piano.
It was a very near thing, but he is not dead.”
“Well, then, I count on you.”
“What voices?” asked Valentine.
“You are thoughtful,” said Mazarin, uneasily.
My only fear is the chance of Dantès being released.
Nothing,” said Milady, smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile.
“Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart,” said Valentine; “and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haydée!
“Ah, my faith!” said Athos, “you require too much, D’Artagnan.
However, Raoul must be diverted from this fancy.
“He gave no other name,” answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count, “than that at the end of his letter—‘Sinbad the Sailor.’”
With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle—spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.
If it was Valentine alone, he would speak as she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery.
“Edmond Dantès.”
At the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to Valentine’s room, accompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of M. de Villefort.
But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.
“We will wait, then,” said Morrel.
The young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her handkerchief to her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre, who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room.
Patrick soon caught the sound of his master’s voice calling his falcon.
Oh, my dear friend, if this be the case,—if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be dead, if you put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are consoled—do not complain.”
“To-morrow, rather,” said De Chatillon, “if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charenton.”
Listen, D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.
Still, as five o’clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner.
Speak, gentlemen, speak—I am listening; conceal nothing, gloss over nothing.
Tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a Spartan, he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken.
now shall I tell you something?” added Athos, coolly.
His requests were not granted, but he went on asking all the same.
“Bless me,” murmured Baron Danglars, “this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him ‘excellency,’ and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre.
“Good!
“‘Sblood!
That happened which M. de Tréville had foreseen.
“Pardon me, madame, for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger; and I, in exchange, pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me.
Léon d’Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair black, eyes black; travelling with his sister.”
“The part she plays, _pardieu!_ It is not difficult to divine that, after all you have told me.
By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to write.
“At any rate,” said Porthos, “I am glad to hear D’Artagnan admit that he is afraid.”
No, he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket, and took from it a paper folded in four, and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential, he said:
And he touched his mule.
“Well,” said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, “it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord Ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.”
“He has.”
“That is to say,” eagerly replied the wounded man, who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim—“that is to say, I was, but am no longer; it is fifteen years since I gave up the office.
“Why, what has happened to you?—are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage?” asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV.
“Yes, yes, I know what you mean,—the railway, of which he has obtained the grant, is it not?”
But why do you ask?”
“How once?” stammered Debray; “what do you mean?”
If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg™ work.
“But if he does not come?” said D’Artagnan.
“Eh, monsieur!” said he, addressing D’Artagnan, “don’t you remember that face which is blinking yonder?”
And without losing a minute, thinking he saw an opening, he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring.
“When I saw you at your chateau at Bragelonne, I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood; instead of answering me as a friend, you played with me as a child; the friendship, therefore, that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords, but by your dissimulation at your castle.”
“You must blindly take what I give you.”
“Wait,” said Caderousse, “we shall see.” He then took the greatcoat with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury, and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti’s hat, which he placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself.
“There are the fifty louis, i’faith,” said Aramis, emptying the purse on the table, all bearing the effigy of Louis XIII.
The count hastily descended, presented himself at the already opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold.
“Ah, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps!”
Gondy remained firm, and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done; but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop.
“You have asked for me?” said the Musketeer.
At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely, Albert’s mask fell off.
“In a very simple manner, colonel,” said D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to refuse to pledge him.

But without taking any heed of the sword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.
She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her father’s, related the scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and showed him the letter.
The nurse, having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the door, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king’s attorney.
Valentine durst not oppose her grandmother’s wish, the cause of which she did not know, and an instant afterwards Villefort entered.
“And what does he wish?
This was their mutual declaration of love.
“How would you realize?”
“It is desirable I should know the real cause.”
“In my name,” said Mme.
“Ah, I knew well,” said the Gascon, “that you were a man of talent.
Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected here—old cabinets, Japanese porcelain, Oriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the world—everything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he recognized their date, their country, and their origin.
a bruise.”
What do you mean by that?
In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being celebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by Dantès.
The Beggar
And yet you say he has sent you some as from us?”
“Now,” said Felton, “we are safe.”
A being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him.”
“_Parbleu_, I believe it is not,” said Planchet.
“Do you not think that they have sent for you, both for the same thing?”
One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details, on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor.
He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him.
D’Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight.
“Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,” he said to the nurse.
“No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to him.”
As they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from D’Artagnan, not all that had happened, but what D’Artagnan himself knew.
“Bah, let us enjoy that pleasure,” said Aramis, with his mild and careless manner.
“He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met—at—ah—yes, indeed.
“M.
“’Tis true, however,” answered the sailor; “there’s nothing in the wake of the ship; besides, here’s the end of the cable.”
Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose existence he would not believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert had been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers.
The cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those _damned Musketeers_, those _daredevils_—he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me—those _braggarts_, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat’s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Férou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters!
Athos sighed deeply.
Anne of Austria started.
_Diable!_ when a churchman is killed, it should be with a different weapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a father.
Uneasiness took possession of the tender, constant heart of Athos, and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis.
“I know nothing about it, my lord.”
“She is quite well,” replied Danglars quickly; “she is at the piano with M. Cavalcanti.”
The fair Indian, astonished at the sensation her observation produced, looked down and resumed her air of naivete.
D’Artagnan started alone on his journey, without other escort than his sword, and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queen’s presence.
Two hours passed thus.
“It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought for,” replied Edmond, still incredulous.
“What a question!
And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother.”
“Well, madame,” said Mazarin, bowing, “I desire that you give me a share in your friends, as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given me.
“I am glad to hear it, baron,—for I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants.
“Men fear him and spare him.”
I do not.”
“Move on, then.” And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.
And if I do not possess that talent, which your smiles prove to me you doubt, should I not still have that ardent love of independence, which will be a substitute for wealth, and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self-preservation?
“Have you nothing more to do there?” asked Morrel.
“In what way?”
In turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre, in order to reach the Rue Tiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette, where he had appointed Porthos to meet him, he saw at one of the windows of the hotel, that friend himself dressed in a sky-blue waistcoat, embroidered with silver, and gaping, till he showed every one of his white teeth; whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman, so handsome and so rich, who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness.
“But you are wounded, it seems,” said Planchet.
“Oh, that’s very well, young man,” continued M. de Tréville, “that’s all very well.
Athos raised his sword; D’Artagnan lowered his.
Dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid, and pressing with all his force on the handle, burst open the fastenings.
“Why have you hated him?”
The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room.
“A gallant knight cannot decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments.”
“Madame,” said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and who recoiled before this conjugal anger, “madame, what do you say?”
“Go, sir count,” replied D’Artagnan, carelessly; “you see nothing to keep you a little longer in England?
“And you?”
“So you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing—a resolution registered!”
D’Artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital.
“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost.
“Ah, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon?
M. de Villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was visibly affected, and when Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it tremble.
I neglected it, and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me—Constance disappeared.
“That’s true!”
D’Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for.
They passed into the eating room—a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen.
What I cannot tell,—something wonderful, an absurdity, a miracle,—of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope.
The duke had thrown himself, as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation, on his bed.
0283m
“What is that?”
A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet.
Thus talking, they traversed the streets, full of people on account of the fete, and arrived opposite the old cathedral, where first mass was going on.
The Hundred Days Chapter 14.
At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing:
“But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?”
No one knows what there is.”
The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken.
“Ah,” said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness, “do not talk of such things, and suffer love pains?
“Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that Andrea was moved to the very soul.
Another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.
They placed themselves on guard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_, he had already three inches of steel in his breast.
“And how long had you to take care of him?”
If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter.
D’Artagnan frowned at him.
“Do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and knows that I have been to London?”
“Not for a stranger,” said Debray, “but for a friend I might, perhaps.”
“Yes,” said the procureur, “and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.”
The old marshal turned toward the viscount, grateful for that praise of his son, whilst the prince exclaimed:
“No; I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators.”
“Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is trying to attract your attention.”
He gained just twelve hours by this engagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight o’clock in the evening.
M. Noirtier—for it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might be overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents.
I have nothing to say that cannot be said before all.”
Villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Méran’s in the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon.
“I only arrived yesterday.”
But the moment is come to keep your word; I have reached my destination.”
At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierrefonds.
The Office of the King’s Attorney Chapter 68.
When Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son; when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when Villefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,—
She belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier.
My God, I am lost!”
“Since 1811.”
“Sir, unless you force me——”
A man, wrapped in a cloak, appeared at the door, but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions, and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him.
“I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth,—my father and Mercédès.”
You shall soon see him.
“Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend?
In each there was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.
“What a Puritan you are!” said he; “that happens every day.”
“You are sure he will keep his word with me?”
D’Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke’s hôtel.
Come hither, monsieur.”
“As a matter of fact,” said Monte Cristo, approaching, “I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.”
“Count,” she said, “you are, I fear, gained over to the court.
She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage.
“Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character,” said the count; “on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life, and the real visage is disclosed.
“Now, then,” said the duke, and as he spoke, lowered the cane almost level with the ground; “Pistache, my friend, jump for the ‘Illustrious Coxcomb, Mazarin de Piscina.’”
Presently they heard Milady retire to her room.
sir, ’tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver.”
Once thus ensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is over, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction.
The king’s!
“And you, sir?” continued Gondy, turning to the curate of St. Sulpice.
Then he added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, “It is true, then; you do not deny it!” She moved forward.
“What is that?” said he; “whence comes that cry?”
“Well, can I see Porthos?”
They disobeyed orders.”
In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king’s window, and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it.”
“That is, whether you really love me?”
The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let fall the pistol he held.
That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them.
“Sir, I surrender,” said Louvieres, presenting his unloaded musket to the officer.
It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimauds.
The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition.
“Good!” exclaimed the duke, rubbing his hands.
The Lions’ Den
“But how did she become so?”
Then he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of human philosophy, “Perhaps!”
“Monsieur Porthos,” said she, “I can assure you that you have severely punished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation, you have but to apply to me.”
“But—if the plot had succeeded?”
“MY DEAR COUSIN, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.
“Well, well, Dandré,” said Louis XVIII., “Blacas is not yet convinced; let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper’s conversion.” The minister of police bowed.
“Do you fear any approaching evil?
On what plea?”
So the two swords were crossed close to the hilts, and as D’Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made the retreating step; but D’Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this movement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line.
“You ate it?”
He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and the pen fell from his hand.
“Ah!” said Athos, leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be.
Conversational.
“Instantly!”
Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey, she resolutely drew near to Aramis’s shutter, and tapped, at three equal intervals, with her bent finger.
I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness.
“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.
Aramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a large, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.
“To Marseilles!” exclaimed the young couple.
“With what ideas does that letter inspire you?”
The duchess was the first to speak.
They believe me her accomplice, and will punish me with her.
“At your service, sir.”
“In the first instance to Marseilles, madame.”
Then addressing D’Artagnan:
“Yes,—Christian and surname are the same.
“I think him capable of everything.”
“My dear fellow, I invited them to a dinner the next day,” replied Aramis.
“Oh, is it you, dear friends?
“The wise man, my child, has said, ‘It is good to think of death.’”
Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.
Chapter 43.
“‘And here is your recompense,’ said the traveller, offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money.
But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp.
“By Heaven!” at last said Athos, the first to speak, “by this time, I think, all must be over.”
If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment, in favor of her august husband, the court of France.
These blunt words, so terrible if taken literally, were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter.
“When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it, you will further say to him: _Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him_.
(At the first words of this address D’Artagnan had seized Porthos’s arm, which he pressed with gradually increasing force.
But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second-sight.”
Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger?
“Pardon me, sir, and attribute this violence to what I suffer.
“Is that what you wish for?” asked she.
The voice and gesture of the man who followed Danglars ordered him to do the same.
While Mercédès, as we have said, was making a similar inventory of her property to Albert’s, while she was arranging her jewels, shutting her drawers, collecting her keys, to leave everything in perfect order, she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage, from which everything could be both seen and heard.
“Stay,” said Monte Cristo, as though he had not observed her confusion, “I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan bonds.”
“Well, you,” said Porthos, “what then?”
“From a good source, sir; I heard it from Friquet.”
“Positively.”
“Hush,” cried Valentine, suddenly; “someone is coming!” Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern, which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it.
But I forgot,” added the Gascon, smiling, “pardon, I forgot you are no longer Athos; but never mind, let us hear your plan for dinner, Porthos.”
“Alas,” murmured he, with intense suffering, “I might, then, have been happy yet.”
“Nothing very difficult.”
“We might start at five o’clock and be in time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night, and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels.
“You hear me—at a quarter past midnight—in fact, in twenty minutes.”
“A fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur!
If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
“No,” said Athos; “Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my opinions.”
“Is it still only an intention, your eminence?” asked D’Artagnan.
Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another year he will be quite so.”
“No, count,” he replied, “I am the only victim in this case.
“Our wine!” said Athos, astonished.
But Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.
You understand?”
We will not go till evening.”
“Hum!
Ah, very well,” replied the cardinal, quickly.
And the king, putting spurs to his horse, set off to the tent of Lord Leven.
D’Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out.
“Then,” said the prisoner, “let’s think who it can be.
Chapter 19.
We will see, my dear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box.”
The whole army talked of this expedition for a day, and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it.
Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous.
“Yes.”
I became angry; he began to laugh, I threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards.
That your mother and M. de Villefort are both coming to this dinner.
Barrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about half of the liquid offered him.
The abbé sank upon Edmond’s bed, while Edmond himself remained standing.
“An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate presence in Paris.
M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man.”
“How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it?” said Athos.
The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity.
“What are you meddling with, stupid?
The door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:
This was more terrible than the first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth contracted and turned purple.”
“I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of France.”
“But,” said Andrea, “if my father had met me, I doubt if he would have recognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me.”
Follow us, Planchet; we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village.”
“Well, sir, and what then?”
“No,” said she, “you will avenge me; but you will not be dead.
“What I have done, Albert.
He soon felt that his ideas became again collected—he could think, and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning.
“You really wish to see her?”
Have you neglected to obtain information on that point?
Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms.”
“I know, father, you are the most honorable man I have ever known.”
As he passed them he said:
“I forgive you.
“Indeed!”
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, lowering his voice, “and you will pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business.”
“Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?”
“I know not, sir, but I thought it really very fine and grand!”
“Half a million,” said he, “magnificent!”
“There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.”
“Tomorrow morning,” answered the innkeeper.
I take charge of everything; be easy.”
“Ah,” said Villefort, with a startling accent; “does she wish that?”
I positively refuse; intrigues terrify me.
I took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count—if he were a real count he wouldn’t be so rich.
D’Artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed quietly.
Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.”
“Yes, and France is about to pay for her king’s refusal with a war.
“You knew I should be killed on leaving this house, and did not warn me!”
“M.
His hat was a little napless, his feather was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces were a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.
This charge was so fierce, so skillfully conducted, that Chanleu was almost surrounded.
“Ah, baron, baron,” said Albert, “you are not listening—what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you!”
“The gate is shut,” said Aramis, “but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees, and perfect seclusion, I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well suited.”
However ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance of their servants, and arrived at Crèvecœur.
“What would you have?” said Monte Cristo; “we are all mortal.
He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.
Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him, as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate.
“Yes, yes,” said Lord de Winter, who perceived what was passing in her mind; “yes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: ‘All is not lost, for that order is not signed.
Teach Bazin prosody; that will console him.
I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet.
“Sir, you alarm me.”
“You are about to see,” said Mousqueton, looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning, “you are about to see, Blaisois, how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty.”
“What is the use of following the alleys?
I have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county, and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around.”
The carriage stopped, the footman sprang off the box and opened the door.
“Stake both, _pardieu!_ I am not selfish, as you are.”
“Let us dispatch,” said the duke.
“I will communicate it to you.”
Peppino had a little spare time, so he had a game of _morra_ with the facchini, lost three crowns, and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.
“Why, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Châtelet, monsieur, named Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still gives herself jealous airs.
“Am I to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if I can use more activity than my enemies.
“My faith, it appears so!” said D’Artagnan.
“One thing only puzzles me, namely, how Franz d’Épinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife.
“But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?”
“Is it possible,” exclaimed Albert, “that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?
30279m
There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her mother’s admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature.
“No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office, as does the Abbé Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke; but your excellency has not read all.”
“Lord de Winter.”
God knows how much I love, revere you.”
Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension?
“Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric.
I repeat to you, however, and this time on my word of honor—I think perhaps too often—that I am in haste, great haste.
in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to Henry III., and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.
“As the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had run,—and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,—the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.
Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal heart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story.
“Of my hundred pistoles?
“And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy?
“I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request.
If you venture again into the house in which I have met you this evening, I will dare it myself.’ I really think I must have been frightened.
“Ah!
After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt, then looked with great complacency at his hands, which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care; and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first, as belonging to the uniform, he put on others of silk only.
“A pretty silence truly!” said the old father of the bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself.
Then the soldier, gagged and bound, was placed upon the hearth, the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends.
In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know, on horseback like himself, followed by a lackey like himself, and going in the same direction that he was.
In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord.
He returned to Mousqueton, but the steward had sold the last wisp.
The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimaud’s hands, but Grimaud shook his head.
But if we do risk being killed,” said Porthos, “at least I should like to know what for.”
D’Artagnan concealed himself in his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the door.
“You are mistaken—I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.”
“Have you, Monsieur le Gascon?” asked Mazarin, supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands.
“I have told, sir,” murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground; “I have told my secret!
“I shall borrow from the queen.”
That’s it!
“Our future, our ambition!” replied D’Artagnan, with feverish volubility.
“A woman of such inferior condition!
“Because she was afraid of compromising you.”
“So,” said Andrea, “you are speculating upon me?”
She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently.
Last year I had four apricots—they stole one, I had one nectarine, only one—well, sir, they ate half of it on the wall; a splendid nectarine—I never ate a better.”
You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation.
“Simpleton!” exclaimed Mousqueton; “suppose any one came into the room.”
“In fact,” said Aramis, “there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly.
Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features.
Still more must be done.
“That is true,” said Mordaunt, “and they will be far from thinking of you.
Two ladies, sleeping in one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man.
“Yes, yes; you have already given me that reason, and I find it excellent.”
Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt his increased importance.
No, you do not know me; I have done all in my power to oppose it.”
“Of hunger, sir, of hunger,” said Caderousse.
“Good!” murmured Milady; “the austere Puritan lies.”
They withdrew to a private house, and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety, they occupied but one room and provided an exit, which might be useful in case of an attack.
“Yes.”
The Gascon, with his vivid imagination, had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation.
In March there was a question about a grant to a railway.
it is God Himself who sent us here.”
This was followed by rather an awkward silence.
Bonacieux, D’Artagnan turned toward her; the poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an armchair.
“Porthos is coming—he swims like Leviathan.”
We are not generally very severe with the Austrians.
“Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say.
“Against whom?”
Suddenly he heard a cry—it was his daughter’s voice.
Since your eminence has come so far, come a few steps further; conduct us, my lord, to the wall.”
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” muttered Mazarin, unable to recover from his astonishment.
I am a man of order, sir; let us do things in order.”
“Did parliament pass this act?” Athos asked of him in English.
Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me?”
“Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?”
At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles.
“Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again,” he reflected, “I would turn it at once into money; I would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father’s chateau, which is a pretty place, well enough, but with no land to it at all, except a garden about the size of the Cemetery des Innocents; and I should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress, attracted by my good looks, rode along to marry me.
Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we will not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of Dantès.
“Certainly, sir; but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of God.”
Two men, to the astonishment of D’Artagnan, appeared shortly; soon, however, his surprise vanished, for he heard the murmurs of a soft, harmonious voice; one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier.
Yes, we will fly; I will confess all to her,—I will tell her daily that I also have committed a crime!—Oh, what an alliance—the tiger and the serpent; worthy wife of such as I am!
The bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.
The jailer came in the evening.
“Sir,” replied the young man, “it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor.”
“Come, then.”
Not at all, my dear sir,’ said La Carconte in her most gracious manner.
And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation, whilst the cardinal, raising his hands clasped toward her, exclaimed, “Ah, madame, madame, how little you know me, mon Dieu!”
“‘As you please, my dear sir,’ said the jeweller; ‘I had, however, as you see, brought you the money in bright coin.’ And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.
The count watched him with a feeling of compassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows:
In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits.
“Is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized?”
Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.
The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.
The coadjutor, whose eyes devoured her slightest movements, seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it, returned to the window and waved it in his hand.
This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the emissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me.
“Impossibility.”
“I thought, perhaps, that the king’s death——”
In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went from thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege.
Oh!
What tenderness, my sister!”
He caused me to be arrested, had me conducted hither, and placed me under your guard.
Boisgoli, tell Noirmont that I have two guests.
Don’t lose a word of what I’m going to say to you, Porthos.
Possibly this one, who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing, has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor.
“I thought I had,” said Porthos, resuming his melancholy air; “but I have been taught my mistake.”
“You have never heard his name?”
Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”
Then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la Fère—”
“I am sure of it.”
But as there was nothing positively certain in this report, the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune, free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary.
Have you not yet divined who he is?”
Well, these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold.
He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness.
“And can you find him?”
I had designedly taken this direction.
“Yes, among your friends of other times; among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him.”
“Oh, very well,” replied Aramis; then bending his face down to Athos’s ear, “what is the object of this visit?” continued he.
His family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him.
Has mankind treated me as a brother?
“What is the matter?” asked M. d’Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it being the hour he usually visited her.
“But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of entry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night.”
“The count,” repeated Eugénie, as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner; “the count?—oh, he is so dreadfully pale.”
Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.
“The Marquis of Saint-Méran!” returned the count.
And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on.
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”
So much the better; the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied.”
Who could intercept us on such a night as this, pitch dark, when one does not see more than twenty yards before one?”
“I heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any crime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no more importance to that event than it merited.”
“Sir,” said Franz, “I have one request to make.”
“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”
“What were you doing there?”
The prisoners, therefore, had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors—which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts.
Chapter LXI.
“By no means.”
‘In whose name do you come?’ said he to him.
The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.
The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-Méran, who had left her bed to receive him, but had been obliged to return to it immediately after.
“What, brother!” cried Milady, “must I name him again?
“Are we quite alone, my friend?”
“Yes, Morrel,” said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man’s excitement; “yes, I would do so.”
I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself.
The Count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the banker’s house.
“I will try to accompany you,” said Aramis, “though I scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback.
“You know him.”
What he?” asked the cardinal.
Why should you expose your game to your adversary?
I never saw a man with a nobler air than his.”
“A charming woman!” said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.
“When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing there’s no need to go over the ground a second time.”
“Devil take these civil wars!
“What, then?”
“The _festa_ was magnificent; not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks.
“No, on my honor,” said Maximilian; “but that will not affect you.
‘Is the committee willing to hear this witness?’—‘Yes, yes,’ they all said at once.
“How far distant?”
The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they did not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful hands of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat.
A waiter opened the door.
“What was his name?” inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccio’s story.
“The gentleman who receives us?
D’Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.
“Must I go too?” asked Valentine timidly.
The countess bent her head, as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts.
“Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,” said Felton, with a gloomy smile.
“Ah, yes, I know.”
“No, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your princely father, is he rich, very rich?”
“At length he interrogates me!” said Milady to herself, at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result.
“Oh, sir!
On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne, it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects.”
The man looked at the bank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale, then red, then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water, but he had no time to reach the water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs.
Look at me, madame—look around me.
“Yes, sir, he had very good ones; but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me, and did not even fight.”
“Thou liest, subtile one,” said D’Artagnan to himself.
Try, Aramis, to keep near the king.
To conspire against my honor with Madame de Chevreuse, Madame de Longueville, and the Condés.”
“In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already as one of the family.”
“Yes, I offered you escape.”
“Where are we going?” inquired Aramis; “are we going to fight, perchance?
Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.
“Oh, yes,” replied Andrea, laughing.
The French government, without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to volunteer assistance.
“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does not last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician; for example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have just become bankrupts.”
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows.
We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance.”
“The great cardinal!”
After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them, the procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his custom, with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else, but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires.
Then d’Avrigny spoke.
The Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the table.
He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch, prepared to hear the result of the proceedings, and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty.
“Yes,” said Caderousse, “but how?”
“That man, then, was not—”
“You may think my departure strange and foolish,” said the young man; “you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one.
“And the monk?” exclaimed the executioner, “did you see the monk?”
In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousse’s letter.
Can I trust in you?”
D’Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, “And Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off?—For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance.”
Would you like to become rich, or at least independent?
Oh, misery, oh, vanity!”
“But,” asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat, “why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French, Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?”
“To whom did he give up his sword?”
They had long since passed to dessert and cigars.
At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance.
This was the costume that best became the king.
Taste of this; it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much of.”
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.
In the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes—gigantic cabbages walk gravely about, buffaloes’ heads bellow from men’s shoulders, dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted, and, as in Callot’s Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely face is exhibited, which we would fain follow, but from which we are separated by troops of fiends.
He turned to brush away a tear, and then, summoning up all his firmness, drew his daughter toward him, recommending her to be pious and resigned.
“Be quiet, you rascal!” said Bazin, looking uneasily around.
“And yesterday evening he came again.”
“Leave us, Germain,” said Villefort.
“Well said, Porthos,” replied D’Artagnan.
“By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?”
You had nothing left?”
He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless with amazement.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” cried D’Artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure, “the thing is serious.
“Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”
What do I know of the Grecian affair?
“Can my influence with them be of any service to you?”
I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.”
“What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position demanded much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s intentions were.
Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to the East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted it.
“A woman of intrigue, who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M. de Richelieu.”
“Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?” said he.
I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen crowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard.
By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology, its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave, as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle.
His wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking.
Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his study, where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter:
Spare me, then, I beseech you.
“That will be frequently, I assure you, for I have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation.”
“Sir!
Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders.
“I should give up Broussel,” said Porthos.
Providence has declared for us, since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner.
“Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.”
When he saw Luigi, he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him.
“My son,” he said to him, “you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here.
Have you seen him lately?”
sermons?
Porthos and Aramis drew back, disappointed, and drawing his sword D’Artagnan turned to his adversary:
Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel.
At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there.
“You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you?
He was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil.
“Or, rather, by instinct.”
“You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?” he asked of Franz.
Where is he?”
“Twenty-five minutes past nine!” cried M. de Tréville, looking at the clock; “why, that’s impossible!”
“Let it pass.
I am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law, Monsieur de Tréville, is particularly attached to their Majesties.

“You stand upon his property!”
When your turn comes, I shall have the honor to inform you of it.
Ah, this visit was expected.
As Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort, “When shall I see you again?” said the latter.
Chapter LXXXIX.
At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle, and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aunay.
There was little change in the cardinal; still dressed with sedulous care, his hair well arranged and curled, his person perfumed, he looked, owing to his extreme taste in dress, only half his age.
M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on his left Morrel.
“I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,” said Lord de Winter.
They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence they came.
Sit down, in mercy!”

“His friends!” murmured Cromwell.
There is but one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely at your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you everywhere; besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you—with your name, and your fortune, and your talent” (Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile) “you can present yourself everywhere, and be well received.
“Do you know what they are saying here?”
However, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.
“Good to eat!” he said, and put it in his pocket.
But we have not done with the thing yet.”
“Diavolo!” said the cardinal, pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration; “I should have cried, I should.”
“Do so, then, but let it be the last.”
“Then what?” asked Mazarin.
But I was unable to accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of Château-Renaud.”
“Yes, madame; only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit.
“Yes, you!
“Maximilian,” said he, “are your affections disengaged?” Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment.
“That is true.
“I would ask for six months’ in advance, under pretence of being able to purchase a farm, then with my six months I would decamp.”
“You here?” said Château-Renaud, passing his arms through the young captain’s; “are you a friend of Villefort’s?
The calumniator is not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my honor, if he thinks so, he deceives himself.”
“Gentlemen,” said Morcerf, “it is only a quarter past ten, and I expect someone else.”
‘Once upon a time——’ Well, go on.”
During all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight o’clock, had been watching his door.
“Yes, that is my companion’s name.
As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation.
The little old man remained at the coach door; the coachman took care of his horses, the lackey held the saddlehorses.
“That is lucky,” said Blaisois.
The governor laughed.
“A serious matter,” said the count, looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him; “and what may it be?”
Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?” Suddenly a light passed over his face, a smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought.
The cardinal made an approving gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming.
“Speak,” said Athos; “we cannot see your signs.
“And what is that?”
“Albert, Albert,” said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof, “what are you saying?
“Ah, yes,” said Faria; “the penknife.
The count smiled.
Well, what have I learned since?
Gad!
The abbé took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.
“So be it,” said D’Artagnan.
He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price.
They looked at the cord, still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground.
“Ah, yes!” said Aramis, “toward him I should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment!
“Has he any friends?” Then he added aloud, “Did he make any resistance?”
50282m
And slowly, though without any hesitation, only waiting to press the count’s hand fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte Cristo.
The host desired himself to serve him; which D’Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced the following conversation.
Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching against the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble.
Oh, you need not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of France.
“That is a tenacious old grandfather,” said Beauchamp.
This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm.
“Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,” said Danglars.
“This moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune, these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality.
THE MAN OF MEUNG Chapter XV.
“I regard them as invaluable.”
“So that, you see, there is a deadly feud between us.”
Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw back.

on!
“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”
“I’faith!” exclaimed Gondy, “you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure; and since monsieur le curé can answer for you——”
The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends, and Athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried in a firm voice, “Who goes there?”
We may well pity the poor fellows!” said the abbé.
Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries; propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out.”
“D’Artagnan,” said Athos, gravely, “I assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that.

Fly, friends, fly!” he added, whirling his sword around him.
“And where is Auteuil?” asked the count.

Oh, oh!” said M. de Tréville.
“Better than that!” replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself.
“Yes; a thousand times, yes!”
Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up.
In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.

Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o’clock in the morning all the cargo was out of _La Jeune Amélie_ and on _terra firma_.
I am not forgotten.
“Will monsieur remain long with us?” asked Mousqueton, with a serene and glowing countenance.
he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.”
The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover, quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed, and he was comforted.
Athos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him returned with joy.
“Say not so,” quickly returned Monte Cristo—“say not so, my friends; angels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be.
“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis.
How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you?”
It was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the house of M. de Villefort.

“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter.”
“Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed?”
“Madame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,” replied the husband, seriously; “she is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties.”

I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit.
“However, your excellency,” said Andrea, “in consideration of Lord Wilmore, by whom I was recommended to you——”

He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class, when Planchet approached and said:
A daughter of Henry IV., of that great, that sublime sovereign——”
The heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after.
“Who is that man?” he asked.
“Forgive me,” replied Morrel; “I will go away.”
“Why, how extraordinary!” said Porthos, slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment, “I understand English, then!
I depend on you.
When he was within twenty paces of it, he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped.
“A very respectable lady,” said Aramis.
you were going to drink my wine?”
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss.
Morrel had thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth.
“Oh, Porthos’s duchess is dressed by her husband’s clerks,” said D’Artagnan, laughing.
With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into that of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and placed all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.

Athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman.
The cardinal, being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time.
“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo.
Danglars was a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed.

“Thanks, monsieur,” said the monk, with one of those smiles that made Bragelonne shudder.

At the end of two hundred years the documents were found, and they thought of bringing up the jars.
“Do you suffer much?” asked the monk.
“And I am so still,” said Porthos bowing to Harrison.

I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.”
Tell me.”
At length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were heard on the stairs.
“My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked Valentine, clasping her hands.
“But at least we shall see her,” said Beauchamp, “or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?”
“D’Artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur, and at the same time leaving some trace of himself.”

“I fully appreciate his delicacy,” said Andrea, cramming the notes hastily into his pocket.
“Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror.

Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath.

M. de Tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow become darker.
“‘Ah, I understand,’ said the lieutenant; ‘and you seek admittance into our ranks?’
Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor.
“Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?” inquired the man, with a strong Italian accent.
“Oh!” said Athos, “oh, no, it is impossible!
“Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other.”
“There may be.
“You speak first.”
This Musketeer had just come off guard, complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.
Serve us up the best supper you can, and especially give us some good wine.”
Thus the day passed away.
He could not help thinking of M. Rochefort, whom he had seen in Notre Dame; could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos?
‘Well, read it; he demands your head.’
The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a complaining voice said: “In the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me?”
We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes; the choice is easy.”
“My lord,” said D’Artagnan, “will lend his, which is of no use to him, to the Comte de la Fere.”
Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Allées de Meilhan belonged, Dantès next proceeded thither, and, under the name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport), purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs, at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been given.

Peppino, turning around, shouted, “A fowl for his excellency!” His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head, without the assistance of his hands.
“What are you meddling with?” cried Aramis, pale with anger, suspecting that D’Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longueville.
“Ah, my dear father!” exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure.
Olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket.

“Let me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,” said Milady, elated.
“Why, yes, I think so—in the street,” said Athos; and he looked smilingly at Aramis, who looked at him with an expression of surprise.
“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_.
That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful apparition.
The count made a sign to Haydée to address his visitor.
Fie!”
“A man who will not tell his name, but who comes from the cardinal.”
The coadjutor, dragged along with his fugitive forces, passed near the group formed by Athos, Raoul and Aramis.
“Let him be conquered, exiled, proscribed, provided he still lives.
No,—but, perhaps, you will permit me to call to mind—stay!”
How fortunate that Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble!”
“Good Caderousse,” he said, “how happy you will be.”

“Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?”
“Ah, very good.”
“I am a priest,” said the young man.
When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this: “We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those 300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again.”
Meanwhile, Grimaud, still mute as ever, drew from the pie the other poniard, the rope ladder and the gag.

But, no!
“_Ma foi!_ what rival?
Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so perilously climbed.

The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange, that Raoul, whose eyes were still fixed upon him, felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult.
“Why didn’t you say so?” said the servitor, opening the gate.
It is on her account I am here; I wish to see Valentine.”
Raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count’s arms.
“Well?” said he in a low voice.
“As for me,” thought Porthos, giving Mordaunt his whole attention, “were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation I would leap down from the bench, reach Mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him; I would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of France.
You are no longer in my service, Monsieur Bertuccio.”
He drew Kitty to him.
and you would be right, my friend; for in losing him you would lose your barony, which you have in your grasp, to say nothing of the fact that, were he once out of this, Mazarin would have you hanged.”
The sergeant put the lantern near the panel.
What did he say to me?
The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of Anne.

“Monseigneur is too good,” said La Ramee, flattered by the compliment.
“True,” said the abbé, with a stifled sigh, “Mercédès it was.”
“Certainly,” said D’Artagnan.
“No.”
Then he passed his hand across his forehead, which was clouded with doubt.
The stranger went out.
“All, sir.”
“Have you seen anything?” they asked.
Take some more of these cigars, M. de Morcerf.”
“Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me.
and why?” asked the old man.
“I have no time to see them.
“Now, my dear count,” he said, “let us on with all the speed we may.
“Ah, sir,” said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the Tuileries, “you entered by luck’s door—your fortune is made.”
Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of wine.
“How dreadful!” said Mercédès, passing her hand across her brow, moist with perspiration; “and that letter——”
The mob dispersed.
In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them.”
“Ah,” said the Englishman, “is it you, my master?

He had passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there.
“I am ready,” said he.
“Fire!” replied the steward.
Albert’s witnesses looked at each other.
“This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly: Your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when the contract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they exchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then, when the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance.”
One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced Beauchamp.
Only imagine, my dear friend.

As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it.
“Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?” inquired Madame de Villefort.
If you have forgotten, as he is still living, I can write to him and he will send me information on the subject.”
Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond’s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them.
“I do not think that such is his intention,” said Morrel.
Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.
The cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound reverie; but he did not return the paper to D’Artagnan.
“You know well,” replied De Comminges, “that there are no prisoners at Rueil, because there is no prison.”

A slight color mounted to his cheeks.
“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”
The friends obeyed.
At that moment he cut it.
“It concerns me much,” said D’Artagnan, “since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since——”
Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemnity.
The next day, just as Debray was signing the deed, that is about five o’clock in the afternoon, Madame de Morcerf, after having affectionately embraced her son, entered the _coupé_ of the diligence, which closed upon her.
“Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood, madame,” said D’Artagnan.
“While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him.”
“Yes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that Dantès did not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted, methinks, and yet Dantès need not die.”
“He will play me some dog’s trick or other, and that immediately,” said Tréville.
The Frenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses, churches, museums, or theatres.
“And so, in spite of M. de Villefort’s promises?”
On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard, then, mounting a staircase, had opened a door, and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk.
A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed him.
“I have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly.”
“No, no; I am here,” said the monk, quickly coming back to him.
Yes, yes!
“What is become of her?
Fool that I was!
The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it.

We traversed Greece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates.
As certainly, Maximilian, as I now press your hand, I shall kill him before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.” Morrel, in his turn, took Monte Cristo’s hand in both of his, and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.
Either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk, the first curé, the first priest you may meet.

“Probably,” said D’Artagnan, “but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold, and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom Lowe, an assistant carpenter and friend of his, to go down to Whitehall, with three of his friends.
So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in.
There is no question, you understand, provided we secure our own interests, of securing those of the Frondeurs; who, besides, don’t understand political matters as we old soldiers do.”
“Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”

Marie Michon, who made the most charming cavalier in the world, pushed open the door, put her head in and asked for hospitality.
“My father, as I told you.”
“Everything depends on you.”
The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count, and left the house.
You have saved my life, and I thank you,” continued Dantès.

“But,” he said, “the count’s generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune.
She passed first.
“He is right,” thought Athos.
Monte Cristo went to the window, and saw them crossing the street, arm in arm.
As to the king, he made no demonstration of politeness, only stopping before the queen.
She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before she expected him in vain.
“He took her for the queen!” said D’Artagnan.
“I have them.”
Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of all.
Before the entrance of the magistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice, on days when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.
The old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of his slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry.
“I do not know, for I have never had it, madame.”

“I never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen apparitions, I don’t believe in them.”
Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries.
The count took into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly presented to him, and read:—
Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen’s carriage.
“Now all that is settled, do let me see the performance, and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms: let him go home and go to sleep.”
Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied.
“And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I believed that woman dead?” asked D’Artagnan.
Come hither, and let us talk.”
“Golden dreams!” cried Aramis.
Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and Mlle.
Chevalier, take my hand; it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh.”
And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party, whose money he managed.
“I have remarked also another thing,” said Athos, “which is, that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched.
“What do you mean?”
“Here I am,” said he.
Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse, whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.
“I believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if God had spoken to me,” said the young girl, presenting her forehead to him.
“Just now,” D’Artagnan continued, “you were disguised—I mean to say, attired—as a murderer, and now——”

“Madame,” said he, “if I dared in my turn advise——”
“Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.
The Prince de Marsillac—my old friend—will recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville, who will give him a letter to her brother, the prince, who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately.”

“General,” said the president, “we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor, but his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his kingdom, by violence and treason.”
He found as provident a host and a fresh horse.
“Far from here?”
“Very well, show him to me.”
Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have this haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this swordplay at the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion given for the cardinal’s Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides, never allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you!
; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house, and in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones, half hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid down, and upon which the water was yet glistening.
At this instant the three friends turned, in spite of themselves, a last look on the rock, upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still.

“See there, now!” said M. de Tréville; “and how the devil did you escape?”
Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner.
“Well, when Dantès was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars, and they were very sad.

“My word of honor, sir,” said Athos.
While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.

Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried Mousqueton, his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy; “Monsieur d’Artagnan!
The door is opened to all who knock.
And the friends, spurring on their horses, rode to the hotel, the “Arms of England.”
But then all this extravagance is not for myself,” added Athos, laughing.
D’Artagnan went straight to the sergeant.
“What is worth a louis?”
“Then you are not consoled?” asked the count, surprised.
I am dying with anxiety.
You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men, and unfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you leave to try them upon this one.
She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread death around her.
‘I can see neither heaven nor earth,’ said the jeweller, who was outside the door.
“Be it so!
It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future.
Besides, it is important,” added he in a low tone, “that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the paper.”
“The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on,” replied Raoul, “that I might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day; let us push on, then, to Noyon; it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from Blois to Paris.
Patience!
After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who, until then, had been occupied on the other side of the house, glide into an adjoining room.
“Ah!
“Of certain expenses he has contracted.”
“Isn’t Mousqueton there?”
The Riot becomes a Revolution.
Albert saw all these preparations and understood them, and exclaiming, “My mother!” he threw his arms around her neck.
During this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests.
The queen entered and D’Artagnan remained at the door.
Let us be on our guard.”
Porthos, who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides, was very cross and questioned D’Artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game.
Who’s up there?” said the man.
She joined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a word.
D’Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation.
‘Lucullus dines with Lucullus,’ that is quite sufficient.”
D’Artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes; it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him.
And Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the liberality of D’Artagnan had not entirely effaced.
He had received in the chest the bullet of D’Artagnan’s first adversary.
“Merely because one might have died,” carelessly answered Monte Cristo.
Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton, though he did not himself wait on the table, which would have been beneath him in his new position, appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to D’Artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served.
For example, here is Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, ‘A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard;’ ‘four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St. Denis’ or ‘the Faubourg St. Germain;’ ‘ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a _café_ on the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,’—and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the Campagna di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes.
And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.
The noise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret.
Gentlemen,” he said, addressing the two musketeers, “accompany the royal carriage, we are going forward to look for lodgings.”
D’Artagnan gave the open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend it, but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time.
“That is true enough,” returned Caderousse.
“Yes, sir,” replied the Englishman.
“I beg pardon,” interrupted Beauchamp; “are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?”
Valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in Noirtier’s eyes.
Several times, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her burning brow.
The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner.
“Listen,” said Morrel; “it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret.
“Yes,” said Albert, blushing.
But please to observe I won back the equipage,” cried Athos.
“Yes, calls himself.”
Fie!’”
The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the door.
When once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept; then suddenly struck with an idea:
The president rang the bell.
Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart.
“Come, dear ones,” said Morrel, rising from his seat, “let us go and see, and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!”
“And how do you like my wine?” asked Porthos; “it is pleasant, isn’t it?”
“What a singular being you are!—you will not interfere in anything.”
“By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”
“Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation seems good.”
“I do not hesitate, you know,” said Grimaud.
“And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us?”
“Why not?”
You cry very loud, you end by doing nothing; you talk of flying——”
The poor girl ventured a glance at D’Artagnan which said, “See how I suffer on your account!”
“I feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other.
D’Artagnan rushed out of the room.
“Aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,” interrupted Porthos.
Then, as the half hour had already glided by, he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal’s door.
‘Oh,’ said he, ‘this is very nice weather, and two leagues to go in such a storm.’
“I pledge you my honor,” returned the count, “that I mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris.”
Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses, and bowing to De Winter, departed.
The Waking
If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be armed—if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey.
Well, we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him.
Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had not expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti.
Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same time with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least in part, if not wholly—not for conscience’ sake, but through fear.
Bonacieux.
“He tells me he served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.”
In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun, since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure.
“Oh, yes, if it be true,” cried the young man, “he shall pay me all I have suffered.”
“Madame, have pity on me,” exclaimed De Winter; “you wring my heart!”
He is not dead, then?”
No.
Queen!
Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London, unknown except to the most intimate of his friends.
“Indeed!”
“Well, what next?” said D’Artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.
“Fix your own hour for tomorrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs.”
“Guilty?
“Well, well,” said the count, “who told you that?”
“In fact,” said Franz, “this horrible scene has passed away like a dream.”
Five millions—a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?”
“No, I do not jest, _mordieu!_ I should like to have seen you in my place!
“We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to Vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment’s hesitation, although there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half.
1.B.
The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank, and put the crown piece in his pocket.
“Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?” said Debray to Franz.
At length the light disappeared.
My shoulder quite burns.”
Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time; and every branch of oak, every gilded weathercock on roof of slates, reminded him that, instead of returning to the friends of his childhood, every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever.
“Never fear, dear friend,” said Porthos.
Maximilian rushed up the little staircase, while Noirtier’s eyes seemed to say,—“Quicker, quicker!”
She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it.
As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness.
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.”
“Sir, I can take my pay at this moment, to the full extent of my wishes.”
Chapter XL.
No, I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse; did you see her after her return from Brussels, after the king’s death?”
“No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine—live to be happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to insure this you must rely on me.”
“You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d’Épinay?” observed Valentine.
have we overtaken them?”
“These people who are looking at us are only merchants,” said Athos, “and are looking more at the cargo than at us.”
Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to D’Artagnan when he passed through her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.
“If this law were adopted, sir,” said the procureur, “it would greatly simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as you just observed) have much to do.”
Well, at a few minutes to seven——”
The Fifth of September
Chapter LXXII.
“Well,” continued the cardinal, in an indifferent tone, “the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman, handsome, young, and clever, who has cause of quarrel with the duke.
The king could not give that order, since at that time he was hardly four years old.”
No, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death!
“Gaspard Caderousse,” rejoined the priest.
“Why, the same we had intended doing three days since—set off.”
On guard!”
“Go, then, and find them.”
“But it seems to me,” said Porthos, “that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you.”
I feel the blood flowing towards my brain.
He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is here now; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune.
“You are joking now,” replied Andrea.
The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another, without uttering a single word; the queen standing near the door, D’Artagnan half out of his hiding place, the king raised on his elbow, ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude, but instead of approaching, the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away.
“I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were drunk.”
“I understand,” said the child, with that jeering smile which marks especially the “gamin de Paris.” “Well, we must wait.”
“I do not at all wonder at it—one cannot think of everything; but, happily, the Abbé Busoni thought for you.”
You are very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear D’Artagnan.
“Him!”
I will be a sailor; instead of the costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat, a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.
“Now,” said the king, “give the word and let us start.”
The gates had opened of themselves, and the king, ostensibly at least, had no other guard at his bed-head but his mother.
You know Anne of Austria; the captivity of Mazarin alone guarantees my life; if you let him go I am a dead man.”
But D’Artagnan had reckoned without the wind.
“What does he want with me?”
Villefort, therefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet.
Since the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house.
“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”
“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.
M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration.
“Colonel, I want to speak to the people.”
“You are aware it will be war, civil war, furious, devouring, implacable?”
D’Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Milady’s.
I, who am going to give you another piece of good advice.”
“What will happen then?”
Through one of the windows of the bedroom, on a line with that in the dressing-room, the count could see into the street.
“Well, don’t be alarmed if I return at one, two or three o’clock in the morning; indeed, do not be alarmed if I do not come at all.”
As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time D’Artagnan was better informed than she was.
“I say we have been here eighty-three hours.”
“How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did?
Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D’Artagnan.
“My friend,” replied Porthos, “I leave fishing to Mousqueton,—it is a vulgar pleasure,—but I shoot sometimes; that is to say, when I am dull, and I sit on one of those marble seats, have my gun brought to me, my favorite dog, and I shoot rabbits.”
“Adieu, my kind friends!
At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.
“Certainly; all the four are at your service.”
M. de Boville was in his private room, and the Englishman, on perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence.
“Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,” said Morrel.
“Fly, then!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whose pity returned as her fears diminished; “fly!”
Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost, astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit.
“No.”
Some unknown enemy—an invisible foe—has done this.”
“Whom am I to take with me?

They carried Valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move or speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack.
He’s not more cunning than De Richelieu was!
She was pale and fair, with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue, languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster.
Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each.
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who continued their conversation.
“No, my lord.
I did not observe it yesterday.”
“My dear little love!
“Haydée,” replied the count, “you know that you are now in France, and are free.”
“The casket would encumber you.
Should Andrea marry according to his father’s views, he will, perhaps, give him one, two, or three millions.
“Oh!” said D’Artagnan, “this is rather warm; it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same person.
Albert entered.
“Capital?—yes—I understand—everyone would like capital.”
“We can find out,” said Grimaud.
“Our companions will be riding-horses, dogs to hunt with, and a fishing-boat.”
Then, should anything appear to merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the _concierge’s_ door, and which merits a particular description.
“Madame,” said he, “I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche, who told me he had the honor of being your servant; this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect.”
“Well,” said Franz to him; “there is the beginning of an adventure.”
I shall die of it; oh, yes, I shall certainly die of it!”
“And Bazin?” asked Athos.
Then D’Artagnan told M. de Tréville a long history about the queen.
The request was granted; and three months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up.
“_Ma foi_, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening; you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars’ piano, to be attacked by Haydée’s guzla.”
oh!
Richelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands.
Why, much the same story.”
“From whom?”
“I was about to say to these gentlemen,” added he, “that I forbid my Musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very dear to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the bravest on the earth.
the son of Marie Michon!
When left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.
You tell me of M. Franz d’Épinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your heart?
Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot.
Porthos was the first who came to himself.
The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars.
But that’s quite enough, gentlemen; please to understand, that’s enough.
It was then three o’clock in the morning.
“Sire,” said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing Villefort to his own profit, “I am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to watch over the south” (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words), “has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king, and so I hastened to you, sire.”
“Excellent; thank you!”
The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door; he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully, looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Louvre.
Mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words.
“Will you speak?” he said.
He hastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion after dinner.
“The general has just blown his brains out,” replied Monte Cristo with great coolness.
“But your mother?” asked the president.
Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard.
“Well, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the Morcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.” Danglars burst out laughing.
In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of Pindus and Olympus.
This example was imitated by the rest, until the room filled silently, as if these men had been the humblest, most devoted courtiers.
They this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.
Your Majesty is bored?
“Ill—”
“Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi’s, and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.”
Villefort, perceiving the abbé, passed his hand across his brow.
Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size.
“The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table—give it to me, Valentine.” Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre.
Stop—but—it is very strange—oh, my God, my head swims!
“This will do,” said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined me, I will make my fortune.
“You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough.
“I have been there, mother,” said Friquet, “but I saw things happen of which Master Broussel ought to be warned, and so with Monsieur Bazin’s permission—you know, mother, Monsieur Bazin, the verger—I came to speak to Monsieur Broussel.”
“The matter is, my lord, that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vincennes.”
A violent convulsion attacked the old man.
That was D’Artagnan’s road, as he was going to the Louvre.
“Yes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you.”
D’Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound bow, accompanied by a most gracious smile.
“My dear count,” said Albert, advancing to meet him, “permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I live, I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life.”
I pardon you, and I weep for you.
“You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my family.”
Valentine shuddered.
“But her majesty has no property,” interposed Aramis.
You know what it is to love, my Lord.
CONTENTS
Perhaps all blood demands some expiation.
They came with their usual promptness, and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night.
They were hungry, and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious.
At last, when Pistache was sufficiently well trained, Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment.
Morcerf’s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow.
“Let us rather kill them!
“I believe, and I repeat it to your Majesty, that the queen conspires against the power of the king, but I have not said against his honor.”
It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos, Aramis, and even the Englishman.
“Not so, if you please, my good friend—not here, at least.
“But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?”
50137m
“I?
“Adieu, abbé,” said the coadjutor, “I am to preach to-morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening.”
“I was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now.”
“You see,” said Lord de Winter, presenting D’Artagnan to his sister, “a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman.
“I saw her this morning, and bade her adieu.”
Oh, I am dying!
“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”
Remember that I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still cherish.
I have made a bargain.”
As next to the queen, she was the most considerable personage of the fête, she was received by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy.
“Did you never see him?”
“But this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel.
This hole communicated with a kind of loft—the space between the floor of the king’s room and the ceiling of the one below it.
“A pane of glass out,” continued the count, “a dark lantern, a bunch of false keys, a secretaire half forced—it is tolerably evident——”
Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion.
“First, madame, who are you?”
“On one’s death-bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one’s own,” said the executioner; and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes.
The Château d’If
“I hope, sir,” said he, “you have no objection to make.”
“Oh!” cried Aramis, “do you see, count?”
He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist, when he started back, exclaiming, “Raoul!”
“And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman?” replied Tréville haughtily.
“But, at least, you will be there?”
“Heigh, sir,” said D’Artagnan, trying to laugh, “do you know we look very much like a flock of silly, mouse-evading women!
Go to!
In addition to this, after a half hour’s conversation D’Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.
We are lost!”
What devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything!
“That’s all right,” said the man; “hop in, and we’re off!
“Well!” said Andrea,—“my servant’s coat and my hat?”
“There is the port,” he murmured.
“Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter, which I have just received?” said the astonished Athos.
What is there, then, behind this wall?
“Let us say no more on the subject; you tell me so, I believe you.
“Yes, my lord,” answered the man.
“Thou must add,” said D’Artagnan, “that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere, and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest, then mention my name!”
On his return from the Vatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation.
I am come, sir, to ask your advice.”
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid.
“Capital!
I thought you were earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as _facchino_ or _cicerone_, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own.
They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider’s pockets, to make him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.”
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “to the Governor’s.”
Still, his sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days, she was sure he was well.”
The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which it had retired to die of old age.
Milady passed her two arms round Felton’s neck, and let herself slip out of the window.
He resembles the old Conventionalist of ’93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, ‘You bend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth.
“What?” asked the host, quite cheerful again.
Numberless groups paraded the streets and, whatever D’Artagnan might think of it, it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect.
“You know about that?” cried Athos, astonished.
“Have you anything to do with it?”
Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion.
“At a few minutes to seven,” returned the duke (suiting the action to the words), “I raise the crust of the pie; I find in it two poniards, a ladder of rope, and a gag.
“Your mother can be of no use to you in this world, Henrietta,” said the lady, turning around.
“Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen.
“No.
“That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of M. de Morcerf.”
Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given.
“Perhaps,” said Athos.
THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS Chapter VIII.
“Egad!” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “your king has thoroughly taken me, and I am quite at his service.”
Monte Cristo descended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his bedroom, situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a little piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had noticed at a previous visit.
“By the Joices, the Prinns, the Cromwells?”
Father and Son Chapter 3.
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not spare him a single pang.
“What?” inquired D’Artagnan.
“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied Danglars.
“But,” said Renée, “this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king’s attorney.”
Mordaunt reflected a moment and, after some hesitation, was about to speak, when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal, whispered:
PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
Besides, he had long known the prince, whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time.
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.
“And you think him capable of being exact?” demanded Debray.
He made a last effort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside him.
“Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me.”
“I mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your apartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom.”
“Felton,” said Milady, with a solemnity full of melancholy, “imagine that your sister, the daughter of your father, speaks to you.
my dear friend,” exclaimed Athos, “how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart.”
“There is myself,” replied Milady.
It was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly, it was the first time he had ever heard of it.
Well, his love is half real, half fanciful.
“My son!” exclaimed Athos, pressing him in his arms.
“But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north?”

I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I shared yours at Rome—I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist _par excellence_; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow more, unless that shadow were feminine.”
As D’Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short.
“Listen to me, sir.
At the sight of the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte’s eyes sparkled with cupidity.”
“But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis?” asked Porthos.
Until this day and for how long a time!—he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness.
“You?” cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, “you are everywhere!” Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek.
“And was this conference arranged beforehand?”
“It is you who are not a woman,” muttered Mazarin.
“No, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.
Thus, while contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment in which she was left, she broke out into sobs and tears.
But she waited in vain.
“Well, you can go out by that door whenever you please; for from this moment you are free as the air.”
Chapter LVIII.
Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded, hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door.
come, one may easily see, vicomte, that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him.
“Yes,” replied Porthos, coughing.
“To how much?” said she.
Give it back to him, sir, and since you have such a man in your service, make him useful.”
Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she returned to consciousness.
“At Armentières.”
“What?”
’Tis easily guessed.
My servants are examining the bodies.”
“What is this?” said Aramis to Juxon.
Now I recollect——”
Chapter XXXVIII.
“Luigi was not mistaken.
“Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.”
Eat heartily.”
“Then,” said Aramis, in his neighbor’s ear, “the conferences are over.
“To old times,” he said.
“When?”
“Yes, madame, here I have a right to do so, for it concerns Monsieur d’Artagnan—-d’Artagnan,” he repeated, in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman.
“No, no,” she vociferated, “no, you cannot wish that!”
You promised to obey me implicitly.
“Yes; but——”
“It is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.”
The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile.
A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcerf.
“Your eminence,” said Comminges, “as I was re-conducting the young man for whom you have asked, he approached the glass door of the gallery, and gazed intently upon some object, doubtless the picture by Raphael, which is opposite the door.
“A small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side, awaits you at the mouth of Charente, at Fort La Pointe*.
“The queen and the duke?” cried Richelieu.
“Jesus!
Will you tell me what you require, in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?”
“I have looked around me,” said Mordaunt, “and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain.”
On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him.
The sentiments you air are certainly fine, so fine that they are superhuman.”
“Nevertheless, I confess I still doubt.”
“Take notice that you are shut up—captured.”
“That is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed further, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife.”
“For fifteen thousand francs?”
Faria bent on him his penetrating eye.
This is not my weakness, I tell you at once; family joys have no charm for me.
A certain emotion, for which he could not account, made the lieutenant’s heart beat: he had no longer the assurance of youth; experience had taught him the importance of past events.
You great people always lose something by scandal, notwithstanding your millions.
“So you were at the races, baron?” inquired the countess eagerly.
Provisions began to fail, and whenever one of the Prince de Conti’s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult, which he put down again, and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues.
“A very simple one,” said Valentine.
“Go on with the lights,” said the inspector.
monsieur!” said D’Artagnan, “I beg you will have a care what you say; for if you utter another word like that, be you marquis, duke, prince or king, I will thrust it down your throat!
“Darling,” replied Valentine, “has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words:
“How!
Grimaud signified his assent.
“You are difficult to please, viscount.”
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan!” cried Mme.
But don’t let us hinder you, Mousqueton; go and perform your master’s orders.
See paragraph 1.E below.
There is in London, I hope, some establishment like that of the Magdalens, or of the Repentant Daughters.
“That is correct,” said the executioner; “and now in her turn, let this woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt.”
“And by whom was he arrested?”
To lose a year, two years, three years, is to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal, perhaps; to return when D’Artagnan and his friends, happy and triumphant, should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her—these were devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure.
“Oh, yes,” said Kitty, clapping her hands, “very willing.”
Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars’ voice, and on his regret, after what he had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous evening.
30055m
All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven!
“And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin, Noirtier.”
The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by D’Artagnan, who accordingly, by an expressive glance, warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution.
Refer to your papers.”
you have spurs.”
My wife and my daughter would die of it!
“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and, fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account.”
“Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers, has escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierre’s bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most things.
“Ah!” cried the duke, “will you not accept any money from me?”
MILADY’S SECRET Chapter XXXVIII.
“Beaten!” said Athos.
The prince read as he hastened on.
“One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an income of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in Paris.”
At this moment hope makes me despise their riches, which seem to me contemptible.
“One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?”
“No, my lord; I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle—Daddy Marteau, as they called him——”
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken.”
Act prudently.”
“Only a few days,” replied Monte Cristo.
I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy—that of being the husband of Mercédès.”
“Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.”
The two friends, after a cordial pressure of the hands, separated.
There seems to be only one thing to do, which is, to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England, and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to enter.”
“And you have returned, have you not?” replied M. Bonacieux, giving to his countenance a most sly air.
At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind, so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war, by his new contributions to its methods, he had also made a revolution at Paris, among the young noblemen of the court, whose natural chief he was and who, in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court, modeled after Bassompierre, Bellegarde and the Duke d’Angouleme, were called the petits-maitres.
“I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you, mademoiselle, solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm, so happy, and so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in your memory.”
“Oh, do not kill me!” cried the bandit.
But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword, I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it.”
“And the next day, Bernajoux.
“He is in safe custody,” answered Villefort; “and rely upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.”
In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality.”
“You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy.”
“Yes.”
“If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be satisfied.”
“What have I done wrong, father,” she said, “that you should take this key from me?”
The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant.
You would have done what I did.”
“Agreed!” shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.
I entreat of you not to go near him—at least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great, pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can nor shall.
Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing.
“Are you a priest?” asked Raoul.
“Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible.
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished?”
I will make you all captains, with good pensions!
I have but little influence now, but all that I have shall most assuredly be his.
As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”
“And her name was——”
The count advanced to meet him.
“The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your antipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself.”
“Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in 1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political face of Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler, I sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly, because I fancied I had found my Cæsar Borgia in a crowned simpleton, who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me.
“Yes,” said Porthos, “I see him.
“‘I am a Gascon,’ said I, ‘only when I succeed.’ The answer pleased him and he laughed.
The young Louis was already dressed, with the exception of his shoes and doublet; he had allowed himself to be dressed, in great astonishment, overwhelming Laporte with questions, who replied only in these words, “Sire, it is by the queen’s commands.”
“But will it not be lost?”
“Ah, ah,” said Gondy, “you will undertake, then, some night, to throw up some ten barricades?”
Besides, this time, my visit has a motive.”
Do what I tell you, and immortality awaits you!”
“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love.
“That is not all,” resumed Lord de Winter.
“Nineteen,” returned Dantès.
Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband.
Bonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their frequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the mercer’s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out continuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the Rue du Bac.
Dantès hastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched tightly together.
“La Chesnaye!”
“Merciful goodness!” whispered Aramis to Athos, “did you see?”
“That’s what I call love!” said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever.
Each of these mobs was led by a chief, one of whom appeared to belong, not to the people, but to the honorable corporation of mendicants, and the other, notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people, might easily be discerned to be a gentleman.
Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos; I shall go and shoot on his estate.
“From whom, then?”
Porthos has, perhaps, sixty thousand francs income.
Comminges began to laugh.
Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated, Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation.
There are many stories related of him, and among them this.
“I shouldn’t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment.
“A physician, a physician,—M.
One day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain you would be life to me.
“I am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked, my dear D’Artagnan.
Give me, therefore, one more day before I invite you; I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality.”
“Lord de Winter!” cried Felton.
Two men, wrapped in their cloaks, appeared.
“Aramis!
here, it is eleven o’clock.
“It is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which makes me uneasy, but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as to be able to get his answers.”
“I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch.
“Then you have no religion at all; I like that best,” replied Lord de Winter, laughing.
What would the patron think?
And yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion, laughter and jests arose from the crowd.
Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances, but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea, he understood.
It was plain, by a paleness still greater than usual, and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face, that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping.
“If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin, we do not understand each other.”
Here are two hundred pistoles, which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs.
In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions.
The state, which is now threatened, would be safe, and you—”
“No,” said Porthos, “I expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who have just sent me word they could not come.
“Diable!” resumed Aramis, “I have little fancy for the sea by day, still less at night; the sounds of wind and wave, the frightful movements of the vessel; I confess I prefer the convent of Noisy.”
Then Aramis, paler than before, but subdued by these words, snapped the serpent blade between his hands, and then folding his arms, stood trembling with rage.
“My cloak,” said Grimaud, from the bottom of the hold.
“Yes.
Bonacieux prophesied.
At this word _she_, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.
“Now,” said Valentine, “you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden.”
“Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before he made this visit to Paris?”
Bazin wore his dress, it may be observed, with equal dignity and saintly propriety.
“No.”
“Gad!” replied D’Artagnan; “he has already given me good information and he may do the same again.”
“She was married?” asked Aramis.
I furnished myself with a light.”
“And what was he saying?”
D’Artagnan pretended astonishment.
“You are very humble today,” remarked the governor; “you are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the turnkey.”
And he gave him his hand.
“So from that time, monsieur,” continued the latter, “we have led the most miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all our provisions are in the cellar.
The face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this precaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against him, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent Mme.
“She did well to die, poor girl!”
What does it signify to you if I am murdered?
Monte Cristo opened the carriage-door, Morrel sprang out on the pavement, Bertuccio was waiting on the steps.
Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pistache.
“Can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?” said Athos.
“Peccato!” said Mazarin, writhing beneath this simple eloquence, “your majesty does not understand me; you judge my intentions wrongly, and that is partly because, doubtless, I explain myself in French.”
Conclusion.
“And the other one?” demanded the count.
A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted tapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head.
He did so, and thus doubled his income.
Monsieur had just retired, and the youthful Louis, remaining the last, was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle, a game which delighted him much.
“Were you afraid, Raoul?” asked the count.
“My jailers and my hangmen!
“I feared it, Maximilian,” said she; “it is the counsel of a madman, and I should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the word ‘Impossible, Morrel, impossible!’”
The duke waited until midnight, turning on his mattress like St. Laurence on his gridiron.
“No, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but you see I make no resistance.”

“And you——”
Pardon me, then, a fault which is perhaps great, but which certainly was involuntary.”
“And who knows it?” Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out.
“Who went out this morning?” Athos asked, uneasily.
In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard, and the carriage stopped at the door.
At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had obtained charge of the fortress at Ham.
“Yes; but they may catch him yet.”
“Well, well,” said Monte Cristo quietly, “I see you wish to quarrel with me; but I would give you one piece of advice, which you will do well to keep in mind.
“What is that noise?” demanded Milady.
“‘A quarter of an hour,’ was the reply.
D’Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d’Arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived Aramis, chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that M. de Tréville had been so angry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see him.
“But,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, “you are going to get us all killed without mercy.”
At this instant they heard the sound of horses’ feet.
The count, with a smile of profound tenderness, extended his hand, and she carried it to her lips.
Saying which, he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to Puritans.
“By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business with you alone.”
D’Artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air.
Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton’s steps, and rising quick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees.
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, “I want for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be depended upon.”
Aramis continued:

The next day came and passed, the day after, a week; I then wrote to the cardinal.
“No, no!
“Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?”
The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody, monseigneur.”
I won’t have him killed—I won’t!
If you know Monsieur de Tréville, you must have visited him?”
We are gentlemen; we are, both of us, able to kill you and your eight men—we two only.
Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty.
“Ah, ah!” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Porthos?”
When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all, friends and foes; and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell.”
This time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone, “My dear friend, do not forget that I wish to belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities.
“Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the Sainte-Marguérite islands.
“Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter,” said Aramis, “is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel.
For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the elixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost instantaneously——”
“Do you think it is time for us to enter the service?”
During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent.

When he had concluded his speech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert, turned his back upon him, and went to the press-room.
At the same time, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.
He was hungry; he supped, he went to bed.
Contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided, there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute.
Here Aramis paused.
“‘“It is this:—‘I swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and ten o’clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this oath.’” The general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then, overcoming his manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath, but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members, who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which he did.
The number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of July that—”
Albert remained silent and wrapped in thought.
She had the less motive to resist, resistance would make so much noise.
But the first was repugnant to him.
“You seem incredulous,” said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French.
“My poor girl, you know him already.”
Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?”
I don’t know much about it,” said Athos.
“So much the worse, and so much the better!”
As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door.
That, it seems, is where he meditates on state affairs.”
Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, Dantès proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop.
“But not mine, mother,” replied Albert.
But this I know, that I had a mother, that five men leagued against one woman, murdered her clandestinely by night—silently—like cowards.
Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais, which we four, with our four lackeys and twelve dead men, held out against a whole army.”
“But,” said Aramis, “if I understand rightly we are to kill them all, eh?”
“But where can I wait?”
He was called count, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his father’s immense riches, buried in the quarries of Saravezza, were a constant theme.
These were the first words he had spoken.
“I know it sir,” replied Monte Cristo; “but when I visit a country I begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as, perhaps better than, they know themselves.
“And that means,” replied Monte Cristo, laughing, “that you had, probably, just dined together.
Are you mad, Emmanuel?
I will have three _fleur-de-lis_ embroidered on it in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.”
“I might not always be content with that answer,” replied the visitor, “for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home.
FOOTNOTES:
Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks.
She soon whispered to her husband:
May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with an introduction to your daughter?”
The queen, although astonished at this language, to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers, argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which D’Artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project.

“Give me some water and ether.
what is yonder?” cried D’Artagnan.
I am a straightforward, simple man; that’s my great disadvantage.
“As happy as possible; and yet, sir, you may make me even happier than I am.”
Always the same—always the child’s corpse, coming every night in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture.
At these words Bertuccio turned pale.
“Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet.
I defended the king.”
The next morning, at nine o’clock, he entered Franz’s room, followed by a tailor, who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm; they selected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days.
“No,” replied the count; “I take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in me.”
“Why that question, my dear host?” asked D’Artagnan.
She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others.
As for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food.
“Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”
In the course of his morning’s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass, a discovery that quite delighted him.
The confidence with which D’Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was the name of this minister of the minister.
“Whether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber, and detained her all day.”

He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds, and resided on his new estate.
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly.
There could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal.
Save the king, and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world, leave me the hope that we shall meet again, when I may be able to thank you myself.
“And what did he say, or rather do?” Ali placed himself in the light, so that his master might see him distinctly, and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes, as Noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying “Yes.”
Comminges smiled; Mazarin read and construed that smile.
“Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity.”
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.
“I will confess to you, Albert,” replied Franz, “the count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions.”
In the meantime, follow me.”
“But they will run against the bottom of the ladder.”
“Maximilian!” she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her, that she repeated it—“Maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?”
The whole population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.
Adieu, Paris, adieu!”
All that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator’s wife.
Will that do?”
The prince, Monsieur de Retz, the Duc de Beaufort, the Duc de Bouillon, are talking over public affairs.
“Well, since the best motives are liable to misconstruction, the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal—a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal; yes, her majesty the queen——”
Two shots were fired at once, one by D’Artagnan, the other by the adversary of Porthos.
“I came to tell you.”
At the centre window, the one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino, beneath which Franz’s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the Argentina.
His Grace the Duke of Buckingham _will not set out_ for France.
You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the _mazzolata_ still remains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is very simple.
One day the old man fell ill and died.
“Yes; you said you had an idea,” said Athos.
“You might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_, who gained the prize in the race today,” replied Franz; “and then moreover, what could happen to him?”
The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter.
The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes.
“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know if she is to accompany you, sir?”
The tocsin was sounded.
“Mother,” exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to build my plans upon.”
“Perfectly just,” cried the other two Guardsmen, “the judgment of King Solomon!
They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports; meanwhile we shall reach London with the king.
I may as well blow my brains out, and all will be over.”
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near which Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two words, _your Mass_, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the officer.
“Well, then, madame, not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants, all of them automata who do not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move, nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured, irritated man, who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days.
“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone and was named Teresa.
“Your excellency,” said the captain, “that was the land signal, will you answer yourself?”
The two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.
You must stop at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one tavern—the Shield of France.
“Perfectly.”
“Why,” replied Milady, embarrassed, “why, by the title of friend.”
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of Morrel on her shoulder, “do you not see how pale she is?
She gave him some slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him down the stairs.
Albert stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes.
“Yes.
“Should I go, I shall be delighted to see you there.”
“Porthos,” said he, “kill this fellow for me with a single blow.”

“Speak,” said the duke.
He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat, on the top of which he met De Rochefort.
“What are you thinking of, D’Artagnan?” he began.
Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute?
He would be condemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life.
“This way, this way, my dear Albert!” said he, holding out his hand to the young man.
“Stay,” he said, “M.
“Bah!” said Porthos, looking around.
Andrea was supported by two priests.
“And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful, are they?” asked Franz somewhat incredulously.
“Ho, friend!” said Benedetto.
“The queen, do you say?”
In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon.
No.
“I invent nothing, madame; I create nothing.
“Indeed!”
“Oh, pardon me, pardon me!” cried she, sinking upon the shoulders of Milady.
“Return immediately to Paris.—J.
“Then the thing is easy.
But I am eager to see our young vicomte.
“What do you mean?” asked the king.
Kitty was but too well aware of that.
When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, “My dear count,” said he, “allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelor’s apartment.
The Rain of Blood
“Well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?”
Oliver Cromwell.
“Well, well,” said one, “the madman has gone to look after his treasure.
A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services.
I had acted hastily towards him.
“You are right; but what are you going to do until this evening?
“But the diamond I gave you yesterday?”
Not a word about the sapphire.
But how do you mean to pass your time till I come back?
“Let us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets of paper.”
Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend left—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.
“Haydée—what an adorable name!
Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead.
“My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my satisfaction.”
“I fear I am committing a great imprudence.”
Hold,” continued D’Artagnan, turning toward the door, which had just opened, “here is Monsieur du Vallon, who comes with his coat torn.”
Mousqueton’s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the host’s horses, had bled Mousqueton’s.
Chapter VIII.
“Ah!
ah?
This is what I shall do; I will wait until the very moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M. Franz may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it,—nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned.
Now for the tally-ho.”
“Well,” he said, “all you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.”
“Oh, monsieur, if I could believe I might trust in your discretion.”
“Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?”
She was at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while Kitty was assisting her mistress.
I will aid you in many ways, but without attaching you to my person.
Bonacieux, “you speak that in a tone that frightens me!”
D’Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthos’s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive.
“She gave it to me herself.”
Bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man.
As the Inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him.
“Monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm.
Two Angelic Faces.
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.
“‘Oh,’ returned she, ‘it was a gift of heaven.
A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID
“There’s not a moment to lose; now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel.”
“I would say that I know this great lady.”
The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
Parry, for his part, will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened.”
“You’re wrong.
He asked what was going on.
All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.”
If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of flame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain.
In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had won, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne—if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance.

Well, I wait patiently, do I not?”
“I, doubtless, wrote.
A Signed Statement
Egad!
Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of bank-notes.
“Tell him,” answered the brave man, “to let the king know that they have not killed me outright.
Bonacieux, he could obtain no intelligence of her.
“Yes, but I?” said Mordaunt.
“Not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.”
“The man whose house you have just left?”
“Go, sir, I command you!”
“And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?”
Mousqueton heaved a deep sigh.
“How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?” asked Monte Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity, that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance.
“You are always right,” said the music teacher, seating herself by the side of her friend.
Then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.
Yes, I recognize it!”
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.
I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching.
“_Dentro la testa!_” answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied by a menacing gesture.
This man had seen Valentine, and spoken to her!
“As for me,” replied Athos to this recital, “I am quite at my ease; it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit.”
“Yes,” continued the queen, “I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince, and I wish to know your name.”
“Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer?”
“With what view?”
“No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell me, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind.”
“How can you know that?
The hostess threw herself at his feet, asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence.
This succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the Musketeer toward the procurator’s wife.
“Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen.
At twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting, returned home.
All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck.
20335m
“Rest yourself first, my lord, and we—we will reflect.”
I don’t very well know.
“I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.”
She crushed the paper in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she cried, “What is this letter?”
Ten other carriages followed, containing the ladies of honor, the officers of the royal household, and the court.
A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it, with which he urged on his slow team, was walking with the cart.
Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution.
The procurator’s wife waited tremblingly.
Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first comprehend this restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened her.
La Ramee adored his wife and children, whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall, when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat.
“Aramis, Aramis!” cried D’Artagnan, looking at his friend with an air of doubt.
No nonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them.
“At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp.
“Besides,” added he, “if the smell of their roast meat tempts you, I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.”
Well, Planchet, how is the good Monsieur de Wardes?
“Have you brought it?”
Chapter LXXXIII.
A few seconds afterward D’Artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.
Kitty breathed a second sigh.
This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor.
“Well, young man,” said he, “we appear to pass rather gay nights!
The host will tell you I have three or four more, so that you will not inconvenience me in any way.
I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three!”
Caderousse quickly performed the stranger’s bidding; and after pouring some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbé, resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty glass on the table:
“Let him enter,” cried D’Artagnan; “let him come up.”
As for our two prisoners, you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation.”
“Noble and unhappy king!”
Winter, give the necessary orders.”
D’Artagnan was secretly touched with remorse, not at inducing Porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy, for Porthos, in the title of baron, had his object and reward; but poor Mousqueton, whose only wish was to be called Mouston—was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was?
“Hum!” said the major.
The soldiers were complaisant; they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it.
Parry bent his head and whispered to the king: “It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends.”
And the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.
The procurator repeated several times, “Ah, Madame Coquenard!
In the first horseman she recognized D’Artagnan.
“On the first story, do you see, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the drawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a dressing-room.
“‘To whom, then?’—‘To your new master.’
A carriage had been sent to meet him, and the gigantic Porthos, who stood a head above the entire rabble, soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching.
It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it.
“Yes.”
“Oh, sir!” exclaimed Raoul, recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix, “spare him!
I will come and ask mine at eleven o’clock this evening.
And as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or three savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the woods.
This something was enveloped in a cloak, and D’Artagnan at first believed it was a man; but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and the indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman.
A change of ideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on the kaleidoscope.
I hope to kill all four of you, but I am more likely to kill the first than the second, the second than the third, and the third than the last.
Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one’s self and the walls—walls have ears but no tongue; but if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.”
The arms of D’Artagnan fell powerless by his side.
By no means!” said D’Artagnan.
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal.
Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had occurred.
But, first of all, how are Madeleine and Antoinette?”
He rode on, convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive.
There still remains that of Bernajoux, but you must not be too confident.”
One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.
So he was called the queen’s invalid, with a pension of fifteen hundred francs.
“Come—you understand me; but that with——”
When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal, the child, who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius, enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander’s feats of arms, frowned and looked at his mother.
“Oh!” muttered Porthos, shaking his head, “never should I have thought this of him!
“Yes, your excellency,” said the captain, “we have reached it.”
“You say so.”
“Indeed, I fear it,” replied Andrea, in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valère reply to Alceste21 at the Théâtre Français.
Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without which you could not for a moment exist?”
The wounds that I make are better than that—witness the executioner of Bethune, my uncle and King Charles.

“Would you assassinate me, sir?
An officer, as he spoke, entered the apartment.
“I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved not to send the money, but to take it to him myself.
“Indeed!
FATALITY Chapter L. CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER Chapter LI.
“No.”
“Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by putting the dots to the _i_, or rather by naming the persons.
“‘Emmanuel,’ returned my sister, ‘the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel.
“Yes.”
“Didn’t I say that your police were good for nothing?”
“Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man.
Chapter VII.
Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very pale.
Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.
I missed her by twenty minutes at St. Omer.
Well, wait for the miracle I hope to accomplish, or——”
’Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but,” added he, drawing out his watch, “in an hour and a half she will be.”
“Listen!
“That’s unfortunate.”
He heard hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying:
“I am glad of it.”
Just as he turned, a hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed:
Blood and anger mounted to his face; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.
“Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you, instead of at the head of twenty men?”
At the sight of D’Artagnan, who entered the courtyard on horseback, Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken.
Porthos effaced himself against the wall, but he could not render himself invisible; and the man in the cloak said to him, giving him his lantern:
Although D’Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon distinguished her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign accent, and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words.
It was not long before they joined the escort.
“‘Sdeath!” cried he to the coachman.
“From whom?”
Give me your arm, and let us go.”
“I admire all that is beautiful,” returned the young lady.
Take care, I repeat to you, take care.
“Listen, M. d’Avrigny, listen!”
“Well,” cried Milady, in a sharp voice.
On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o’clock in the morning, as Lent begins after eight at night.
“I,” said Porthos, “I will do whatever you please; and besides, I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very good.”
“Ay, there’s no fear in the daytime; but at night?”
in the name of Heaven!” cried the poor tutor.
“Yes,” said he.
“What are you going to tell me?”
The poor man’s eyes filled with tears.
“Who has told me this fine story, monsieur?
“Alas!” murmured D’Artagnan, “our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever!”
The sweat started forth on Dantès’ brow.
“But the three millions?”
D’Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded man, who was as pale as death.
Where, then, could he be, if he had entered his mother’s room and not since returned?
It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other.
I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercédès.”
There is no God; there is no Providence—all comes by chance.”
“No, no!” exclaimed Debray; “that girl is not his wife: he told us himself she was his slave.
“No.”
For soon, perhaps, I shall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to me.”
The young man went to her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.
“No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will have the article contradicted.”
But D’Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age, dressed simply, but in perfect taste, entered the room, raising, as he came, his hat, adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers.
I will make Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you like, send him to you to brush your shoes.”
They are the Count of Château-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray, private secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an editor of a paper, and the terror of the French government, but of whom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in Italy, since his paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis.”
And Athos sprang into the boat, which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers.
“Ah!
I doubt it.
“What has happened?”
“That is all.”
“No,” said Monte Cristo, “which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious,—it is in the country.”
Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement.
“Madame,” said the young man, bowing; “I can refuse nothing asked of me thus.
“He is a hero, sir.
“To-day—this morning; so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose!”
Thus armed, the count held the lives of five men in his hands.
He remained motionless, but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury.
“There, Edmond Dantès!” he said, pointing to the bodies of his wife and child, “see, are you well avenged?”
Ali had received his instructions, and went down the Corso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio, and reached the gates of St. Sebastian.
“And what is that?” asked Milady.
Come, gentlemen, come.”
And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of Morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so long rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed.
Sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their journey.”
I have a post by which I live; at the death of Monsieur de Tréville, who is old, I may be a captain, which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gascon.
“Yes, and to the point.
The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon.
“Shall I take any arms?”
“Compose yourself, madame,” said he; “all danger is over.” The woman looked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still continued insensible.
“I swear to you, Monsieur Commissary, that you are in the profoundest error, that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do, that I am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has committed any follies, I renounce her, I abjure her, I curse her!”
“Well, then, try.
Mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make D’Artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding, so he gave up, for the time, the discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing.
“And you will have nothing to fear on your return?”
“Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo has received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?”
You must hope for us both, Maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.”
“Come in, come in,” said Albert, rising and advancing to meet the young man.
“Do you know the house of Thomson & French?”
Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to him.
He found a young shepherd watching his flock.
Without communicating his thoughts to his companion, he sat down, drew out his opera-glass, and looked another way.
“I could live——”
In ten minutes after the strangers had departed, Franz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the manner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators.
“I say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who desired me to drink it.
Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who knows, some friends to reward.
“Why so?”
“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the Château d’If.
The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.
Every one arose.
Then she suddenly cried, “Oh, no, no!” rising and retreating to the very wall.
Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:
“That’s true,” said the procurator’s wife, groaning, “that unfortunate outfit!”
“600,000—700,000—800,000—900,000?”
Athos and Aramis were more and more astonished.
Women weep for the dead; men avenge them!”
“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”
“With me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a gentleman.”
“Indeed,” answered Maximilian; “and what did your father say then, Valentine?”
I must divert my attention!”
“Join the escort!” cried Aramis.
You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard, so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly.
“Thank you, sir,” said d’Avrigny; “since you have commenced your sacred office, deign to continue it.
“I said a million,” replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.
From a distance they perceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking out, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.
The cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.
This door was a mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free, and, like that famous portal in the _Arabian Nights_, opening at the “_Sesame_” of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world.

Am I allowed to repeat it?”
“Edmond,” said Mercédès, “I have but one word more to say to you.”
“My dear Albert,” replied Franz, “I am glad of this opportunity to tell you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian women.
“Are you sure of what you assert?”
And then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by tears.
Milady answered by a glance which said, “Is that all?—speak, then.” And then accompanying the glance with explanatory words, “That is but too just,” said she, tenderly.
Porthos pressed his friend’s hand and said to him:
Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him.
I have almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms.
“Well,” said Morcerf, “for three days I believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or Poppæa, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a _contadina_, and I say _contadina_ to avoid saying peasant girl.
I felt my strength fail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail, but my swoon.”
at midnight, my lord.”
“Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.”
I have accustomed myself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son, I will sacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune.”
Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.”
Albert could not see the face of the countess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head, and which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered.
Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.
The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haydée.
“Ah!” said Mazarin, with admirable suavity, “could I but find such men!”
They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place, but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud, they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime-trees.
But you, general, were you not at Whitehall?”
The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal—has, with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalais’s throat cut, under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry Monsieur to the queen!
“‘And when did he set out?’
Swear first, on your honor, not to inform him of our return.”
Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene, mene, tekel upharsin_ of Belshazzar.
War between England and France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly sailors were having a carousal.
I recognize you perfectly.”
And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down again on the cushions.
Happily for him he has ceased to bear that name.”
That depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me.”
“Just as you please, my lord.
At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dantès seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair.
During the darkness, as before, my supper was brought.
“I hasten to comply with your excellencies’ wishes; only, I tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.”
40274m
“Upon my honor.”
“If you wish it.”
She advanced some steps towards the staircase, and listened.
Then Caderousse sat astride the coping, and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend, or rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise.
“You promise to become one of the lights of the Church.
’Tis well.
The cardinal envied that composure, which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself, that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage.
The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed.
“Thanks, my brave friend!” cried Milady; “and when shall I be avenged?”
“Yes, monsieur, one-and-twenty years ago; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times.”
“Bring him to see me.
“To let me sail first.”
“Nearly so.”
“That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres?”
“But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of Great Britain, and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore?”

“Are you sure we are on the right track, lieutenant?”
“Say on.”

Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me; and that you may not forget me, take this!” and she slipped a ring from her finger onto D’Artagnan’s.

With folded arms, he gazed for some time upon the great city.
Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream.
“You don’t choose to discover yourself, because you are the leader of an ambuscade,” returned D’Artagnan; “but with regard to myself, who am traveling quietly with my own servant, I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name.”
Noirtier closed his eyes.
“You are right,” cried the gentleman; “begone then, on your part, and I will depart as quickly on mine.” And bowing to the lady, he sprang into his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses.
While he was listening to this recital, delivered with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment, as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence, courage, and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years.
D’Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example.
She heard him enter, but she did not raise her head.

“Yes, sir,” returned Julie.
“Do as you like,” she said, “I rely upon you.”
“That evening,” continued Bertuccio, “I could have killed the procureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden.

Gentlemen,” he said to his escort, “withdraw.
But I swear to you, before God who hears us, that if you betray me, and my enemies pardon me, I will kill myself, while accusing you of my death.”

“In that case, my dear friend, if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose; the drum beats; I observed cannon on the road; I saw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville; certainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton, as the Duc de Chatillon said.”

There remained Athos and D’Artagnan.
Patrick!” cried the duke, opening the door of the chapel, “Patrick!” His confidential valet appeared.

During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state, Valentine’s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man’s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted.

“No, for Porthos will pay you.”
Anne, reclining in a large easy-chair, her head supported by her hand, her elbow resting on a table, was looking at her son, who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures.
This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made a sign with his eye and hand for D’Artagnan to follow him.
“That’s my room,” replied Groslow.
“And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?”
“He calls me his dear Monsieur,” said the mercer to himself.
“In that case go and get ready.
Whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions, the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak, came and stood just before the hogshead, behind which Grimaud, on hearing him come in, instantly crept.

“But,” said the agitated mercer, “do me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while I am in prison?”
Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife.
Oh, look at me closely, and discover, if you can, even the semblance of a reproach in me.”
“I was worn out with fatigue.
His eyes remained open and menacing.
M. Noirtier, although almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character.
The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur.

As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour, D’Artagnan returned.
Porthos and Aramis arose.
“‘I have no reply to make,’ said the count in a low tone.

“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at liberty.”
“You shall see.”
“Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”

Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open before him.
Why didst thou take it?”
“You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you more.”

The Secret Cave
“‘What do you mean?’ added Caderousse.
“Yes, you are right; I should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness.”

However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song, Milady thought she heard a profound sigh.
“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs!
Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germain.
Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud; but after a moment’s silence, he continued:

The young men first approached the dead man.
“Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling _incog_.”
Milady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence.
“And when will the dance begin?”

Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed it on a stand, then went straight to the secretaire, felt the lock, and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing.
Bonacieux, mechanically, “yes, let us be gone.”
“Alas, dear friend!” said Aramis, “our late adventures have disgusted me with military life.
“Really!” said D’Artagnan, abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts, “Athos, I cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that way.
Take twenty-five of them, Aramis, and give me the remaining twenty-five.”
“And that?”
“Is your excellency really in earnest?” inquired the steward.

“I have to pay a visit this evening,” replied he.
The duchess remained a moment stupefied; then, suddenly bursting into laughter:
“I don’t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy.”
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow, “it’s all your servant’s fault; your stairs are so polished, it is like walking on glass.”
Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?”
“No, sir.”
The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage, and the king and monsieur took their places at her side.
“I know no one in Paris, Morrel, on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother Emmanuel.
“That will do—that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements.

“Monseigneur,” said Marshal de Grammont, with a radiant face, “will your highness permit my son, Count de Guiche, and his traveling companion, Viscount de Bragelonne, to come in and give news of the enemy, whom they have found while we were looking for him?”
Having thus spoken, D’Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village.
“I believed that Madame loved him.”
“The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.”
“But no matter; since it is at the same time the opinion of D’Artagnan and of Athos, it must be the best.”
“Well, then,” cried D’Artagnan, “pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the walls.”
“Oh!
“No, my lord, but he will be,” answered the guard.
“But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.”
“Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.”

“And you,” said Athos, “you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winter’s name.
“I recollect!”
“Here is M. Franz d’Épinay,” said he; “you requested to see him.
Then I should like to have three sons; I should make the first a nobleman, like Athos; the second a good soldier, like Porthos; the third an excellent abbé, like Aramis.
But since then everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave difficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own free will, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me in my career.
I was taken to Versailles; for three months I struggled with death; at last, as I seemed to cling to life, I was ordered to the South.
My mind was already made up.
At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching.
“Yes, the queen!
“I demand admittance,” said a loud voice outside the room, “in the name of the law!” As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal.
For a moment Dantès was speechless; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada.

The host shook his head.
Chapter XXVI.
They then determined to depart.
Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the name of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count’s coronet.

“Lead me into the queen’s oratory,” said D’Artagnan, “announce to her I am here, and put this parcel, with a well-loaded musket, under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair.”

The steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a bundle of bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there.
“Do you return to Paris?” asked Athos, quickly.
‘Penelon,’ said the captain, ‘I think we are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.’ I gave him the helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water.
“Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.”

Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed, turned around, and looking insolently at the Frenchmen, passed some jests from one to another.
At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door, the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday.
The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristo’s door.
He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by provoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful themes of discussion.
“I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow me, I will pay you a visit.
“What!
“Ah, madame,” he said, “why did you not make that request of me?”
I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.”
Near the bottom of the ladder, when he found no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length, arrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists, and touched the ground.
“Take care, madame,” said the young man, coolly, “you will kill yourself in jumping.”
“For my part,” said Porthos, “I desire to be made a baron.”
“It was, indeed, a flight which my father was trying to effect.
1.E.5.
“Nothing—I was speaking to myself.
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place.
“So much the better,” said Athos.
But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended this money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds.
My child, my darling Edward; speak to your mother—open your dear eyes and look on me once again!
“I think so.”
Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?”
“To London!” cried Porthos; “and what the devil are we going to do in London?”
Chapter LIII.
I felt pain; I wished to cry out, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I fell lifeless, and fancied myself killed.
Ah, these Musketeers of yours are very devils—fellows to be hanged.”
“Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to Turin, from Turin to Chambéry, from Chambéry to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and from Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.”
The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent.
The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on his horse against one of them.
Queen, destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth, hear the result of our unhappy mission.”
“D’Artagnan,” said Athos, “this is no joke, I trust?
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.
At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion.
Then the figure, from whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held it up, as if to test its transparency.
Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it.
“Ah, I recognize you—I recognize you!” exclaimed the king’s attorney; “you are——”
pass,” replied D’Artagnan.
“Now,” said Morrel, “do you wish me to retire?”
Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city, which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and recalling the saying of Louis XI., his political predecessor, as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of Tristan’s gossip: “Divide in order to reign.”
“Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?”
I will repeat them, then; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be faithful to the trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.”
And, as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper, whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhône from which it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a hundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful description.
“Here!” said Milady, placing a bag full of louis in Felton’s hands.
“No, madame.”
All at once he uttered a terrible cry.
“No, my lord; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in France.”
Athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd.
You remind me of my fright!
Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the door-bell.
“I thank you, gentlemen,” said he, “for having complied with my request; I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship.” Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached, and remained at a short distance.
“What a wrist you have, reverend sir!” said Caderousse, stroking his arm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; “what a wrist!”
Mazarin made no reply; he reflected.
“Does the count know what answer you received?”
“How!
“He led the enterprise.”
I understand, Bertuccio has been sent by my protector.”
They all mounted the horses as quickly as possible.
Examine the past and the present, and endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a divine instrument.
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or rather the wish to fascinate.
Franz gave him Albert’s letter.
Total......... .............. .............. ............ 114 frs.
“I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I could do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before.
Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.
Let us come to some conclusion.
“The ninny!” murmured Mme.
“But with what motive have you learned all this?” inquired Villefort, in astonishment.
Read it.”
Let me meditate and consider.”
The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.
This duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.
He bowed with great friendship to the count.
“What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?” asked Franz of his host.
“Oh, nothing worth speaking of,” said Morrel; “M.
“I know not who can have uttered the cry,” said the king, “but the noise is easily understood.
Morrel looked obedience to her commands.
D’Artagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness; then turning to Mazarin:
Aramis saluted, then turning toward Athos:
“Do you think so?”
Perhaps he will be young, strong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have been but a hindrance.
“Is Monsieur Aramis with D’Artagnan?” asked Lord de Winter.
“You are mad, dear friend.”
She tried to be agreeable, and she was charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality.
“But what?”
“Then it is Danglars.”
“Yes, but on one condition—that we begin by the coadjutor.
Why, did not the countess, the proud Mercédès, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the garden, into the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?”
“Madame,” replied Villefort “I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority.
I succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of France.
Danglars’ watch, one of Breguet’s repeaters, which he had carefully wound up on the previous night, struck half past five.
“Thank you,” said Andrea; “I will let you know a week beforehand.”
When I live at Auteuil, you must come there, as you belong to my service.”
“Yes,” said Athos, “and the marechal has often told me so himself.”
“Oh, of many things!” said Porthos.
“Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.”
He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo.
“I swear to you, princess, that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized——”
I have resolved to fly with you, not a word—be ready.
Comte de la Fere, you wish to perish by his hands!
“He is going with me.
“Nor I,” said Madame Danglars; “but you began a sentence, sir, and did not finish.”
His features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek.
“Yes, why?”
“Become of whom?” replied Aramis.
The interests of the French crown, endangered at this moment, are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation.
He made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes.
Lean upon me, and let us return to the camp.”
Perhaps, not being endowed with the endurance of Athos, who seemed to be made of iron, he would have preferred a bath in the river Seine of which he had heard so much, and afterward his bed; but the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey.
“Come, speak!” said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that they might not be disturbed.
We shall be very unfortunate if, after meeting so often this evening, we should not succeed in meeting to-morrow.”
“And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?”
Morrel bounded to the door, opened it, and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs.
The king, who was entirely surrounded, walked alone in a great empty space.
“‘Woman!—you offend the good God.
“Exactly.”
Edmond found some solace in these ideas.
“I will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,” said Kitty, warmly.
Four men, disguised as workmen, were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich, where a vessel was waiting.”
“Violence,” he said to himself, “would spoil all; D’Artagnan, my friend, prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger, but more subtle than he is.”
There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from Hartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with gray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire, and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius’s rather inaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace—a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch.
Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.
More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches, and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot.
“I can pass.”
Did you come to Noisy to defend him?”
Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair.
“Oh,” cried Madame Danglars, “it was enough to drive you mad!”
“It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France these things are done.
“‘Well,’ said La Carconte, after a moment’s pause, ‘you are not a man.’
It was necessary to reach M. de Tréville; it was important that he should be informed of what was passing.
“Suppose there were a window in this wall.”
“So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living.”
The next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking arm-in-arm on the seashore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had appeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and, finally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.
Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door, which was made of three planks; the door had never been painted or varnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on.
The same ceremony recommenced, with the same words, whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass, that he might disguise himself like the king.
“‘By whom?’
Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it was she.
‘Not at all, I assure you.’
I think he has not been arrested, and as I am his wife’s confessor, if she knows where he is I shall know it too.”
“Whilst supper is being prepared,” he said, smiling, “you will not, my friend, be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up.”
The Duc de Beaufort.
“Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.”
“Well, then, we will put simply, _My Lord, do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared?_”
M. de Tréville, who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased recommending him to the king.
She pointed to each letter of the alphabet.
“And we, too,” added Beauchamp and Château-Renaud.
“Well, such a woman, who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic, would save France.”
Chapter 6.
Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve, raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm, as large as the leg of any ordinary man.
‘Gentlemen,’ said the president, when silence was restored, ‘is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony, treason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this House?’—‘Yes,’ replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice.
“You did?
Help me out of Paris; help me out of France!”
“No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope not.”
“It is your new master, my good fellow,” said the footman.
“By all means,” replied Monte Cristo; “I follow you.”
“What are you going to do?” cried Mme.
You are surprised at what you see here?”
Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I.
“If you yield him dead, all will indeed be at an end, my lord, but quite otherwise than you mean.”
Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen, my horse sprang into the water.
Franz found himself in utter darkness.
Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I took it, and advanced towards the thicket.
Now, then, all is agreed; let us go down.”
“Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,” said Villefort.
“I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but certainly everything appears to me black in this house,” said Debray.
“Then,” said he, “you are ready to pay the official visits, which are absolutely indispensable?”
The crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there.
You have succeeded; the prince is beaten, since he can no longer fight.
“At another time,” added he, “I should have said, Give them, besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed, and the little money that remains to me is not my own, so do not think me mean on this account.”
“Your arms, my lord—what arms?”
“Rest yourself, mother,” he said.
“My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years old, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.”
“Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?”
“I think it charming.”
This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy ground, was of irreproachable odor.
“We should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a boy,” resumed Athos; “and yet it will not be the less said we were four men.”
The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion.
He thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he continued to advance.
His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.
Grimaud, going in advance, followed the course which they were to take in the evening.
“How will this end?” he said.
quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to say.”
“Doctor, every son of woman is born to suffer and to die; I am content to suffer and to await death.”
Athos not only failed to reply, he even changed the subject of conversation.
Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world.
“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
“I could not tell you before others,” said he in a low tone, “the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them.
“Perhaps.”
“And all this—all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman’s voice.
Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of terror.
“Come here, Grimaud,” said Athos.
“Well, speak, if it depends on me.”
Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles?
“Count,” he said, “I swear to you my soul is no longer my own.”
Are you going to leave me?”
Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred.
The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from him.
whom?”
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV.
At the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out:
Supper was to be served at three, and the clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.
On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow.
He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being ready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way.
“I have only just left him.”
At the moment he re-entered, the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening, curious as to what the king was doing.
“This is all very strange,” said M. de Tréville, after meditating a minute; “you mentioned my name, then, aloud?”
_A propos_, monseigneur,” continued Tréville, addressing the cardinal, “Monsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered, is he not?”
“Do you think so?” said Monte Cristo, with interest.
“Upon your honor?”
But Athos was a man of inflexible determination; he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed, when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty.
“I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention,” replied a female voice which made the Musketeer start.
“For you alone.”
“Let us hear what it is, first.”
“And nothing more?
The count stopped on seeing the young man.
His fine eyes, no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly, seemed larger, more liquid than ever.
“Very well,” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Aramis?”
“Never mind that, Maximilian,” said Monte Cristo, smiling.
The two piastres that Luigi received every month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in ear-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins.
“Sir,” replied Raoul, putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count, “I owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me.
‘My dear Dantès,’ said he, ‘swear to perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.’
“How do you know I was praying, sir?” said Milady, in a voice broken by sobs.
“Every one according to his nature, my dear D’Artagnan.
“And I—I swear to you before God, madame,” said D’Artagnan, “that if I am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me, I will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone.”
“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.”
“He is speculating in railways,” said Lord Wilmore, “and as he is an expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.”
“Ay, but,” said Aramis, “that young fellow is decidedly a spy.”
“Anne de Bueil!” cried the monk, standing up and lifting his hands to Heaven.
“A lesson?”
Morrel looked around uneasily.
“Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse.
20333m
Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if you grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my strength.
The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, “Let them be guarded more closely than ever.”
Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words.
“Then, Emmanuel?” said the young girl with hesitation, “it is your opinion that I should obey this invitation?”
“Then what would happen?”
Silence prevailed for an instant, during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.
“I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles, laughing all the while till the tears rolled down.”
the thing is simple enough.
“In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success.”
Make use of it, I pray you, for your pleasure or your business.”
“Oh!” said Aramis, “suppose the master is a Puritan?”
“Yes,” said Porthos, “but there are the equipments.”
Peace with the landlord, in addition to Athos’s old horse, cost six pistoles.
Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was like a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,—“But if he is dead——”
“Yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners.”
Give me the despatch, Raoul.”
“And you are not so any longer?”
Almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a cross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith.
“I address you, because you know, that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere; but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same time.
“Were you there, then?”
The request was needless.
In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him.
“About half-past six.”
“Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?” said Planchet, with his shrewd air.
“To sea, viscount; you know I am a sailor.
“I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,” said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès.
“You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?”
“I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.”

“Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to Malibran and Sontag, such singers as these don’t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others.”
“Why are not my Frenchmen here?” he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment; “they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive, and of their tears when dead.”
“this treasure, which may amount to two...
“Good!”
All noise in the streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful.
“Go there?” murmured Julie.
“Your servants,” said he, “who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story; from them I learned it all.”
“And I,” said Athos, “am returning to Bragelonne.
So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted, and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster.
Oh, great city, it is in thy palpitating bosom that I have found that which I sought; like a patient miner, I have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!
Only think, then, if Mademoiselle Danglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugénie, had been named Mademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!”
He pressed his burning lips to the cheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs; he pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,—the child was dead.
“Well, then, listen, Valentine,” said the count; “I have a favor to ask of you.”
Be good enough to open to me, for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master, one of his friends, is here, and wishes to greet him.”
No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse.
After ten minutes’ labor the wall gave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.
“Ah!
“Alas!” said Milady, “I believe so; the queen is so good!”
Speak, I beg you!”
“I have told you that I believe I know him.”
Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison.”
The young men looked at each other with an expression of fear.
forward!” cried D’Artagnan, in his stentorian voice; “we shall laugh over all this in five minutes.”
“Well, this time, Athos,” said D’Artagnan, “upon my word, you are mad.”
Milady continued:
Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure.
My labor is all in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.”
The man said, in a low voice: “I wish—I wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris.
“Speak out,” answered D’Artagnan.
An hour passed, during which Dantès, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves.
“For what purpose?”
At nine o’clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms.
“Tell me, at least, who you are?”
“‘Yes,’ continued the jeweller; ‘but someone else will not be so easy as I am, or content himself with the same story.
“But for the honor of the king—of the queen.”
“Gentlemen,” said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene, “I know what I am saying, and you know as well as I do what I am about to say—Valentine has been assassinated!”
“And am I not a hundred times better thus?” cried Eugénie, smoothing the scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine appearance; “and do you not think me handsomer so?”
“I am endeavoring,” he thought, “to make this man happy; I look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil I have wrought.
“But,” asked Danglars, in a timid tone, “how did you manage about the other formalities—the contract—the settlement?”
“No.”
D’Artagnan was perhaps about to reply, when a blow, similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox, was heard.
Give me your hand and let us go to the minister; and yet,” she added, “suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle?”
A friend of ten years’ standing could not have done more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.”
Porthos was seduced by a wine-colored doublet and sea-green breeches.
“Well,” said the coadjutor, on seeing him, “you are in disgrace, then, abbé?”
“MY DEAR COUSIN, Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Béthune, the air of which you think is bad for her.
“Rue Férou, two steps from here.”
He descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and he was thrust in.
“Most assuredly,” responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone.
The monster was himself.
“And then,” said Monte Cristo, “this is not all.”
“Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?” asked the count.
“What is it?”
We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men, and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches.”
The duke frowned, the officer felt the point of the poniard, which, having penetrated through his clothes, was close to his heart.
About fifty paces off, another man, also appareled as a cavalier, was talking to a Scotch sentinel, and, though a foreigner, he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire dialect.
“Madame!” exclaimed Athos, “what were you saying just now about growing old?
Athos began to despair.
You received a second fortune, money and tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned to a felon’s life, might live as other men.
Remain, then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue.
It is an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg of you.”
He thought of his wife.
’Tis a matter of conscience with them, as with us.”
With hatred in his eyes, foaming at his mouth, and his fist extended, Mordaunt had advanced one more step, a threatening, terrible step, toward De Winter.
Bonacieux, “since he has told you what he has suffered; but to suffer for him is happiness.”
The plan adopted by D’Artagnan was soon perfected.
The major seated himself, therefore, by the side of Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres.
Chapter LI.
What can he want with me?”
D’Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.
I confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police, for, in Italy, justice is only paid when silent—in France she is paid only when she speaks.
“Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?”
He recognized Mordaunt, who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches.
Those who would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable barrier.
“Certainly it is empty,” replied the procurator’s wife, in real innocence.
And the young girl jumped into the britzka, which was admirably arranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.
“And its aim is?”
D’Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to turn it into money.
Chapter II.
Should the king prove a tyrant, for power begets tyranny, serve, love, respect royalty, that Divine right, that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy, so that we—gentlemen, nevertheless, of rank and condition—are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended.”
Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, “count, will you oblige me with your arm?”
Upon reaching their stalls, they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador.
“They are friends of yours, then?”
“I can do it,” said Porthos.
“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of dried orange-peel?”
After a moment’s silence, the lady inquired:
“And me, too!” said D’Artagnan.
On the landing D’Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he trembled.
“My love for you.
“Charlotte Backson, Comtesse de la Fère, Milady de Winter,” said he, “your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven.
D’Artagnan looked much disconcerted.
His own youth seemed to reappear, bringing with it all those savoury remembrances, which are like perfumes more than thoughts.
However, in an hour I shall know all.
appeared, walking fast.
There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it amid torrents of rain.
Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold.
“I see him very often,” said Danglars, drawing himself up; “he is a particular friend of mine.”
A giant had seized also Aramis’s two wrists, who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp.
“Duke,” said Flamarens, “you forget that to-morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance, projected by the prince, assented to by the queen.
The worthy sergeant had recognized the minister’s secretary and the millionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to Beauchamp.
You have known me long enough,” continued Albert, biting his lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp’s anger was beginning to rise,—“you have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point.”
He dreamed that he was endowed with wings—he wished to fly away.
“Do you think so?” answered D’Artagnan, but little convinced, as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was, and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity.
“Monsieur d’Arminges,” said De Guiche, “remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible.
It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration.
“Are you the first that this hand has stricken?
“They will be paid, if there is no way of getting out of it.”
what ails you?” asked Porthos.
love me too; I will not torment you much, but only on condition that you become a Frondist, my young friend, and a hearty Frondist, too.”
Just then the door opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said:
“Ah, that is my affair.
“Ah, indeed?” said Monte Cristo.
“Well,” said Milady, in a trembling voice, “why do you not enter?
“Oh!” said Athos to himself, “is it indeed possible that I hear what I hear and that I see what I see?
“No, my guardian,” replied Raoul, blushing.
“Make way for us, Planchet,” said D’Artagnan in a whisper to him, “or he will not arrive alive; the lungs are attacked, my friend.”
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger.”
“Yes, perfectly well—intimately even.”
He then returned with the same slow step and said:
“She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she asked permission to travel.”
A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours’ sleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.
Do you hear that, madame?
And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the Continent.”
“Halloo!
Sometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest _gendarme_ of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so slowly keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from all the corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a Musketeer of the company of Tréville, he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four companions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction.
Mazarin leaned out of the window.
What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England, which they thought should have arrested the attention of all Europe.
“Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.”
Athos did not reply; he reflected.
“No, try this hare, which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens.”
They are destined to produce at least ten.
“No, monseigneur.”
Do you know where I shall find him?”
Nevertheless, he never borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his creditor by six o’clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening.
“Yes,” said the physician, “I repeat it; she is still alive, and I am astonished at it.”
Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat.
The sergeant began to laugh.
At the end of the dinner he entered in person.
“Ah!
“Where was she?”
The three windows were still untenanted.
Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and compact enough to bear any weight.
It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet, clinking of pincers and cranching of saws.
D’Artagnan, finding a lantern on the deck, took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain, in English, “Come,” (being, with the classic English oath, the only English words he knew), and so saying he descended to the lower deck.
The prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night, each accompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating, before which were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals.
“But,” said Danglars thoughtfully, “how is it that your patron, M. de Monte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?”
It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him.
The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.
I have been here since the morning.
“You here at this hour?” said she.
“So I was going away, but he called me back.
“I should like another sort of oath better,” said D’Artagnan to himself; then aloud, “May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen?”
“But does Maximilian go to Rome?” exclaimed Emmanuel.
The king, even while obeying him like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen.
At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio.
He then saw the great aqueducts, those stone phantoms which he had before remarked, only then they were on the right hand, now they were on the left.
As for me,” he added, with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man, “when I have completed my affairs in Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.”
Her forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward and raised her.
“No.”
what a beautiful creature!” cried Valentine; “why did you not bring him close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?”
Athos would have died rather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask assistance.
“Then is it not,” resumed the duke, “the Superintendent Emery, who gave his son, when he was married, three hundred thousand francs and a house, compared to which the Tuileries are a heap of ruins and the Louvre a paltry building?”
“If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,” said d’Avrigny, looking around him, “perhaps I might prevent suffocation.
“Then you came here to defend him?”
“What do you mean?
Nothing!”
They had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the right, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans.
Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years.
M. de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal’s fat face.
He approached her.
D’Artagnan, however, gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take, and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey.
Thus Dantès, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth.
“This poor child would be better in bed.
The Scotch army stood motionless and silent, seized with shame at sight of these preparations.
Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers.
I name only the most important.”
Felton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken.
In the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry, re-ascended to his wife’s chamber, and found D’Artagnan just recovering his senses.
“Have you not saved Peppino’s life?”
“Faith, Franz,” whispered Albert, “there is not much to find fault with here.”
VOLUME ONE Chapter 1.
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “that woman became criminal only from associating with me!
There was no occasion to push the door, it was wide open.
“Yes, but beer?” asked Blaisois sharply, “is that their true drink?”
“No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely woman.”
“A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.”
“You have one second to decide,” said he.
“I will see them both,” returned the inspector; “I must conscientiously perform my duty.”
It is twenty years since I saw them, and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of them.”
“There,” said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; “give that to Milady.
You have a park, and horses, servants.”
“Yes.”
“Then I would kill him rather than let him go.”
And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian followed him, trembling as he went.
“A thousand francs, sir.”
The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed.
I hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to you.”
“The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third-rate house to despair.”
The one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.
“Whither are you taking me?” asked he.
“I am brave.”
I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that you are more sober than he was.”
Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity.
I examined the thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty.
“Then, addressing the man who accompanied him, ‘Executioner,’ said he, ‘do your duty.’”
“Stop, let me show you the way.”
“How do I know it?”
There are certain forms necessary to be gone through, and which are always the same.
I retreated with the rest, for eight-and-forty hours.
You had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death.”
“You wish to know what I will do?”
Come, let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly.”
“‘Yes, I know that,’ he said, ‘but give me the particulars.’
This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.
The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed, and declared that he was dead.
“Well!” said D’Artagnan.
“Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.”
“What fortune has she?”
D’Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the door of his friend’s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni.
“You are deceived, madame,” said Felton, blushing; “Lord de Winter is not capable of such a crime.”
“No; I make you my lieutenant-general,” said the king.
Dead Animosities.
“Give him the despatch, Raoul!
“Then,” cried Planchet joyously, “I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we seek.
“There or elsewhere.”
It is that we are each of us twenty years older; it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest, whispers of ambition, counsels of selfishness.
“If it was not you, it was your purveyor,” said D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge.
D’Artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense.
“Ah, you gentlemen of policy!” replied the cardinal, knitting his brow in his turn, “the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming.”
You are a faithful friend, Felton.”
She was looking at the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky.
“Very good, signor Pastrini,” said Franz; “but we must have some supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days.”

“Revels in it.”
He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them, and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton, who, naively, and like the worthy steward that he was, handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself.
“Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,” said M. de Villefort.
In Crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring.
Adieu, madame.”
“And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?”
He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in the ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the latter, like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep, “Monsieur d’Artagnan!”
“Follow you!” cried Bonacieux, “follow you at this hour!
For my part, I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them, in spite of all the Mazarins in the world.”
“Where can we find another sword?” asked Porthos.
“I will not detain you, monsieur,” continued the countess; “I would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate.”
Imitate me.
“No, no, read,” exclaimed the queen, indignantly; “read, I command you, for I am resolved that everything shall be finished to-night and never will I recur to this subject again.
“Yes; you see I am as exact as you are.
The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier, so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive.
You resist, do you?” cried Jussac.
Stand here, don’t stir, turn your back to the road and wait for me.”
“Willingly, monseigneur,” said the executioner; “for as I am a good Catholic, I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman.”
“Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.”
He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up everything—kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himself—at the first signal given by my father.
D’Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not wanting in probability.
“He is and he is not,” replied Athos; “that is to say, he is dismissed by one-half of France, but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him; you will perceive that this may last a long time.”
forward!”
Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight.
At the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and Mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the particular inspection.
“Here, sire?”
“Then we must fly!” said he.
“Ah,” said Caderousse, “you would not like me to risk taking cold?”
Then, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed her features, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most seducing smile.
“And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?”
“I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago,” he said, “and you find me still in affliction on that account.
In the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then turning toward D’Artagnan, stood quite astonished.
“Ah, my friend!” cried Porthos, “like the crows, you always bring bad omens.
“Do you know, Signor Pastrini,” said Albert, lighting a second cigar at the first, “that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.”
“How old?”
Good God!” asked the poor woman, “have I said anything that has wounded you?”
You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage.
“You!” he said, “you!
“M.
“For a thousand pistoles,” said the captain.
If it is written yonder, in Heaven, that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape, he will escape; and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it.”
And so—being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the comic operas say, and rich—and that is happiness, sir—why do you call me unhappy?”
“I have brought my receipt.”
“Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave you, you would now be dead.
One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge near, and by its light they examined the weapons.
Porthos made a sign of assent.
I do not ask you for liberty, as a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a pagan.
“What, ho!” said Grimaud.
When he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it.”
“Oh, my God!
The juncture was favorable.
But the queen pressed the child’s hand.
The young man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.
“In private?” asked Morrel.
“And Aramis; I see you have not forgotten the name.”
Now take me aboard and return to your post, for they will soon be here.”
You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for thirty-five francs.”
When you return I will set the fuse myself, but be careful to conceal your face, so that you cannot be recognized by them.”
“Stop,” said D’Artagnan; “we are near Athos’s door.
At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act.
He arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched,—“Say, Mercédès,” he said, “once for all, is this your final determination?”
At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade.
“Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having no suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off.
“Ah, bah!” said D’Artagnan; “you have at some wicket of the Louvre a _concierge_ who is devoted to you, and who, thanks to a password, would—”
Fight on all occasions.
As a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches toward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique priestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her throat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan, and went toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her melodious voice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy:
why so?”
“No, take it away; I can see in the dark.”
Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds.
“Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.”
“Yes, for time presses.”
He came to request his master to return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously said.
And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell out at the market price.
This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it, and here it is.”
Slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew his opinion on the subject.
“Do so.”
“Very good,” said the count.
He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark.
“Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of you.
my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal!
As he passed the Hôtel des Gardes, he took a glance into the stables.
“I am ready,” said Maximilian; “I came expressly to wish them farewell.”

“It is well.
This poor fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him.’
Friquet, who did not expect to be let off so cheaply, bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine, and disappeared.
“‘_Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the Rue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815_.’”
“The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?”
_Peste!_ That’s a fine age!” replied Porthos.
Laporte went out; the queen remained standing near the hangings, whilst D’Artagnan glided behind the curtains.
“Quite a vineyard, hey?”
D’Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy.
To-day it’s a sort of diplomatic arrangement; ask Planchet.”
“To arms!” cried Grimaud.
“If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt, or at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence.
I confess, if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince, and if my brother De Turenne were reinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might.”
“Oh, this is too much!”
I have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I don’t know what village, with I don’t know what curé, of whom she asked hospitality and who, having but one chamber, and taking her for a cavalier, offered to share it with her.
“But can you find your man?” said Aramis to Athos.
“And now, Monsieur du Verger,” he said, “shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door.
One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio.
Then, if he persists, notwithstanding all this—as that is, as I have said, the limit of my mission—I shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France.
“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes.”

“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII.
And the steward followed the notary out of the room.
’tis you, La Ramee; in faith, ’tis time you came back again.
A few minutes later they were on board, but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men, and it was eight o’clock before they raised anchor.
A man wrapped in a cloak, in the folds of which his face was hidden, approached and leaned over the bed and looked.
“Who rang?” asked Valentine.
“Be satisfied; I will deny it.”
“Their officers wish to see you, sir.”
Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter was to learn his father’s name.

“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.

“We will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but likewise, upon our word as gentlemen,” added Athos, knitting his brow, “Monsieur d’Artagnan shall not leave us.”
“Oh, sire, what an idea!

“Here is the brazier, lighted.”
stop!” and the sergeant, who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice, was almost in a frenzy of despair.
Bring six of them.”
It is impossible to say whether Charles, who kept his eyes constantly closed, had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain, but the moment he heard the clear tone of D’Artagnan’s voice his eyelids rose, in spite of himself.
“Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on.”
Will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence?
“My prince!” interrupted D’Artagnan.
“You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these 3,000 francs?” said Mercédès, coloring.
“I!” said Caderousse, astonished; “who told you I was there?”
But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had forgotten that.
“Well, what does your instinct tell you now?”
Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard:
“And who is it?” said Porthos.
You shall take him with you there.
Bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or Belgium.
“You may depend on my doing so, sir,” said Baptistin.
“Dear me!” said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband’s inmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of Villefort; “what is the matter?”
They continued their route.
Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who have surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some desert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest.”
The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.
By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it.”
Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time, but by this time Pistache’s patience was exhausted; he threw himself furiously upon the cane, wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth.
Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette, where pretty Madeleine, the hostess, came to him.
This was a sort of boudoir, circular, and lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.

“Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?”
“You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?” asked Valentine.
Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:—
The glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms stretched out before him.
“Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another.
“Well, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry.”
Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword.
“How?
His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples.
Are you going to rejoin your cardinal?
Barrois took away the waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his haste he forgot to shut, than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled.
And he wrote to D’Artagnan to hasten his return.
From time to time, by the light of the moon, which began to rise, Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Peppino.
A terrible inclination seized D’Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent youth, and he restrained himself.
“Ho!
“Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents.
Some were perusing the article, others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more.
Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville, but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor, guarding Mazarin carefully.
“All that could be required of me.
“And where is the messenger?”
yes.”
The first fear of the King of England, Charles I., on learning of the death of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_, to conceal it from them as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom, and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in default of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.
“I see,” returned the Englishman, “that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to serve you.”
“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject.

“It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything.
Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan.
The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that D’Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence.
But, alas, I have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; I trust we shall never find it so in our experience!”
The host stood at the door.
“No; I have heard Porthos speak of her, that’s all.”
Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground, as if he were looking for a crown-piece in the dust.
“Battle!” cried Porthos.
Well, this man.
“And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?”
Pray tell me how.”
“Well, perhaps you are right,” said Athos.
“Well?
He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband.
Chapter LXXX.
“To embark with you.”
The general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed, looked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to support him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door, through which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful, lamentable, distressing cry:
Since that period of history queens have shed tears, like other women.
“Well, my lord,” said La Ramee, with his rude laugh, “you still set yourself against this poor fellow?”
A pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him with anxiety.
“At them!” cried Raoul.
On entering his hôtel, M. de Tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint.
How had he discovered her arrival, and caused her to be seized?
Do you think it is worth while?” said Villefort.
“All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already made.”
“Is yours.”
“Where are these papers, then?”
“What do you think a spy would be about here?
The queen!
During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier.
You need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this.”
As to Groslow, he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from D’Artagnan what he had lost to Porthos, and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment.
“But listen to me, then,” resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience.
“Yes, excellency,” returned the steward; “but it was very late.”
“And alone?”
“She goes into England,” said Athos.
In the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect, no doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable.
“What horses?” asked Athos.
“Ah!” said the king, “I was unjust; here is a creature that loves me.
“More reason, then, he should protect a king pursued by parliament.”
“Is it Mazarin’s proximity that makes you so prudent?”
At the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.
Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him.
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated.”
This time Maximilian was the first to arrive.
Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites.
“From France!” cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came.
“’Tis a last resource, but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for; let us rather persevere in our researches.”
In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best.
So long as you are not mine, Valentine, I shall always think I may lose you.”
Bernouin entered.
However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him.
[22] Literally, “the basket,” because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle.
The same order was followed in returning, nor did Grimaud’s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance, save a dark shadow, as it were, in ambuscade, at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Quai.
Athos smiled.
“Felton has not told him,” said Milady to herself.
M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes, notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze.
Chapter I.
I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead.”
“Do you remember, sir it was my idea, the Scotch treaty, for giving up the king?”
“What have you come for, then?”
Twenty guards, well mounted, are all that I shall need for my escort.”
Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began.
“And does the husband of this frightful creature still live?” said Aramis.
But with the rapidity of thought D’Artagnan seized Athos by the waist, and followed by Porthos with Aramis, leaped down from the benches, rushed into the passages, and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without, while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators, whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed.
And yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady.
“What, no wine?
Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an hour after Julie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went stealthily along the passage, to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing.
“To horse!” re-echoed Athos; “everything is arranged and decided.”
“Oh!” said Oliver, with a slight curl of his lip, “I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid.”
“Well, friend!
“Have you no friends in Paris, then, Monsieur Porthos?” said the procurator’s wife.
“Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.”
Then, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, “Drink.
Albert pretended he did not hear, bowed to his mother, and quitted her.
Dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del’ Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade.
The public astonishment had reached its height.
Gondy, edged into a corner, saw them vanish from the first until the last but one.
And this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young D’Artagnan—for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante named—from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was.
He wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat.
do not go away!” exclaimed D’Artagnan, impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature, the native brightness of his character; “I swear that I would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you, Athos—of such a man as you, Aramis.” And he threw himself into the arms of Athos.
“We will not answer, then; we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence.”
Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him.
One of the bandits rose, and offered him a glass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s cry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came.
“Yes; I have parted with him.”
The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous, and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling.
Then he took away his mother’s portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty.
“Bravo!” said Athos; “that does honor to your imagination.”
“I hope that is true,” said Aramis.
“‘M.
Everyone must live.”
After remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house, and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench; then from the bench she went to the gate.
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it.
We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health, D’Artagnan.”
The decanter and the glass were completely empty.
“Welcome home again.”
“It is possible, Haydée, that so perfect a seclusion, though conformable with the habits and customs of the East, may not be practicable in Paris.
“No, it is the name of the island he has purchased.”
“Ah!
“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant—that’s all.
“I will tell you all,” said Valentine; “from you I have nothing to conceal.
“What reason?” asked D’Artagnan.
At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop.
I can’t leave you alone in this abominable country.”
He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil—the terror of all expert palates.
“Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had nothing to ask of him.”
Fine vengeance that, on my faith!”
He entered, and on his way met the waiter.
But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon, which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance, but in what way he knew not.
Athos extended his arm toward him, pointing him out to his companions.
“Save me!
He repaired, therefore, immediately to his hôtel, and caused himself to be announced.
No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it.
“Show it to the abbess, and tell her that someone will come and fetch me, either today or tomorrow, and that I am to follow the person who presents himself in your name.”
It seemed to all three that they knew him.
“Capital; but how will you get me out of Paris?”
The Breakfast Chapter 41.
The same day he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred; and a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.
Tell me, I entreat.”
They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.”
Section 1.
“Faith, yes,” replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling.
The other room near the library was a bedroom.
“Is that Monte Cristo?” asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted, in a melancholy voice.
“What do you mean, Grimaud?” he exclaimed.
Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother, because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse.
“‘What,’ cried I, ‘do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?’
At that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as Tréville.
“Tomorrow, my dear friend,” said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man’s madness.
I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower, or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept!
These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless possessing their point of union.
The chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing.
“Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like order in everything.”
“He is a very strange man,” she said, “and in my opinion is himself the Adelmonte he talks about.”
By degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth, so pure, so fresh.
“And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?”
He then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits—for the Abbé Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit.
“My dear M. Cavalcanti,” said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner, “how much are you paid for being my father?”
“To seek me?” repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.
But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the convent.
“What happened during the night?” asked Beauchamp of Château-Renaud; “we appear to make a very sorry figure here.”
“I answer for Bazin,” said Aramis.
For a time these wings supported him, but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him.
Then he advanced to the door, and asked whether there were any rooms to be let.
Withdraw him gently from the queen, whom he does not like, from Mazarin, whom he despises.
“Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that rope.”
“_‘Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani, alla sette il conte Alberto avrà cessato di vivere.
If the king was still irritated against them, they would depart without being seen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be called.
Cannot I serve you as a waiting maid?
Some days before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted.
Those were the count’s windows.”
another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt.
“Sir,” said the cardinal, “you have heard me?
Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words: ‘God is great!’ However, my mother had still some hope.
“And here are the other five hundred,” replied Milady, placing her hand upon the bag of gold.
Grimaud alone was calm as ever.
Meanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase, which, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort even would not have alarmed him.
“It is but fair,” said Porthos and Aramis, hoping he would choose one of them.
The man took his way toward the city.
“You say she is in a convent?” replied Porthos.
“Then give me water,” cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.
The vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water.
Tell me, then!
“Upon my word that is true,” said Porthos; “but how can you suppose, my dear friend, that in the midst of his great preoccupations General Cromwell has had time to think——”
“_Parbleu!_ Indeed I do,” said Athos; “I not only approve of what he has done, but I congratulate him upon it.”
We have nothing to fear from those who love us.”
“Speak, monsieur.”
’Twas the first time D’Artagnan had ever refused a request from Athos.
What could he say?
But Monte Cristo, without rising, and leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking the damp, crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man:
“What a brute of a host!
Felton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.
“Sir,” said Albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually became firmer, “I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M. de Morcerf in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had no right to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that right.
You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon, I hope, have news that will be agreeable to you.”
if we had been in their place!”
“Yes; there is peril of imprisonment, risk of life in knowing me.”
And you—what will you become?
“Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.”
“‘What is your name?’ inquired the traveller.
Let me embrace him, I am in a hurry to see him again.”
“What are the two fish?” asked Danglars.
I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me.
“And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?”
“Aw?” said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives of Great Britain.
The prisoner did not wish to lose time; and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon, by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed.
“I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to parting.
“With the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits of Amiens.”
You have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels, always followed by such happy results.”
“I cannot believe it,” murmured the banker.
“If only they close the guardhouse door!
Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.
Is he prosperous and happy?”
The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke, a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal, who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of Austria.
He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend, or perhaps because of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and over whom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as Fiesco17 had done over the Moor who would have killed him.
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed lightning.
D’Artagnan determined not to question this man; he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planchet.
“No; but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it, so never mind.”
“I had three similar ones,” returned Monte Cristo.
“Your majesty’s mind may be quite at ease,” replied the officer; “I have my answer ready.”
The two men in black, who guessed D’Artagnan’s meaning, darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening; but D’Artagnan took no heed of it.
He, having seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they rang in vain.
M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
In fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion.
I thought I had crushed you, madame; but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you!”
Four marble steps led down to the water’s edge, and below them was a boat floating on the tide.
“Oh, the magnificent hair!” said Louise, with regret.
Parisians and Frondeurs as they were, the two friends expected to find the same misery, the same fears, the same intrigue in the enemy’s camp; but what was their surprise, after passing Saint Denis, to hear that at Saint Germain people were singing and laughing, and leading generally cheerful lives.
“You are free,” he said, “through me; your liberty was my ransom.”
“Till tomorrow, rash youth,” said the Jesuit.
“Bah!
And after this reasoning she slept easily.
I know a man who will find the means of taking me from Paris, a man I have too long forgotten.” Then falling into a reverie, she added, however, with an expression of joy, “Ungrateful woman that I am, for twenty years I have forgotten this man, whom I ought to have made a marechal of France.
“No, my child, no,” said Madame de Saint-Méran; “but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.”
Porthos told him of it in his calm manner.
“Five or six millions, is it not?”
He was rather above the middle height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light hair, turning rather gray.
They found the door ajar.
“Luigi Vampa himself searched.”
At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_, a priest arrived in some haste, forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the brotherhood, gave him a folded paper.
“I shall rely on it.
But I am not surprised; the spring has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir.
40114m
I received a letter from him, the dear fellow, in which he even asked me for some small service, which, in fact, I rendered him.
“Then,” said Villefort, “nothing further is required.
The sea continued to get calmer.
“But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse?”
“Sire,” he said, in a low voice, “do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise?”
“Yes, I own it.”
With the deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence.
“Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia?
Morrel took leave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o’clock, and to bring Emmanuel.
“His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my having myself saved him from death.”
Then, when he raised it again, he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air.
Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee.
“He did get out, nevertheless.”
Well, everything was finished as you know.
Franz stopped.
“My husband has given me his word, sir,” said Madame de Villefort; “you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain.”
It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached.
“That’s well.
“You know he is almost dumb.”
“Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.
If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti’s fortune, that might be pardoned.
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man who listened to her, Milady continued her recital.
A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them; they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.
“Marry her then,” said the count, with a significant shrug of the shoulders.
The escort divided into two files.
“Aha!” said Groslow; “what king?”
“1829, your excellency.”
“Good heavens!” said Aramis to Athos, “does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante-chamber?”
The young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands.
It could be seen that she had wished to speak, but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion’s words.
“But how, my God?”
First Volume of the D’Artagnan Series
We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires.
On perceiving Monte Cristo, she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself, expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love.
What the devil did you come to such a country for, Athos?
Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots!
“He who wounded Jussac!” cried the king, “he, a boy!
“Oh, pardon me, pardon me!” he murmured; “if not in the name of God, at least in your own name; if not as priest, then as son.”
“Bring me a _carafe_ of water,” said the abbé.
“Changing our clothes!” exclaimed Porthos.
Tomorrow morning.”
“Why?—what do you mean by that question?”
Mercédès shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, “You speak strangely,” said she to Albert, “and you appear to have some singular prejudices.
“Well,” said Beauchamp.
Albert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then again with shame, for from Beauchamp’s confidence he knew his father was guilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could prove his innocence.
The sitting commences at two; it is now three, and I am to speak.”
No, no, you do yourselves injustice; but I am here to do you justice.
“My master, my good master!”
“From Haydée.”
“Perfect, madame, as you have seen,” replied the count; “and I frequently make use of it—with all possible prudence though, be it observed,” he added with a smile of intelligence.
“Yes.” Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier’s room.
“It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging—qui frondent—stones from the moats round Paris, young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears, only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned.
Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache.
He called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
“I am as certain of it as that we two are Christians.”

“Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de Morcerf.”
“Be satisfied,” replied Bonacieux; “my wife adores me, and there is yet time.”
Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it.
Pray let me know who you really are?”
I therefore may hesitate between you.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the _valet-de-chambre_.
“Shall I give you a line for the vicar of St. Jacques de la Boucherie?
“But she saw no one?”
I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you, but I shall lodge here no longer.
“The third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?”
“A horse for your lackey?” resumed the procurator’s wife, hesitatingly; “but that is doing things in lordly style, my friend.”
“We are about to ascertain, sire,” replied D’Artagnan, as he rapidly left the room.
de Villefort,” he said, “will you conduct the Baroness Danglars?”
She stopped in the doorway, listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp, the only sound in that deserted room, and then advanced to the table to see if Valentine’s glass were empty.
But, though he held the cardinal’s promises as of little worth, he affected to be completely satisfied, for he was unwilling to discourage Porthos.
“The middle one?”
“The queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is a devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife.
The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion.
However,” continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, “I have an infallible remedy.”
“I do not recollect it,” said Haydée.
“From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence?”
Mme.
What prevents you from being so?”
Besides, what was Morcerf seeking?
Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself.
“Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?”
“No, vicomte,” said Madame de Chevreuse, taking his hand and making him sit near her, while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure; “no, unhappily, I am not the queen.
Bonacieux, “we shall hear no more.”
“What did he say?” asked Porthos.
D’Artagnan then looked around attentively.
The more they are persecuted, the more she thinks of them; and often, when they least expect it, they have proof of a kind remembrance.”
“I think I have sprained my wrist,’ said Porthos.
I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken, but which, for better or worse, had been patched with plaster and with black silk.
“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”
The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.
Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?
Athos remained a Musketeer under the command of D’Artagnan till the year 1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he also quit the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small property in Roussillon.
You have committed the first wrong, since it was you who suspected the queen.”
All the world was occupied with the ceremony, so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed.
Give me a simple assignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash, and I will hand you over the money.”
“The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,” said the host.
“But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle?”
Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed:
“’Tis well,” said D’Artagnan, holding out his hand to receive the money.
“Your Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night at the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the letter of Madame de Chevreuse.”
“Fortunately,” said D’Artagnan, “all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I hope, only men to dread.”
“I am, sir,” said the king, much agitated; “and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Benedetto, you are fallen into terrible hands; they are ready to open for you—make use of them.
It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us both good.”
you have purchased it dearly enough.”
He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur’s footstep was heard in the passage.
But how did this horse come into your hands, Mousqueton?”
Oh, it was cruel to us, and—dare I say it?—to you also.”
“Well, what are you doing, count—to a former lackey?
“Thanks for the comparison,” said Albert, with a bow.
“I’faith, colonel,” said D’Artagnan, “we are very grateful for your gracious invitation; for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner, as we have without breakfast.
Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of St. Gervais, and do not bow too low to this Italian; that might give him a poor idea of you.”
They search her; she resists; they use force—the scoundrels!”
I have pursued it for six years only.”
But you, my dear D’Artagnan, what has happened to you?”
“But of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, Monsieur Porthos?”
“‘Now,’ said the old man, ‘aid me to bury my child.’ Carlini fetched two pickaxes; and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak, beneath which the young girl was to repose.
“What is it?”
Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw, fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.
This doublet and hose, though new, were creased, like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau.
Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles’ belief; the last month’s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same evening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, threw them into an almost empty drawer, saying:
“Yes,” said Dantès; “do you know him?”
“Ah!
“But how?
“As if they had been one man—as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast.”
The latter, his heart palpitating more than ever, entered the courtyard without dismounting.
Monte Cristo smiled significantly.
“Nay,” answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, “’tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded.

To see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty—it was too much for a visionary; it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns, by the hatred of men that devours.
“‘Julie,’ said he to her, ‘Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains.

“Your quarrels with the parliament, your noisy dissensions with the princes, who fight for you to-day and to-morrow will fight against you, the popular following directed by the coadjutor, President Blancmesnil, and Councillor Broussel—all that disorder, in short, which pervades the several departments of the state, must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war; for in that event England, exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas, will ally herself with Spain, already seeking that alliance.

D’Artagnan, pressing his hand, repeated his call.
The guards were under arms, and D’Artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades.

She is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!”
“Aramis,” said Athos, “are you jesting?”
“Goeden day, broder,” replied the astonished landlady.
“Liar!” thought D’Artagnan.
Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which D’Artagnan, in raising the shutters, had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window.
The change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory.

“Neither can we procure horses?”
Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps.
“Yes.”
“Oh!
“Why, I am ready to tell everything,” cried Bonacieux, “at least, all that I know.
“I believe so,” said the major.
Caderousse sighed.

Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette.”

The superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal’s order.
?”
“Come in, my dear John,” said Lord de Winter, “come in, and shut the door.”
Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel.
All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety.
“He has at least found peace.”
“It was at night.
“That paper must be torn to pieces,” said D’Artagnan, who fancied he read in it his sentence of death.
“You have not forgotten St. Gervais, Athos, and the napkin which was converted into a banner?” and he then related to Raoul the story of the bastion, and Raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry, so gloriously recounted by Tasso and Ariosto.
“My son,” said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure Béarn _patois_ of which Henry IV.

“I will tell you,” replied the young girl, “for it is but right you should know.
“Ah!
“De Wardes; I know it,” cried D’Artagnan.
These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt.
Happy—beyond measure!”
“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded.
The whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two women had entered Madame de Villefort’s service,—in fact, everywhere, to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family.
She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to M. Noirtier’s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found the old servant.

He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.
“With your permission,” said Danglars, bowing, “I will precede you, to show you the way.”
“Very well,” said he.
“Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell plays in England?”
Athos surmised what had taken place and smiled.
Grimaud smiled.
“But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you appear to recollect so well,” replied Eugénie, “I saw you arranging a deposit—is not that the term?—of five millions and a half; you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning.”
“The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water.
In this garden Mercédès had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum of money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously.
“From my father?”
Villefort, suffocating, pressed the doctor’s arm.
Athos smiled and D’Artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover; but to all these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm, sweet smile and Aramis by nodding his head.
All at once, in a narrow pass, they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone.
“I remember well,” said Planchet, “he was fond of drinking—in truth, he drank, but not as other men drink.

“I thought I did not mistake.
But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything?”
It is eleven o’clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of King Charles I.
“Albert is ten minutes after time.”
Bazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of this change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.
“Mouston,” said Porthos, “saddle Vulcan and Bayard.”
Charles was impatiently awaiting his return.
“Yes, but you understand French,” and Mazarin laid his hand upon Guitant’s shoulder.
“Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,—there has been such a drought.”
“And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you, and to endeavor to kill you.”

Through the gate was seen kitchen-gardens, carefully attended to, a spacious courtyard, in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries, and a carriage, drawn by two horses of the country.
Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband’s arm, maintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor widow.

Paris is a horrible place in summer.
Montrose, beaten at Philiphaugh, was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly, disguised as a servant.
The door was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.
“And who was the winner?”
Upon gaining this advantage D’Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor, it was a woman!
Four large vessels, recently built, had just been launched.
“It is late, and the governor is asleep.
Courtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another, day and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which the cardinal had established his residence.
But what detains her?
Hold!
“You see!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Yes,” said Athos.
Then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy:
“My friend,” said Andrea, “I have been dining at Saint-Jean-aux-Bois, and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a fool I have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest.
Mazarin started.
“But you will remain; you are not afraid?” said D’Artagnan, coming back to recommend courage to his lackey.
Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary Tantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he would not break it.
The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished.
“Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.”
“Mademoiselle,” said Eugénie, “let the porter get the post-chaise from the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel.

Three months since it was M. de Saint-Méran; Madame de Saint-Méran two months since; the other day it was Barrois; today, the old Noirtier, or young Valentine.”
Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard.
“Ah, really,” said Monte Cristo.
He perceived his mistake; but the friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of them addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness.
“In any case,” said the duke, “his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavigny.”

This noise redoubled when D’Artagnan, with a company of musketeers, placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the church.
“I have my plan.
“Ah,” cried Albert, “it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me; you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?”
I will bless you—I——”
Edmond resigned the lugger to the master’s care, and went and lay down in his hammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a moment.
“And now, Raoul,” said the Gascon, “Monsieur du Vallon and I are going away as ambassadors, where, I know not; but should you want anything, write to Madame Turquaine, at La Chevrette, Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker—with economy; for it is not so well filled as that of Monsieur d’Emery.”
“I did not venture to ask, sir; he spoke elegantly, although I thought from his accent he was an Englishman.”
Besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece, and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture.
Then, with renewed instructions to Grimaud, Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out, and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment.
Morrel, evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry.
The hangings were of damask, the carpets from Alencon, and the bed, especially, had more the look of a fine lady’s couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane, than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification.
“What game shall I find there!”
The poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.
Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.
Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion.”
The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
“To me?—no—was there one?”
Come, we have not any time to lose, it is half-past twelve—let us set off.”

The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his sword under his arm, stood in the doorway.
“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month?”
“When you dine there, do you sleep there?”
“No, sir, I am alone in the world.”
D’Artagnan knew what she wanted.
“The scheme goes forward, it seems.”
“Indeed,” said Julie, “might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that those people, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius—like the wicked fairies in Perrault’s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism—hovered over them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect?”

And the man opposite to you is——
Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, “my heart beats so I cannot walk.”
“So much the worse; I had much rather you were French and myself also; they would hate us both less.”
“Yes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn—a chamber that I could have let ten times over.”
Am I, or am I not, the queen?

“The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,” said Danglars.

You offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.’
“Madame,” said D’Artagnan, rising, “I have only one thing more to wish, which is, that the next thing you ask from me, shall be—my life.”
The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail.
“You came to inquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well.
Ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; Valentine, who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly, incapable of controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images.
He stood badly with the Liberal papers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists.
“Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind.
My lord,” added Henrietta, with a melancholy smile, “it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the Louvre without money, without linen, almost without bread, and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire.”
“How much did it cost you?”
“Base coward!
Now, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals, factions, and government intrigues.
“Order it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.”
M. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk.
“Yes, Giulio,” she said, “proud and happy; for I have found the means of strangling this hydra.”
Passing alongside one of them, D’Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung—the same whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom D’Artagnan had thought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her.
“Excellency,” said Pastrini, “I am delighted to have your approbation, but it was not for that I came.”
“So much the better,” said Porthos; “I feel some need of it.”
But these 200 francs?”
And by whom were they recommended to you?”
Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”
“It was he, sire, it was he!”

Let us set off.”
“And so our division is made, mother,” said the young man, affecting ease of mind.
I make the first advances?” said the king.
“Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.”
Mousqueton collected a store of crusts; Bazin, who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches; Planchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master, heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.
This picturesque attire set him off to great advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and when his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations.
Yes, and I would rather face your majesty, however threatening your smile, than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence, unless from deepest hell.”
“What, you scoundrel!
“Meantime, here we are, enemies!” said Porthos.
“Oh, no,” said Villefort; “I never ceased to search and to inquire.
“A good journey, gentlemen!
“Yes.”
“All you have in gold.”
“Do you not see?” returned the count, “that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him?
It is I who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which have caused it to be decided against me.”
Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his toilet, drove to the Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo.
When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers: ‘Comrades,’ he said, ‘you are about to suffer a furious discharge; but after that you will make short work with those fellows.’ There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words; then raising his sword, ‘Sound trumpets!’ he cried.”
“Ah, pardieu!” he exclaimed; “that would be fair play.”
At the Place Louis XV.
When she recovered, her father was by her side.
As to D’Artagnan, he remained standing like a man in consternation, with the deepest affliction depicted on his face.
“Oh,” said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone,—“oh, be satisfied, I can understand my father.” While uttering these words with this expression of joy, his teeth clashed together violently.
The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son.
“Well,” said the young woman, “what you dreaded has happened.
“My dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men!”
“If there is a third shot,” said he to himself, “I am a lost man.”
He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and, tired of waiting, he must have gone on.”
“He has invited me to dine there.”
“D’Artagnan!” said Athos, reproachfully.
The lackeys followed.
“Who said Valentine was dead?”
“I charmed it away.”
She had still her nymph-like form, so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped, with Anne of Austria, over the moat of the Tuileries in 1563.
I said nothing, for we must have peace in the house; and 100,000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much.
He therefore told him all.
It was evident, from her figure and the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious in her tastes, but that was all.
She is a foreigner—a stranger.
That’s well.
Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry.
“Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.”
And very soon they left the inn.
This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease.
“You do not understand?” asked Felton.
“Exactly so.”
“Not at all,” said D’Artagnan; “should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute, all would be lost.”
Charles shook his head.
“It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,” said the doctor.
“I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse.
“They belong to the regiment that was at Lens, which the prince assigned to the cardinal.”
“That’s well.”
Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness.
you confess it!” exclaimed Mazarin.
Albert left the cab in which he had come at the count’s door, intending to take a turn on foot.
His horse bounded to one side, losing its footing, and fell, entangling Raoul’s leg under its body.
But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will require a negotiator; that negotiator will be me.

Peppino remained breathless.
“To get away you would not mind, you added, knocking down a door or a wall.”
“The town is in open revolt, and just now, as I was crossing the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon, who is here, and is your humble servant, they wanted in spite of my uniform, or perhaps because of my uniform, to make us cry ‘Long live Broussel!’ and must I tell you, my lord what they wished us to cry as well?”
Ali, mute and attentive, brought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared.
Answer!”
“You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.”
“You see,” said Raoul, “we have done wisely.”
We shall both get into trouble.
You don’t imagine he would consider a little thing like that?”
“What?
He has been travelling with a very severe tutor, and had never been to Paris before.”
“Our passport?”
“Repeat your father’s name,” said the president.
There was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused.
“My lord, either with the officers of the guard, with the other prisoners, or with me.”
The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about thirty or two-and-thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen trousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles.
I regret that I ever crossed swords with you, Porthos; I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast, but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment; now, Athos, come.”
“Bravo,” said Beauchamp to Albert; “I shall not go to the Chamber, but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M. Danglars.”
Had you known this Edmond Dantès, of whom they spoke?”
“Monsieur, the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me,” he said.
“Then you have some other motive unknown to us?”
“Sire,” replied Villefort, bowing, “in an hour I shall have quitted Paris.”
“I have another,” replied Maximilian; “but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first.”
The assassin, finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by the hair; his eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted.

VOLUME THREE
What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”
The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door, the stranger bowed and took his leave, and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M. de Villefort.
“You particularly wish it?” asked he.
“The count!
It is understood, of course, that when we say “the queen,” Mazarin is meant.
When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips.
“The moment is at hand,” he said.
“I will leave you the torch, sir.”

“Wait, then, wait.”
“His house?
You succeeded, and then God snatched it from you, and brought you to justice.”
Besides, remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye.”
He removed his seat into a corner of the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool, exactly opposite to him.

But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne.
The doctors are embalming the corpse, and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel.”
“I am in a fever,” said she; “I have not slept a single instant during all this long night.
“Yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you expect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost.
“You think the count will be angry with me?”
Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the English fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.
“Lackeys?” grumbled the cardinal.
“Isn’t there a great and grand one—the convent of Jesuits?”
Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case.
A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.

“Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.”
Time was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day.
“Other men may have entered before them and waited for them.”
Bertuccio!” cried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.
“In the king’s name!” cried Comminges.
There is very little amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder.
“That is different,” replied Monte Cristo; “but if you intend to tell an untruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.”
That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner’s knife.
“You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is I.”
“An old acquaintance,” replied Grimaud.
Mousqueton was, however, somewhat consoled by D’Artagnan, who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon, which was near Corbeil, or Bracieux, which was near Melun, and of Pierrefonds, which was between Compiegne and Villars-Cotterets.

He continued his walk, but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces, when a furious fellow, leaning between two soldiers, spat in the king’s face, as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Nazareth.

The cold sweat sprang to the young man’s brow, and his teeth chattered.
The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study.
I do not wish to be left alone.”
He was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him.

The two friends were crouching down, meantime, behind a tub in the side alley.
“Let me see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.”
Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride.
D’Artagnan was too grand to promise anything; he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name.
“The Ancona road,” replied the baron.
Aramis assumed that perilous charge.
Jacopo will carry you to Leghorn, where Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar.
But where is my old friend Winter?”
“And you are very virtuous, are you not, Planchet?”
“Well, don’t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened.

However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your majesty to do him this honor.”
“Horror!” cried Porthos and Aramis.
“Touch nothing, my little friend,” cried the count eagerly; “some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.”
The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass, and called his sergeant.
Thanks for those sweet words!
“Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other day.”
Well, I tell you that I come to you from the cardinal.”
Chapter XLIII.
Our four friends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled together, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered.
“Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,—Thomson & French, the Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me.

Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed:
“Well,” said Valentine, “you may approve again, for grandpapa is again thinking of it.”

Bonacieux had made with him for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our hero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Tréville of women in general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess.
He knew that there was a trap-door communicating with a cellar, from which one could get into the orchard.

Latterly I heard his friend, Monsieur d’Artagnan, give him that name.”

“Mademoiselle,” said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, “I can give you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing—the young woman is a Greek.”
“Then the prince said: ‘Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier;’ which seems to me to leave no room for doubt, since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers.
“No—not at all.”

Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed.
“Go to bed, Planchet, and sleep soundly.”

“Then your Grace knows her real name?” asked Felton, in a sharp tone.
“He, that man!”

That was the question the three Musketeers put to one another.
I must find them within three days.”
Planchet!”

Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black servant.”

Villefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal.

You will find it in the water you drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.”
Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”
“Yes.”
“Everything will be forgotten, madame,” said Villefort.
“What were you doing?” replied she.

The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission.
“I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”

“For shame!” said Aramis.
Look closely!”
“Well, grandpapa,” said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to Maximilian, “I love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry another, I would destroy myself.”
“Have you the money he demands?”
“How much?” asked Danglars.
“Sell!” cried Mousqueton, about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left.
Richest, my dear fellow!”
“Oh, yes.”
“We wish to judge you according to your crime,” said Athos; “you shall be free to defend yourself.
As we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the Puritan.

“All.”

God help me!”
True, he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torlonia.

“I promised you a letter for the director of the Academy.

“Do you find yourself badly lodged, sister?
“I don’t see why; we are very comfortable in those we wear.”
Caderousse wrote the address.
“Oh, oh!” replied D’Artagnan, straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance, “it is the murmur of the populace in revolution.”
The particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance.
“Ah, you see——”

Having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal’s cloak, he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of them, he returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him without hesitation.
Thus illumined, Aramis read the following epistle:
And she looked at D’Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away.
Grimaud nodded the third time.
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man.

His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porthos.
“Yes, have you a plan?”
“Oh, what a dreadful event!” cried Maximilian.
Do you find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man, for Mercédès has declared she will kill herself if Dantès is killed.”

The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed, but they were leaning on them while they watched the game.
“He is dead.”
“My lord,” said Athos, “we are satisfied; we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship’s service and his most faithful servants.”
“And what name does he now bear?”
Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little?”
But he will make it up in you I am sure.
“Four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?”

“To what do you refer?
But consider, D’Artagnan,” added he, in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder, “consider that Béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings misery with her.
This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.
Bertuccio bowed, and left the room.
“And this officer,” asked Albert, “do you remember his name, signora?”
Our group would then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a Madonna.”
“It is not he who plays!” exclaimed Lucien; “it is Madame Danglars; she is indeed daring.”
“Yes, but in regard to myself, my lord, it cannot be so, for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your eminence.”
“You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.”
It is true the cardinal had been particularly ill-tempered.

Speak, then, I am all ears.”
Really, my dear Gérard, you are but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you, three days after the landing, ‘The usurper has landed at Cannes with several men.
“Yes, Milady; it is true you called her thus.”
“And is not above fifteen feet from it?”
“Who was your liberator?”
Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you, saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left.”

The king and his escort were no longer there.
Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning _poor M. Noirtier_, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay.”
“No, Hermine,” replied Debray; “you cannot make me believe that; on the contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count’s.
The inspector could not contend against this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._
“‘Ah,’ continued my father, still frowning, ‘their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them ‘food for cannon,’ which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain.
“Oh, beautiful life!
“What do you mean?” cried Rochefort.
His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads, carried by the breeze, until lost in the depths of the horizon.
“Friend,” said he, “for Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la Fère it is too little.
In a moment the whole party was assembled.
“Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.”
“I hope so, with all my heart,” said the Gascon, “and I confess my weakness.
“That is not prudent,” said Caderousse.
If his heart is free, and he will marry Haydée, the daughter of Ali Pasha of Yanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus accomplish my last wish.
The journey had seemed very long to Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short.
Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.
“Then you do not speculate?”
“Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his father.”
“Are the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers?”
“What is the matter, sir?” asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the commissioner.
With your lasso you could stop an ox?”
thou again!
I prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear.”
20061m
The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness.
“Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours, monsieur,” said the cardinal.
“And against whom?” cried the king.
And you go—”
“You understand me,” replied Villefort, affectionately; “when I say anyone,—pardon my urgency,—to anyone living I mean?”
Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance.

Shall I draw back my forehead from his embrace, or withhold my hand from his?
“What,” cried Morcerf; “you are, then, going to a hotel—that will be very dull for you.”
He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light.
Nor was that surprising.
I have done.” And D’Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis.
“Oh, what imprudence, my lord,” said D’Artagnan; “’tis not good to be about just here without a light.
“Monsieur Duke, at whatever price it may be, I will have them.”
“There is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting,” said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous tone.
‘Well, I fortunately recognize you!
M. de Tréville was not at his hôtel.
He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine.
SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS
“I in M. Noirtier’s apartment?”
“Well,” said Porthos, “in the first place make a bargain with the mercer, and a good bargain.”
Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was now the morning of the twenty-second.
“I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather, since he holds the money-chest!”
Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced.
Bonacieux, “my punishment is drawing to a close.
He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute, pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.
At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived, accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten followers.
An entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that, as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured?
I will shape it out for you with my knife.”
M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid.
While the struggle between day and night lasted, Dantès still doubted; but as soon as the daylight gained the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse.
“So I have been told already, monseigneur,” cried Bonacieux, giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, “but I swear to you that I know nothing about it.”
“I did not even draw my sword, but I took him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window.
“Reflect that I am your wife!”
“Go, sir, then,” said the queen; “you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know.”
“You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.”
“Upon what subject?” asked Madame Danglars.
“They have abducted her?
“The Black Musketeers, my lord.”
“They went to Rueil,” cried Aramis.
“No, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence.”
But how?
“Beauchamp is a worthy fellow,” said Monte Cristo, when the journalist was gone; “is he not, Albert?”
“Well, sire, for once he found his master.”
“I dance?”
“Chevalier!
She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty.
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him.
‘But,’ said the count, ‘so great was Ali Pasha’s confidence, that on his death-bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.’”
It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is magnificent.
D’Artagnan and his companions remembered their audience, and as they would very much have regretted that such an opportunity should be lost, they succeeded in calming their friends, who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the gates; but the gates were too strong.
Raoul obeyed.
All the servants surrounded her, offering her assistance.
“‘Delirium,’” he repeated; “‘delirium,’ do you say?

The mind can see as well as the body.
“Do you place confidence in our landlord—Monsieur Bonacieux?”
Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it.

“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.
Did you not tell me it was a family jewel?”
Neither of them had returned.
“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of police; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required all Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him.
“Listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face, paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to protect and preserve you for Maximilian.”
“_Permesso_?” inquired he.
“Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.”
Yes, appearances were against me and I was about to suffer dishonor.
Is it possible to insult you, madame?” said Athos, laughing; “he has insulted you, and he shall die!”
“Well, my friend, there is not a moment to lose; we must let the king know immediately.”
In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for D’Artagnan, which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
Neither had any.
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini.
I am no swordsman.”
“But I am sure of one thing—that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time.”
I held back his arm.
“The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,” said d’Avrigny, “and I will maintain this assertion before God and man.”
“‘But how,’ inquired I, ‘am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?’
“How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon?”
As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a scrutinizing glance—but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.
As a result she raised her head, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.
“They positively refused.”
Felton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.
“And to have ideas,” added Madame Danglars.
“Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant’s grave was dug.
“True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off.
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “can my suspicions be correct?
“Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds?
The money is nothing; that letter was everything.
“Heavens, Athos, a murder?” cried D’Artagnan.
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the basket on his arm.
Rita lay between them.
As he found himself in the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap.
The count listened and said no more.
D’Artagnan returned and again attacked him.
“Oh,” said Morrel, “I know not, indeed, if I may reveal this secret to mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me, count——” Morrel hesitated.
Morrel had looked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.
“Casa Pastrini!” said the _cicerone_ to the coachman, and the carriage drove rapidly on.
Don’t forget the signal: ‘Jesus Seigneur!’” and he went out as he came in, whistling the self-same air.
Although D’Artagnan was not of a very sentimental character, the mercer’s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart.
I rely on your friendship to assist me, Beauchamp, if contempt has not banished it from your heart.”
“Unhappily, those times are past.”

Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea.
Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman, the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man, who opened his eyes, at first entirely bewildered, but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him.
“Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you as wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.”
“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled with ice.
You cannot mean that!”
No, monsieur!
In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress.
By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors.
“Wait, madame,” continued Athos, “what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what I have narrated.”
“Thanks, count, no,” replied De Winter.
“But our troop horses?” said Aramis.
Peppino was decidedly an epicure.
A duel was the pretext for my wound.
Athos, in his turn, rising without speaking, went and unhooked his sword.
“Duke,” said the queen, blushing, “never speak of that evening.”
“Ah, sir!” cried Olivain, “what are you doing?
“Very well,” said Albert, extending his hand; “I swear I will not.”
The young girl perfectly understood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily.
“They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons, who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate.”
“Yes, I know him very well; and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister-in-law.”
“What do you prescribe, doctor?” demanded Villefort.
A single portrait, signed by Léopold Robert, shone in its carved and gilded frame.
Did you see poor Barrois die?” Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven.
During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape.
“Sir,” he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune—“sir, I cannot understand your generosity!”
“Permit me to assure your excellency,” said Bertuccio, “that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours.”
But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’
“Me?”
I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs, you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs.
At that moment Mme.
“Marechal de Grammont.”
Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around.
“Listen, Felton,” resumed Milady, “for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures.
“Rich!” said Mazarin, whom that single word always inspired with a great respect.
“Then you never believed in the principality?”
“If you have any preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes.
you may be easy, then—you’ll get there.”
Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.”
No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!
Mazarin did not even turn around.
get on!”
“Yes, your Eminence, it is the same.”
“Then your means, it appears, are improved; you have a capital house—your own, I presume?
“Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble,” said the count; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal.
Chapter LXIII.
We anchored our vessel—which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed—amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from Beaucaire to Arles.
The count had spoken correctly.
He is of no earthly use to anybody.”
“You are not convinced yet?”
Besides, the count will be in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.”
Has Changarnier been killed?
And he advanced to the window.
You know, gentlemen, that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant?”
However, we shall see.
“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by what means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work.
Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the end of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality.
Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral, a carriage, bearing the arms of Comminges, quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe, now entirely deserted.
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort.
THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK
What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you?
“You accept it, do you not?”
Was it not by chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house?
Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.
Chapter XXV.
And you have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor.
“Well, where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here?”
M. de Boville said nothing, but nodded his head, and took up the portfolio.
I, as a tender father——”
“And now,” he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman, which Faria had related to him, “now, Open Sesame!”
That is agreed upon.
“Oh, good Lord!
He tried to pass his body through the aperture, but not being like the frog in the fable, who thought he was larger than he really was, he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through.
Caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass—on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly, endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate—to the deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he went, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the entrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing.
“Ah, ah!
Seek not to console me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow—the wound is too deep and too fresh!
On reaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome is first visible, the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of Saint Peter’s, which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable.
“Bless me, I quite forgot the races.
“Listen to Aramis,” said his three friends.
“The three millions are probably on the road.”
Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone, that nothing but Morrel’s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them.
“What!” exclaimed Porthos, “mutton again?”
Comminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint Christophe.
“What is his name?”
“There is no Count of Monte Cristo” said Debray.
Poet as I am, I am intimate with Sarazin, who is devoted to the Prince de Conti, and with Monsieur de Bois-Robert, who, since the death of Cardinal Richelieu, is of all parties or any party; so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me.”

But putting his head out of the carriage:
Is he dead?
Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies.
“Oh, yes.”
“At last we are off!” exclaimed Porthos.
Come, accept my invitation, and my mother will thank you.”
“Yes, monsieur,” said the Englishman, bowing.
“Is it heaven that opens before me?” thought the dying man; “that angel resembles the one I have lost.”
“I wish to inform you, my lord,” replied Groslow, with an Irish accent, feigned of course, “that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find him.
He went therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose.
He stooped down, picked up the bag of money, and placed it between his teeth.
Very pretty!”
The jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_, the one who had thrown the violets to Albert, clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button-hole.
Believe me, there are only the two plans I have proposed to you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer.
“Come, come,” thought D’Artagnan, emerging from behind the curtain, “decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool; it is evident he has been brought up in a good school.”
“We’ll search Paris all day long,” said Athos, “and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to Picardy; and I feel no doubt that, thanks to D’Artagnan’s ready invention, we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts.”
Then one could enjoy charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress.

“A note which you will find at home will tell you.
Debray was not yet come, but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera.
And yet if we burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes?”
One light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’ chamber.
What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt?”
Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.
In short, Madame Danglars, not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person.
“That’s my idea, my lord; and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes, I should refuse it.
Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the recommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier into a Spanish bank.
Milady smiled with joy.
But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aramis.
The young girl no longer breathed, no breath issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no longer quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax.
Follow us at a distance of twenty paces, as far as the Louvre, and if anyone watches us, slay him!”
“No; of taste,” continued Franz gravely.
“No?” said Morrel; “you disapprove of this second project, as you did of the first?”
wait!” said Aramis; “that is an idea!”
Good luck to you.”
This second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the street was safer for him.
It was Caracalla’s circus.
Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else dictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before.
“You are in error, sir,” answered the queen.
“The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess.
“On the contrary, I do not find you the same person at all.”
“Then let him come in, if you please.”
“But if anyone should come here——”
The abbé smiled.
“Ah, it is you, monsieur!
“Back!” shouted D’Artagnan, “or you are dead!”
“Make ready!”
Porthos made no remark, but obeyed, with the sublime confidence he had in his friend.
“Ah; so much the better!” exclaimed the king.
The matter enters completely into the duties of the post.”
Nothing is so catching as confidence.
“In Madame de Villefort’s room?” he murmured and slowly returned, with one hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself against the wall.
“It was you who sent for me?”
“You understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,” said Valentine.
“Say at once you disapprove of my proposal.”
Chapter XXXII.
With every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who remained was not slackened.
“I?” said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.
“Was happily bought three days since.”
“Be careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.
Arrived at the barracks he made himself known, took the best horse in the stables, mounted and gained the high road.
“The mission with which I am charged, sir,” replied the visitor, speaking with hesitation, “is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.” The abbé bowed.
The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and wonderful texture.
Whilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winter’s, Athos, seated near his window, his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand, was listening intently to Raoul’s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle.
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army.
But whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without answering, went on with his dinner.
He was standing, his arms folded, near Rita, who was still insensible.
She lives; she is in safety in a convent; she is at Béthune!
As he said, he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so that he did not know which way to turn.
“But,” continued Aramis, “Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly retired.
Let us say no more about it.”
Monsieur d’Artagnan is my tenant, although he does not pay me my rent—and even better on that account ought I to know him.
During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound, and, until three o’clock in the morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation.
Athos made him a sign to come with them.
“They fire like grooms,” said Porthos.
“Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean,” said Danglars, almost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man; “ruined—yes, that is it.”
And he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted.
“Not badly answered, i’faith,” said Gondy, laughing; “but I have, you must know, always had, in spite of my bands, warlike inclinations.”
You understand—no more delay.”
You see he has a truly royal escort.”
“Fifty thousand francs a year,” said Porthos.
“He regrets the devil!
“And the result of that letter——”
“Yes, so long as he pays me——”
“In that case,” said Mazarin, “I think it must please me best to remain; not only on account of my own interest, but for your safety.”
Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word.
“Does Grimaud know him, then?”
Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment.
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “and God,—I cannot say in justice, for his justice would have slain you,—but God, in his mercy, spared your life.”
Not at all.
Mousqueton, witnessing this despair, melted into tears in a corner of the room.

“Badly, monsieur, badly!” replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber.
“Return at five o’clock and I will tell you; but do not breathe to a living soul, sir, the rendezvous which I give you.”
“’Tis the same thing—you understand me, D’Artagnan—a court.”
He bowed respectfully to the king, who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception, but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which, from his infancy, Louis XIV.
“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really saved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.
On his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de Londres.
To come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator; to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them _bassette_, _passe-dix_, and _lansquenet_, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a month—all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.
Seventeen months’ captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited.
“No.
“Well, be it so, then.
“Do you wish to go on the water, sir?” said the sailor.
When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called, one of those brief but solemn silences ensued, which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial.
“That is to say,” replied Villefort with hesitation, “that human nature being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.”
There was no response.
“I listen to you, and I wonder at you, sir,” said the queen.
The following day, about three o’clock, a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.
“Ah!
“You must know that in France they are very particular on these points; it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, ‘We love each other, and want you to marry us.’ Marriage is a civil affair in France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity.”
Then he rested; he must be near Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going.
His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost breathless.
“Tomorrow, flame of my life!”
“Oh, my God!” cried Mme.
“Are you still bent on departure, Athos?” asked D’Artagnan.
“Like everything else, with money; but it cost me dear.”
“Release Broussel!” she cried, “never!”
D’Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook his head.
D’Avrigny put his hand to his heart, and placed a glass before his lips.
Return, Emmanuel, to your charming wife, and present my best compliments to her; and do you, Morrel, accompany me to the Champs-Élysées.”
“I reply, my lord, ’tis but little, as certainly I shall not go alone.”
It could no longer be doubted; the family name was fully given.
I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man.”
And why is it impossible?”
“I know that Porthos was in a fair way,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as to Aramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his account.
And he held out to the concierge the notary’s order.

“That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent.”
“That’s pretty positive,” continued D’Artagnan; “but after all, it is but a menace.”
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated.
“Yes; well?”
“Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars?
The _Pharaon_ is entering the harbor!”
We left Paris, each with seventy-five pistoles in his pocket.”
“Thank you,” said Monte Cristo; “now you must permit me to take my leave of you.”
“Let out your prisoner.
This arrangement pleased every one.
“Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition.
“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that it was a stone of immense value?”
You may see matters differently, D’Artagnan, and think otherwise.
The investigation would begin at eight o’clock that evening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour.
Thus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a framework of trees.
And he darted on beside his friend, who had already begun a fresh pursuit.
and Alexander VI.
“There is,” said he, at the end of his meditations, “a clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.
It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos; a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence.
To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical, but actual.
“Well?”
“No; for your skill with the sword is so well known.”
what art thou about?
I am not your uncle, I know you not.”
“Mother,” said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter, “what has occurred—what has happened?
“I think not, sir,” replied M. Cavalcanti; “in Italy the nobility generally marry young.
“Peste, if he is giving away hats like that, Porthos, let us look out and both demand a regiment to-morrow.
“And it is not yours?”
“And to me, too.”
At dessert D’Artagnan reposed in his chair, crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease.
Athos made a step toward Milady.
“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom.
It is my mistress you love; you told me so just now.”
Do not leave me!
Come, come, tell me; I am dying with curiosity and uneasiness!”
Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide.
“Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?” said Morrel with tearful eyes.
A private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.
and Madame de Villefort have just left this room, have they not?”
Do you think so?
“There is something in what you have just said,” said Beauchamp, laughing.
“Impostor,” repeated Villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others.
“Well, what then?”
“Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.”
“Follow me,” said an officer, who came up behind the guards.
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery.
As to love, the only woman he could have loved was Mme.
Ah!
I am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in France.
But wait a moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet.
A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise.” And Danglars sighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before.
“Disguised.”
“How can I?”
Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident, Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed.
“What, for me only?” cried Caderousse, “ah, sir, do not jest with me!”
“I am much attached to that horse, Athos.”
“No politics, Caderousse.
“Exactly so,” said the delighted major.

It would be very kind of you.”
“The name is not unknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-Méran!” and he appeared to meditate.
“It means that I have just returned from Yanina.”
On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling, according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon: “Monsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.”
The moon, which was partially obscured by heavy clouds, now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels, or silvered the walls, the roofs, and the spires of the town that Charles I. had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops, whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement.
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window.

When D’Artagnan had finished, he said, “Hum!
“Take Bazin.”
We have arranged the ransom of each of them—2,000 on arriving in France.
In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open.
The guide took them, thinking them merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch revealed their true worth.
AUTHOR’S PREFACE
This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux.
see!
Gentlemen and citizens, set me free; I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Mazarin.
Then enclosing Monte Cristo’s receipt in a little pocket-book, he added:—“Yes, come at twelve o’clock; I shall then be far away.”
“It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,” said Monte Cristo.
“Meanwhile, madame, if you really suffer,” said Felton, “a physician shall be sent for; and if you deceive us—well, it will be the worse for you.
“You sent for me?” he said to the prisoner.
I approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though trying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.
Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would have remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town.
yes, my lord,” said the young man, with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein.
“She will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes you.
I defy you to find him who executed it.”
“Why, in truth, sir,” was Monte Cristo’s reply, “man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you said, I think, that I had nothing else to do.
“You are, indeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”
Mme.
“I think so, indeed!
The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes; the man preserved profound silence, and remained perfectly motionless.
“Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you succeed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again behold Valentine.”
He then formed a resolution.
The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily.
For that night, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.”
The diminutive Abbé Scarron, who, however, was an abbé only because he owned an abbey, and not because he was in orders, had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans, which he inhabited.

“In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?”
40012m
Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and understood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to have an undue power over me.
The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the second floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pincio.
“And you would do well, if you are afraid of his recovering; for you know, if a wound in the head does not kill at once, it is cured in a week.”
I waited a month, or rather I suffered for a month!
For example, supposing it were the daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling the dice.”
“Wasn’t his name Faria?” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor.
On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms.
Mazarin smiled, but became very pale.
“Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.”
my house?”
I did go to Monsieur d’Artagnan’s.”
“Well, don’t be inactive.”
The streets were crowded, for it was the day of Pentecost, and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers; one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox, the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle.
where are you?” murmured Coquenard, and he tried to smile.
Fortunately, I was so well concealed that he could not find me.
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”
“Well, then, I will content myself with arresting you!”
He turned back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to hear the voice of one in sorrow.
Speak!”
Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess.
“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,” said the count.
It was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity.
He described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket, “You, our friend, our intelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission.
“And I am still mourning her loss,” exclaimed the major, drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye.
Do you not comprehend?”
“Yes, my Lord,” replied the young man, confused.
“Well, then, I am your servant, Monsieur Baron,” said D’Artagnan, “though you have names rather difficult to recollect.” And touching his horse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris.
“Oh, but this time perhaps she will follow your advice.”
Morcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to the point.
“‘In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which you still owe me.’”
“Great city,” murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as if in prayer, “less than six months have elapsed since first I entered thy gates.
D’Artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner.
“Well,” said Felton, “only promise till you have seen me again.
The cardinal’s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence.
To you I will say, ‘Have you not, madame, put aside some of the surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?’”
“Why, it seems that I crushed for him a parliament councillor.”
Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also—you recollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother, and very nearly killed them?
I will be with you directly.”
“What is that?”
The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able now to do more than detest them—I despise them.”
“Oh, your Eminence knows him well,” cried Milady, carried away by her anger.
“Go on, go on,” replied D’Artagnan, laughing heartily; “relate your story and I will applaud it if it is a good one.”
“Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed; you can turn their suspicions and save my life!”
“Eugénie has left us!”
“Since there is no harm,” said Athos, “in my knowing that D’Artagnan is here, I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am here.”
The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having, as he said, cleaned his drawing-paper for him; he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarin’s life.
Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry.
Do you know him?
“Just the person we require at a time like the present,” said a second.
“I will go on foot, then.”
“Pardon, gentlemen—par—” murmured the voice, which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds.
“Alas!
The minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who set all Europe against her.
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary—for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion.
On entering the hotel D’Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire.
After this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk’s eye upon poor Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.
d’Avrigny, M. d’Avrigny,” cried she, in a stifled voice.
They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation.
“Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his father.
“I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me.”
They broke open the doors and searched the dwelling, but in vain.
I let him place the box in the hole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast, exclaiming:
“The very sum you named,” whispered the inspector in his turn.
Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work.
“Nothing, nothing!
Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust:
“At any hour you will.”
He started when he saw Renée, for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dantès.
“No,” replied Noirtier eagerly.
No.
Continue, and say what we must do now.”
“And now, my good friend,” said D’Artagnan to him, “I must invite you to deprive yourself, for my sake, of your hat and cloak.”
“He will not go today,” said D’Artagnan; “but here, I’ll pay you for us two.”
You are coming, my boy!”
“‘You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’”
“I shall say it, and you?”
“I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back to us soon.” This _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputy’s ears.
A long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the ground.
“I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès, “if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?”
Grimaud’s first intention had been to return to Paris, but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul, and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour’s riding would unite them, and that the going, returning and explanation would not occupy an hour, he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazingarbe.
“You!
“That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to fight.”
“And to you—a good journey.”
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon D’Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.
Thus, it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover’s arm.
“Listen, madame,” said Gondy.
Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime.
“The uniform of the king’s musketeers carries a certain respect with it, and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns.”
“Precisely,” said the count; “six years since I bought a horse in Hungary remarkable for its swiftness.
if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I would blow his brains out with my own hand!”
“Yes, I see, for the young man Raoul,” said D’Artagnan.
I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but do not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.
“Where?” asked D’Artagnan.
It is easy to suppose that Morrel’s agitation would not escape the count’s penetrating eye.
You have scarcely seen my mother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely.
“Ah, my God, my God!” murmured the poor mercer, “now, indeed, I am lost!” And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and without resistance.
_Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”
“I will go to the second after attending the first,” said D’Artagnan.
Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies; D’Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a provocation—whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its scabbard.
A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop; this latter party was composed of ill-looking fellows, who resembled bandits more than anything else; they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eustache.
“A true friend’s eloquence is so powerful, my lord, that you have reassured me.
And you, baron,” pursued the count, addressing Franz, “do you also depart tomorrow?”
This affair, like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in Paris.
“It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand.
M. de Villefort followed them.
“You?”
“We should have heard the blow, then.”
M. Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had returned to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an instant.
Twenty times he interceded for Edmond.
Then, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some retired baker.
“Oh, yes, I heard that.”
Athos stopped.
Answer me, do not these crimes exist?”
“Why so?”
Debray?” inquired Danglars, with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker’s domestic life.
“Suppose,” he said, “we roughly chalk out a career for this young man.
Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of _La Jeune Amélie_ (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provençal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence, as they have no visible means of support.
Will that satisfy you?”
“And how did he look?” asked Porthos, who, perceiving that D’Artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop, profited by it to put in a word or two.
“Impossible!”
“Here are forty double pistoles, my dear friend,” said D’Artagnan, taking the sum from his pocket; “I know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems.”
“Himself.
We are here to guard the gate, and no one whom we do not know shall pass.”
Franz, who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was strangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert’s request, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a short delay, the count joined them in the salon.
If God were just, you know how many would be punished who now escape.”
Truly, it is only bastards who are thus fortunate.
“‘I come to ask to be your captain,’ said the young man.
The two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome.
“When one is going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.”
And as D’Artagnan, as he spoke, looked at Harrison, the colonel imagined the toast was for himself.
“Good; it is you, accordingly, that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain.”
“Of what use would it be?
The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the staircase.
“The apparent reason, at least,” said Madame de Villefort.
“Ah,” said he, “I hear a human voice.” Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner—he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron.
All the same,” resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate, “they are brave fellows!
He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground.
The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.
“Excuse me,” said the banker, “but you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.”
“Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once?”
“No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs!
Mme.
What is done is done.
“Oh, if I had my three friends here,” cried he, “I should have, at least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of them?”
“Ah, my lord, if I mistake not, the Chevalier d’Artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards; but take care, for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal.”
“So Franz must wait.
“Whom do you bring?” asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo; “is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.”
“All this negotiation must be carried on openly.”
“I quite agree with you,” said Morcerf; “and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out.
Of what nature?”
“Are you there?” asked Porthos.
“Do you know the woman who has just entered that box?”
“Ah,” said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern, forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance, despite her fifty years—“ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here, that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and station was truly our ‘Louis the well-beloved,’ while their wretched usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their ‘Napoleon the accursed.’ Am I not right, Villefort?”
It will then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit.”
“Well, never mind how it is,” answered Albert, “it comes to the same thing in the end.
“God has preserved us hitherto, God will preserve us still.”
“So much the worse, sir,” said Anne of Austria; “so much the worse, at least for the queen, for to-day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion.”
no, never!
“Child!” sighed Mercédès.
Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned?”
“‘At least, replace the diamond in the ring,’ said La Carconte sharply.
In Heaven’s name, my dear Athos, do not make a useless sacrifice.
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch-patrol.
Besides, he is an Englishman.
“Now,” asked Athos, “what are we to do with ourselves till evening?
I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired, but he is fascinated with his Luccanese.
“Pardieu!
“Shall I see you again ere my departure?” asked Albert.
“So there is,” said D’Artagnan, and he read:
“D’Artagnan!” cried Rochefort.
You were told to guard her—to fire at her if she attempted to fly.
“One last favor, my Lord!” said he to the baron.
“You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?” asked the notary.
“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort.
“My dear friend,” said D’Artagnan, “if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say.”
I was uneasy about him.”
Their horses were fed, but not unsaddled; the grooms supped, for it was already late, and their two masters, impatient to return, appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one.
I alone can save you, and I will.”
This noble gentleman with his lofty glance, this handsome cavalier, so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command!
Dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor.
Why didn’t they search more vigilantly?
But before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man of thirty, gentleman all over,—that is, with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemart,—took Albert’s hand.
The first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four friends.
“_Monsieur and dear friend_—”
And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method.
“Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” announced Baptistin.
By its side, on her knees, and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and sobbing, her hands extended above her head, clasped and stiff.
D’Artagnan and Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.
“Oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?” exclaimed Valentine, perceiving all these signs of agitation.
“Yes,” replied the man, “but at what a price!”
“It was very polite of you.”
He then tried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he perceived that Athos staggered.
Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a side look at Valentine, which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room.
“Not at all, madame, but here, sleeping in his bed.”
Sit down there, before me, D’Artagnan; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.” And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed.
“On my honor.”
Chapter VI.
He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street.
“On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.”
“Then it is understood,” said D’Artagnan; “you would rather be killed than desert your post?”
“You are adorable, madame.”
The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, “Your friend is decidedly mad.”
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “as there is no longer any fear of being overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.”
“As for me,” replied Aramis, “I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation—of which I formed one—went yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on you.
Have you a carriage?”
“The death of your prince?”
I make a match?
“Let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward.”
One of the sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley, and Dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they were mooring the boat.
On whom does my bleeding heart repose?
At sight of him Madame de Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child still closer towards her, she said:
“Yes, his mother.”
“Lucien, a great event has happened!” said the lady, glancing inquiringly at Lucien,—“M.
The next day the prisoner’s room was full of pictures and mottoes.
“For a thousand pistoles?”
Why, the thing has made a tremendous noise.”
The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf.
This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort.
“Ah, cursed priest!” cried Anne, when he had retired, stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door, “one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to-day.”
Adieu; I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him.”
“When I shall lay my head on the block and say ‘Remember!’ then strike boldly.”
The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired, that she turned away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more like a groan.
“Yes.”
Mazarin nodded an assent, but wishing to know what this prediction was, about which they disputed, he remained in the same place.
“What do you mean, sir!”
I acted well as a man, but you have acted better than man.
Bertuccio raised the lantern, and obeyed.
They were very happy.
“‘Hear me,’ said he; ‘this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.’”
It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place.
“Anne de Bueil!
After the king and the cardinal, M. de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens.
“You see, then,” said D’Artagnan, “that I must have that letter.
“I pardon you,” said he, “for the poisoning of my brother, and the assassination of his Grace, Lord Buckingham.
But listen!
Mazarin reflected.
“You have given your word, then?”
Do not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting.
“Very well, sir,” said the host, “I’ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant, and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain.”
Good journey to him!”
“‘All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,’ replied M. de Villefort; ‘they fancy that their countryman is still emperor.
Accept that which the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman, and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.
As to Felton, he hesitates.
“Beautiful?”
Kitty, who was to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next chamber.
I understood that I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard, so I decided upon descending to the garden.
“Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?”
And he entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the child went to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night.
“Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try, in his turn, to lay hands on us.”
“He is a bad priest,” said Porthos, “who has pity for heretics.”
While doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.
The duke signed.
Come, your excellency,” the count added, turning to Franz, “here is Luigi Vampa, who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed.”
“I am innocent.”
“My God, my God!” cried D’Artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure.
“Ah!
“Oh, don’t be afraid, sir,” replied Aramis; and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the Louvre.
Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped?”
“A million?”
Planchet and Bazin shall go.
The count’s cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth.
“On my honor, I have no idea.”
“No, no,—by no means,” said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground.
And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit.
In hôtels that do not flourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host.
“In the name of our child!
“I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion,” he muttered.
The bottle was covered with spiders’ webs, and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man’s face.
Every one grows childish in prison, but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become so.
“Madame, I have pledged my word, and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to return.”
ah!” said Porthos, opening his eyes at that last word.
Have you informed him of it?”
“None, I swear to you.”
“Oh, I am quite sure.
M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.
I will appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit, as you term him?
“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of Frosinone.
He then withdrew, and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money.
“Come, then, I see that I must trust unreservedly to you.”
Going along, D’Artagnan, shaking his head, said:
“What matter?
“Your excellencies are aware,” responded the landlord, swelling with importance, “that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves!”
“If you take one step farther, D’Artagnan,” said he, “we shall cross swords together.”
The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the shutter was opened a little way.
At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein; half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down.
Suddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for D’Artagnan.
Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter Marseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain, quiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.
I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation, that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you.
Look.”
This account confirmed that of the mayor.
Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”
“Well!” cried D’Artagnan, “tell us all about it.”
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her.
“Oh, your pardon!
The room was inundated with blood, dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man, speechless; the monk had disappeared.
“That is quite my desire.”
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper.
“And thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall.”
“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined.
You are in a shocking hurry to be off—you forget one of my guests.
Chapter XXXIX.
“My dear fellow,” replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, “remember, for the future, Napoleon’s maxim, ‘Never awaken me but for bad news;’ if you had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have been grateful to you all my life.
What the devil are you doing?”
“Oh, monsieur,” said the concierge, “I shall not have much cause to regret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was here last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him in anything at all.”
I know the world is a drawing-room, from which we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts of honor paid.”
The proposition had been made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven o’clock struck.
You will excuse me, will you not?
“Reverend sir,” murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which the count pitilessly blocked—“reverend sir, I don’t know—believe me—I take my oath——”
“Come, my friend,” said he, “courage.” Then he turned to the officer.

A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M. Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests.
In about the space of a second a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia.
He had gone to the rendezvous, had encountered there the adversary indicated, whose name he had never known, had given him a pretty sword-stroke on the arm, then had gone toward Aramis, who at the same time came to meet him, having already finished his affair.
The sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_, the darkness which had replaced the light, and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil, had left in Franz’s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness.
Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady, who smiled.
“Take my last gold,” muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book, “and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty—I only ask to live!”
“And do you know who is his lieutenant?”
Danglars followed Edmond and Mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas; then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song.
“But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?” inquired the Englishman.
“And you—you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke,” replied Aramis.
At nine o’clock, then, be ready here at the hôtel, I will come and take you.”
“What, Planchet, is Monsieur d’Artagnan here?”
On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the ministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No.
Kitty drew a little note from her bosom.
This singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy.
Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world; but the voice was all.
“Then,” replied Grimaud, “you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed.” He saluted and made a movement to depart.
Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell into a deep, heavy slumber.
Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt.
“Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me.”
Let this house be the first repaid, my son, and respect this man.”
the general doubted my fidelity?”
Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o’clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti, whom the banker persisted in calling prince, a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo’s house, and the count was preparing to go out.
“What is this light?” asked he.
“The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us, promising at the same time to obtain the queen’s consent to it.”
“My lord,” he asked, “where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged?”
“That’s right.
“Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.”
But if you think the king’s life is not worth what it must cost there’s an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am ill.”
By that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme simplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so often met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King of France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew, they sometimes came to seek refuge.
“Well, then, speak!”
“Thanks, monsieur.”
“‘That is, the night, my lord,’ I answered.
“No,” said Andrea,—“no; it is useless for you to say so, count.
The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed, instead of—as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy—going home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,—is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner.
At length Athos went to bed, apparently, for the noise ceased.
The Corsican Ogre Chapter 12.
A slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès.
“Pardi,” answered Athos “we only carried off his mother; the king has spoiled him of his name and property.”
Most of my readers are aware that the second act of _Parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while sleeping, betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo.
“Friend Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, handing the letter to him, “this time, at least, you are sure of your title of baron, and I of my captaincy.
Tréville said to himself: “If the cardinal has set this young fox upon me, he will certainly not have failed—he, who knows how bitterly I execrate him—to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him.
it fills me with pride to find that, thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed, I am approved by a man like you, fresh from the court.”
External existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream.
“Well.”
“No.”
“I remember it,” said Athos.
Anticipating your wishes, I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages, and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,” continued he, addressing the boy with a smiling air, “will have the honor of driving you home, while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash.
This amused him sometimes a little, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not prevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of returning to Paris—so that if the messengers and the spies had failed, his Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found himself much embarrassed.
The duke was at Windsor hunting with the king.
“Yes, sir,” replied Franz.
“No.”
Raised to the height of twenty feet, so as to be on a level with the window, it had two lower stories.
The dim light, the profound silence, and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more by her own conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work.
I possess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and my grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran, will leave me as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir.
“So, then?” said Athos, offering his hand to D’Artagnan.
“Amuse yourself with Milady, my dear D’Artagnan; I wish you may with all my heart, if that will amuse you.”
“Do you think you can behead me with a single blow?” asked the king.
“I like Rustaud, my lord; a good animal, whose paces suit me.”
The young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.
“Well,” said Gondy, “have you kept your word with me?”
You are abused, sir; but that is not the question.
The conversation took place in English—a language which D’Artagnan could not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage.
“It is the same.”
This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry.
When well assured this search was superfluous, he followed D’Artagnan, wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had become of her.
“D’Artagnan, you restore me to life!” cried Aramis.
“Now, D’Herblay,” said Athos, “dismount and come here.”
Morrel said not a word.
“Take my arm, madame,” said the stranger, “and let us continue our way.”
Wait!”
Milady reseated herself, foaming.
Aramis and D’Artagnan whispered to each other.
The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count’s visage, or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders.
COMTE DE WARDES
Chapter IV.
Chapter XLIV.
He was charming.
oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature.
“Then we are once more reunited?” said Andrea.
The people, kept back by Louvieres, had not made another step forward; but the awful murmuring, which indicates an angry people, continued.
But to return to our millions.”
“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”
“You have seen, my dear Albert—I ask the question as a mother—you have seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much knowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you think the count is really what he appears to be?”
“Well?”
Then, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with which he was about to part.
“Has your resolution changed, Valentine?”
Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes from.
This reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure.
“He is named Planchet, who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago; but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared.”
She tried to replace the arm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse.
The young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his good fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not restore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch, took aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree.
Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself to close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost impossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth.
“D’Avrigny,” said Villefort, “be so kind, I beseech you, as to accompany this gentleman.
The thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, _“La savate—La savate!”_26 a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but with an iron-heeled one.
The fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition.
But now hasten on board, I will join you there ere long.”
“Most undoubtedly,” replied Monte Cristo; “your father, Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti.” The expression of terror which, for the moment, had overspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared.
It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them.
“Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know.”
Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment.
Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”
“Go, I tell you.”
“Yes.”
Then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist.
“Where to?”
“So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?” continued the false abbé.
“I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne.
I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment.
Madame de Villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then swam, she staggered towards the door and disappeared.
“But no,” said Valentine,—“no, I tell you it is all past, and it was nothing.
The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor.
Five minutes later he came down the grand staircase.”
I am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the Porte Saint-Martin and Gaîté, who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren.
“Yes, do you know, I am very glad to hear you give that testimony; the cardinal has some good in him, and if he were not a foreigner—well, he would be more justly estimated.
I told her of the scaffold; oh, Heavens, I forgot that it awaits me also!
His devotion to the queen was boundless; men of loyalty are scarce.”

“And your friend, for instance; what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion?”
Mazarin, who was sitting at a table folding up papers, as if he had only been a secretary of state, looked up.
Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him.
“Barrois?” said she.
“What shall I do!” he uttered, and reflected for a moment; “shall I ring?
I am from the country.”
“Well,” said Albert in a determined tone, “you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family, and I insist on a retractation being made.”
Take care my cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.
He was, then, as punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say.
Besides, although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before.”
“Meditate and consider as much as you like,” replied Porthos, who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn.
“My lord, I ought to have a fortune of six millions, but it has been taken from me.”
He conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks.
“What would you have?
“Indeed,” said Maximilian, “I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good.”
My misgivings had been but too true.
Describe to me your abduction, I pray you.”
“I come to congratulate you.”
“_Ma foi_,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy, and you know I am a speculator.”
Section 4.
‘Willingly, my young cavalier,’ said the priest, ‘if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber.’
“A man!”
The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in the council of the king, had been always rejected.
Proceed, sire, I beg.
What do you intend doing?” Valentine held down her head; she was overwhelmed.
“Well, this is what you have to say,” said D’Artagnan: “_My Lord, your sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother, being already married in France, and having been_—” D’Artagnan stopped, as if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.
What has he done?
“‘Sir,’ replied Haydée, ‘the Count of Monte Cristo, my foster-father, has been in Normandy the last three days.’
A moment after, those who, surprised by this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw the door open, and four men, clothed in black, not _come_ out of it, but _fly_, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to say, patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.
“This will teach you,” said D’Artagnan, “to treat the guests God sends you in a more courteous fashion.”
D’Avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead, and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier.
The young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell.
“Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who adored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart.
D’Artagnan looked at Porthos.
“And you still bid me hope?”
Leave the room, and send me a woman.”
“‘What does he mean?’ asked a gendarme.
Although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step.
“Yes!” said Dantès, and without relinquishing Mercédès’ hand clasped in one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.
Sit down, and let us talk it over.”
“For what you have just said.”
“You notice my ring?” said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends.
Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave.
“But what?”
“Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.”
“Near Blois.
“And you will leave the command to him?”
I retained my harness by instinct.
Time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses.
“‘Monsieur,’ I replied, ‘it is not for myself that I entreat your interference—I should grieve for him or avenge him, but my poor brother had a wife, and were anything to happen to me, the poor creature would perish from want, for my brother’s pay alone kept her.
“Yes, madame, I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty.
Three curates remained—those of St. Merri, St. Sulpice and St. Eustache.
Not a word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails, the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other.
“Oh, mon Dieu!
“In a pate?” said La Ramee.
“Of what use to-day?
“How many are there?”
As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing more.
1.F.4.
We have already observed with what rapidity D’Artagnan seized the expression of a countenance.
Adieu!
“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de Saint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”
“So!” thought the Gascon “here’s a young blade who has already his love affair, who doesn’t at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair sex.
Chapter 52.
Every one was impatient, La Ramee to sit down to table, the guards to go and drink, the duke to escape.
“‘Yes, but it does not; I am rancorous—the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman.
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment.
You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread, a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet, who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands.”
We were then convinced, my friend and I, that there was some error of which we were the victims, and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves.
At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear.
What hatred she distills!
“Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter—has already offered me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a loan of money, as though he were a banker.”
“Then we shall not meet in Paris?”
“Come, D’Artagnan,” said Porthos, “bid adieu to your sword and go with me to Pierrefonds, to Bracieux, or to Du Vallon.
Chapter LII.
“Diable!” he exclaimed when the door was shut, “they seem to have the greatest need of me just now.”
The executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one stroke opened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently on it with his feet.
“Yes, count, and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to accept my excuses.”
I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forestalled.
The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man.
“That will serve us for a relay,” said Athos.
“The bastion St. Gervais,” replied D’Artagnan, “from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our workmen.”
“M.
“Madame, these are my orders; excuse me.
“Wonderfully,” said D’Artagnan; “but I come to offer you a dress which will become you still better.”
And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward.
News from your father, do you hear, Henrietta?
“Athos?” said she; “wait a moment.”
“What do you say?” said the count; “900,000 francs?
As he touched the ground, he opened his eyes.
For one second, D’Artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword; but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and D’Artagnan recognized the coadjutor.
D’Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.
He received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other.
“Hush!
“Still that idea of death, madame,” said Villefort.
“What have you seen?—come, tell me!”
“Anne,” said he, “you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease, knowing that you can do it with impunity.
“I only suppose so.
The duke, in his turn, bowed, and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud, who kept behind La Ramee.
Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and double-locked.
She saw vaguely the future; but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.
“Ah, what a misfortune!” exclaimed the duchess, playing carelessly with her fan.
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” continued the queen, “I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment, but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the first.”
“I understand,” said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Ali’s pantomime; “you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.”
“However——”
He promised.
It had been said that evening a hundred times—and Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject; he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether, but one despairing effort saved him.
I am lost!
“The king has no authority here!” answered a deep voice, which seemed to proceed from a cloud, so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust.
The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend.
“Yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.”
“And where, I pray you?”
As for that Benedetto, who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?”
“We invite him to play to-night; he has invited us in return to-morrow.
One night more and he would be on his way.
Vampa was twelve, and Teresa eleven.
“So he’s called Mouston,” thought D’Artagnan; “’tis too long a word to pronounce ‘Mousqueton.’”
But the glass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies.
I was dancing the galop at Torlonia’s with the Countess G——.” Then he drew his watch from his pocket, that he might see how time sped.
In a moment he was on the ground.
The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way, and bordered with tombs.
“Take them to yonder shed, my friend,” said Aramis, pointing to a low building on the plain; “there you will find hay and straw for them; then come back here and clap your hands three times, and we will give you wine and food.
“Did Barrois make your lemonade?”
nothing good,” replied D’Artagnan, shaking his head.
Chapter XLVII.
Athos understood all now.
And pray upon what shall I make my campaign; upon Grimaud?”
“How far is Mazingarbe?”
He is a fine young man, of fair complexion—a little too fair, perhaps—pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for yourself.”
“It ought to do so, at least.”
I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped.
Besides, be assured, my dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation.
“And where are these four men?”
“To the point, sir,” said the queen, “to the point, and answer me, yes or no; if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor?
I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my pardon; but upon one condition.”
“That man,” said Milady, lowering her voice, “is my brother.”
“That is because your fancies go too far,” replied the triumphant Bonacieux, “and I mistrust them.”
“What!
Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments, while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns.
“Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose.”
However, it does not signify; he has a letter of credit on me, so I must see him when he requires his money.”
“Which?”
If you go out, do not go out alone; when you eat, use every precaution.
You will kill yourself,” cried Planchet.
There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor.
Every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations.
An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk.
Athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud.
“The baron appears thoughtful today,” said Monte Cristo to her; “are they going to put him in the ministry?”
“Ah, my dear fellow,” said Albert, rising, and lighting his third cigar, “really, I thought you had more courage.”
Noirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an explanation.
La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes, his alarm every moment increasing.
Whose is the sand upon which we were reclining?
“The devil!” said Porthos; “what can we say to Mazarin?”
All at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight horsemen.
It is a duel, then?” cried Mordaunt, as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation.
“No, my lord, and I will set out at once.
It was Mousqueton, who was obeying his master’s command.
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure.
All these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire Porthos favorably.
This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de Paris, so that the innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Mauléon, 25 Rue Saint-Dominique, that being the name and address on the card.
Dantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond.
Oh, I am guilty, then; you will not pardon me?”
“I thought,” said Franz to the count, “that you told me there would be but one execution.”
“I am looking for the person who let down the ladder.
King, judges, spectators, all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated.
Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close behind her.
“Why, I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily.”

Thence he saw the king, the queen and Monsieur Mazarin, and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty.
“Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?”
* This poire d’angoisse was a famous gag, in the form of a pear, which, being thrust into the mouth, by the aid of a spring, dilated, so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width.
Then an idea came to him which harmonized everything.
I ask for it; without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the alarm.
That was a great honor for D’Artagnan and for Porthos.
“Ah!
Bonacieux was.
You spent it as you pleased; that was your business.
“This is all very fine, dear Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan.
De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply.
There was a great press of people in M. de Villefort’s antechamber, but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name.
“To begin with, tell me,” said she, “how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival, but even of the day, the hour, and the port at which I should arrive?”
In a few words, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.
“I do not believe you,” cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible tortures.
The Burglary Chapter 83.
Permit me, then, my dear Athos, without inquiring further about our friend, to pay my respects to M. Planchet.”

“Now, sir,” said the count, “you are safe—calm yourself.”
Here and there on the walls of the staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the flickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above.
“Impossible, doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up.
“Well,” said Andrea, “admitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?”
It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight o’clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during the night learn the letter by heart.
Well, by means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.”
Anne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter, expected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her.
“Women are very indiscreet, my sister.
He has shown very great courage and resolution, for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us, and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces.
The murderer, supposing him dead, let fall his head and disappeared.
“You mean George Villiers?” asked Felton, whose looks became excited.
Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to speak, my friend; but be laconic, I beg.
Athos, as the name of Raoul was pronounced, looked inquisitively at D’Artagnan, in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face.
One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse.
I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief.
Without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M. Bonacieux—lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty well accustomed—the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting.
Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of refusal.
What the count said was true—the most curious spectacle in life is that of death.
“I think nothing; I quote a fact, that is all.
In this kind of game, not to kill is to let one’s self be killed.
“Yes, no doubt.
“Take ten men of my Guardsmen, and search the two houses thoroughly.”
“Adieu, gentlemen,” said De Comminges; “sleep well!”
That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan.
Still, as I have already told you, I have an instinctive affection for him, the source of which I cannot explain to you.
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought in at its usual time.
Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live, and so far he had always fulfilled his word.
“Yes,” he answered, “if a fortune brings consolation, I ought to be consoled; I am rich.”
tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh instructions?
“‘It was, as we said, the fifth of February.
“And your excellency wants something to eat?”
As to D’Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment.
Edmond turned away his head with a sigh.
The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it.
My husband was a great friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dantès.
The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison.
“How?”
“Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose, all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows.
“What!
Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his father’s neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on Morrel’s breast.
Dantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom.
“Swear it.”
“Do not be alarmed, Maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away.
He had not seen Morrel.
“Yes, yes, madame!
“Oh, monsieur, procurator’s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her pursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos, and that she would not send him a denier.”
Chapter XXVII.
The unfortunate woman was exhausted, not by fatigue, but by terror, and when D’Artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, “Kill me, if you please, you shall know nothing!”
Does he think we are going to take him in?
Mousqueton was seasick.
D’Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at once, Athos said:
“And on what occasion?”
“Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.
The count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with every mark of attention.
“What is that?”
“Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne.”
“I said they would skin me,” thought Danglars; but resolving to resist the extortion, he said, “Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?”
“Oh, shut up!” again interposed some of the audience.
“Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman; but I swear to you that this crime shall be her last.”
Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage.
“Forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror I cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become suspicious.”
“What is there more?” said Debray, who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Danglars.
“Was the woman handsome?”
Tomorrow, by twelve o’clock, I shall have the order for your exile, signed, _Buckingham_.
This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of him as your accomplice.”
“Yes.”
“If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.”
“And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?”
“I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the duke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him—but upon one condition, sire.”
“I swear to you, on my honor,” said he, “to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M. d’Épinay.”
Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men.
A servant entered, summoned by Albert’s ring of the bell.
The king went straight to him.
He swam on still, and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness.
As for Franz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the priming, and waited quietly.
“Troops?”
“I am a prisoner, then?”
“The man who lives to see shall see.”
“And if you fail?”
40122m
That letter you have received, and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse—”
Imprisonment, menaces, ill treatment—she has suffered everything.
What do you wish to say about it?”
Nevertheless, one thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one.
“To know what?”
It will be even more difficult to descend.”
“True,” said Andrea.
“As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.”
“Then you will be besieged.”
Oh, if I were only there to help him!”
Each examined the other with great attention, while exchanging the customary compliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of beauty.
“Without a doubt.”
“Why?” asked Franz.
You understand, my dear girl,” continued D’Artagnan, “she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in.”
“You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,” said Athos, full of rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day.
You know he has estates—Porthos?”
When the police is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a sneaking air, that the track is lost.”
It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room, without either reading or praying.
The guard had, in fact, touched the cardinal in the tenderest point.
“Then you hope?” said d’Avrigny, with surprise.
“My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there.”
D’Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that happened, stood, with crossed arms, before the Musketeer and Mme.
Hold!
Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe.
“Then you will dispute the more.”
But you sent for me, my dear child.
He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow.
Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes, which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid; then she carefully rinsed the glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table.
And these judges, I warn you, will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike.”
“No.”
From time to time a dull sound was heard, like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea; but nothing clear, nothing distinct, nothing intelligible; it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake.
“Leap, coward!” cried Raoul, swimming on; then addressing the traveler, who was struggling twenty yards in front of him: “Courage, sir!” said he, “courage!
“No, sir,” said the honest servant, “it was Monsieur Aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses.”
See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is well-behaved!”
This morning I awoke at six o’clock.
Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them.
This awakening you have given me; allow me, then, to enjoy it at my ease,” and taking her hand, she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside.
“Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place.
“Hey?” said the cardinal, opening the door.
“An illustrious person sends you; an illustrious person awaits you.
While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent.
“No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel, who was holding his breath with emotion.
In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
Is it broken off?”
0145m
Now, after the oath I have just taken, and which I will keep, madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!”
So much the worse, so much the worse—_diavolo!_ as they say in my country.”
All crossed themselves.
At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal, and in a second he was on his feet again.
Let us return to your apartment.
Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your room; do not disturb yourself—do not disturb yourself!”
Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription requested.
This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse.
“But, sir,” answered the steward, “do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon?”
I returned to the seminary.
“I recognized it on your finger.”
“Oh!
“Well, my dear Aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those three horses is yours.”
“Yes.”
But since the end of the month M. Morrel had passed many an anxious hour.
Scarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet-de-chambre called out:
Begone, then!”
“And you have no way to get news of them?
The weapon, as we have already stated, was plunged into the body to the hilt, and as the surgeon, taking it by the end, drew it forth, the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful.
He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast, and without uttering a word he gave her the letter.
As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else.
“What a confounded long time this first act lasts.
“Hush!” said Milady; “let us not, even here, speak thus of him.
“But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room?”
D’Artagnan started off for Saint Germain, followed by Porthos.
Then he added aloud, “Yes, sir, I am hungry—very hungry.”
“Listen,” replied Felton, in a low voice.
“I ought to ask your majesty’s pardon, but I wished to receive your commands from your own mouth.”
This affair made a great noise.
“Stormed!” suggested Athos.
She tried to go toward the window for air, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her, and she sank into an armchair.
“There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget.”
“I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine; do the same.”
Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning.
He remained listening and gazing.
This man was the executioner.
Morrel, overpowered, turned around in the armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein.
His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their mistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed.
“Oh, the voice of nature,” said Monte Cristo.
An hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the soldiers.
“‘Let him have it—let him have it,’ she said.
30333m
“My lord,” said D’Artagnan, no longer able to contain himself, “allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier d’Herblay, who wishes—as you may have heard—to offer his congratulations to your eminence.”
And you, Aramis, you were going, I think, to visit Madame de Longueville.”
“I give you absolute power, therefore; take as large an escort as you like.”
You are saying to yourself: ‘Fifteen days, twenty days?
“And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.”
At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the money is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner’s brains with a pistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the account.”
“Nevertheless he died of indigestion, in spite of his grace,” said D’Artagnan.
“But, sir,” said Hermine suddenly, “if all this is, as you say, caused by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell me of it?
“Listen to me!
Come!

In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fère, the pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience.
And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère, as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil.
“Well, then, gentlemen,” said the queen, “since it is thus, and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned, this is what is required to be done for me.
He is a young, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of destroying.”
He had, then, in order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips.
“Your Majesty probably refers to God,” said M. de Tréville; “for I know no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.”
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god.
But since you possess that virtue, why the devil don’t you make use of it with respect to her Majesty?
“Ah, true!
Stop, there are a fine body of citizens passing; quite attractive, by Jupiter!
“Speak out, my friend.”
“I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugénie.”
“It is well, madame, I believe your oath.”
Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.
His colleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman.
“No.”
“And how much will that cost me, Monsieur d’Artagnan?”
“It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had disappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet.
“What, still keeping up this silly jest?
“What?” said Monte Cristo.
I live retired in the house of my noble protector, but I do it from choice.
“‘A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.’
You may reckon upon me and so may your friend.” Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile, he re-entered his closet more calmly, for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment.
He flattered himself he should be able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule.
The murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning against the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle.
The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room.
We shall be alone, and can make up our accounts.”
“Moreover, he is but a child,” said Aramis.
In the midst of this seeming hilarity, nevertheless, people’s minds were uneasy.
“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you not?” asked Dantès eagerly.
“Gaspard, Gaspard!” murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs, “mind what you are saying!”
“The fact is, I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror.
“That of Marignan, just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis I., who has broken his.
You had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want, when God worked a miracle in your behalf, sending you, by my hands, a fortune—brilliant, indeed, for you, who had never possessed any.
That means balls, dinners, and lawn parties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember us, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble entertainments.”
“No, madame; if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus, I, at least, remember it.”
We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place Royale.”
I can be useful in one way only—if knowledge of Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here.
Present arms!
“They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired.
“Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at least, not to miss the man.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come.
“I, madame?” said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; “how so?”
Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man.
IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF Chapter XXXV.
The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern.
Before he had spoken a word, the count saw in the next room a veiled woman, who had followed closely after Baptistin, and now, seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table, rushed in.
“And what do you believe?” His voice was stifled by sobs.
Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.
“And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings?”
For the present he had no anxiety.
And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner.”
“I beg your excellency’s pardon,” interposed the steward in a deprecating manner, “for venturing to observe that it is already two o’clock.”
He had given his word not to watch Mme.
“I saw it done.”
“Certainly I do.”
He was a man of execution, this worthy Porthos.
“So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you wished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you would not dare!”
Aramis blushed.
This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess’s box.
‘I bought,’ said he, ‘the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle; whereas, on my honor, Monsieur de Chavigny, though I’ve been here a week, has not ordered so much as a tartlet.’ ‘But,’ I then replied, ‘probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good.’ ‘My pastry not good!
“Bread?
“What are you saying to her?” said Morcerf in an undertone.
How many men, think you, you could collect together to-night?”
“No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you.”
I should myself have recommended the match, had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”
; “for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions.
The opinion of Athos was that D’Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish.
“I have brought her here, sir, and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte, who, till better advice comes, has bathed the foot in cold well-water.”
We shall not interfere with each other—your object is a title; mine, money.
There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain about a dozen.
“What’s the matter with this head?” said D’Artagnan, raising the battered hat.
“And do you always forget your eyes when you run?” asked Porthos.
Milady sprang out of bed.
“Your majesty,” answered Mazarin, “desires me to do only what I was going to ask you to let me do.
He visited his own dungeon.
Now, chevalier,” he added, turning to Aramis, “let us go.
The man in the mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.
Monte Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured:
Let us dispense with useless words.
and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts.”
I tell you I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!” cried the unfortunate woman.
“Here,” said he, “is the price of the execution, that it may be plain we act as judges.”
my dear Athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks.”
Albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage.
Monsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee plainly that if we don’t kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation.
“Without doubt.”
“You have promised him that I shall live?”
my lord bishop,” he cried, seizing Juxon’s hands, “where is Providence?
“Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?” demanded the notary, thinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene.
“I mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison with you.”
On the Eve of Battle.
I shall wait for you here till seven.”
“No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.”
and how he terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him!
Good God!
Comminges bowed, and returned to Athos, who was awaiting with apparent calmness, but with real anxiety, the result of the interview.
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.
“No, monsieur,” returned Monte Cristo “upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends.
“Straw!” they all cried out, “straw!
Mazarin breathed again.
This voice was that of Athos, who, standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind, thus assailed the public accuser.
“Besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us,” said Porthos, “and that will be a pity.
“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!”
“I wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,” stammered the _soubrette_.
He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, who, after becoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII.
“I should think so, indeed—almost as high as a tower.”
“Yes, sire.”
“Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts.
help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”
“The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril,” interrupted the queen, with a sad smile, “and I ask no more for my husband than has been done for me; you see that we are very humble monarchs, sir.”
Then the pope and Cæsar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner.
The porter was in attendance; he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count’s approach.
ah, me!
Morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening.
“Let us go,” repeated D’Artagnan.
“For what purpose?”
The youth’s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls, forming a sort of dark frame around his face; such was the fashion of the day.
Pay and eat.”
You know how difficult it is to discover the truth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes Louis XIII.
“‘In the first place,’ said he, ‘I wish my lackey placed with me, fully armed.’ We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to understand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire.
Notwithstanding all the pains he took, D’Artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new-made friends.
Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then terrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God.
20189m
They had not seen him for two days.
“Let us try what we can do, then,” said the notary.
“Yes, that is true,” said she, “and I will confess to your Majesty that my husband—”
“That is true, that is true, my child,” said the queen, “you are right.”
Call for help!”
“And now, gentlemen, that’s well,” continued the cardinal.
If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my sergeant will blow your brains out.
Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
“Order of the king, I tell you.
The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
I will allow you to make me hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above all, I forbid you to ruin me.”
“Athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so skillfully.”
“Was an accomplice of the duke’s and escaped along with him.”
“I believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty, sire.”
They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles, Julie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features betraying the utmost consternation.
“What time is it, then?”
He was received in triumph, as if he came from conquering an enemy and not Frenchmen.
You are in a hurry, captain!”
“The Morcerfs!—Stay, my dear count,” said Danglars; “you are a man of the world, are you not?”
“Ah, it is Jacopo,” she said, “the captain of the yacht;” and she beckoned him towards them.
“Someone must be sent to the duke.”
At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer.
“It appears to me,” said D’Artagnan, with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, “that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore.”
It might alienate my protector.
You start for Paris?
“I imagine anyone may write to Yanina.”
“ARAMIS.”
“No mysteries, no cloak to hide one’s self in, no cunning policy here; people laugh outright, they weep for joy here.
If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by extreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape.
She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon.
D’Artagnan smiled.
He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges—the clock gave its warning to strike eleven—the door of his study opened.
Eight o’clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the same motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep.
Name to me such of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must bring.”
The carriage entered by the Porta del Popolo, turned to the left, and stopped at the Hôtel d’Espagne.
“Oh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.”
The little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three feet high.
Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice?
One of the culprits will be _mazzolato_;3 he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who brought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity.
“Without reckoning,” objected Porthos, “that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham, but would take no heed of us.”
Aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, “Will it be really rendering you a service, D’Artagnan?”
“Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,” said Edward, with his habitual quickness.
“If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have left you there.”
me!
“‘Well, then, you shall have it!’
Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on the bride, by whose side walked Dantès’ father; the whole brought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.
“Don’t laugh, my friend!” cried D’Artagnan; “for heaven’s sake, don’t laugh, for upon my soul, it’s no laughing matter!”
“There are, at least, few that I have not seen,” said the count coldly.
Chapter 37.
“Well?” asked the queen
Dantès seized the handles, and strove to lift the coffer; it was impossible.
This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age.
But D’Artagnan at the same time, being a man of extreme caution, was quite aware what injury he should do himself, if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Athos.
“You are a hero, my friend,” said Mazarin, gazing at the musketeer with admiration.
Peppino made a sign, and the youth hastily removed the fowl.
“But, grandmamma——”
“I wish, after such a scene, to be alone.”
“I have them.”
There was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme.
Valentine had not seen him.
“Your highness had already expressed that wish,” said Bertuccio, “and the horses are ready.
He was a dead man; and on my honor, if I had discovered that it was his son, I should have regretted having killed him.”
M. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid.
I always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of having.
“They are always the same.”
“Milady,” faltered D’Artagnan, and fainted a second time.
“Take this,” said Athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him his own, “and be a good lad.
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time the terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on the preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again.
The darkness lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in the room.
“Then these 1,000 francs——” said Mercédès, shuddering.
“It is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman.” Then all at once, starting, she cried, “My God!
“And at his return you will send him to me.
“’Tis he!” murmured Winter, his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side.
For the rest, as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were still at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.
“How so?”
If my mother could know of this attention on your part—and I will venture to tell her—I am sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father will be equally angry.” The count laughed.
“At their ball; it was apparent enough.
“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.
“Come in,” said the officer.
“Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.”
We shall see better what is going on.”
The poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.”
“Oh, enough of this,—enough of this,” he cried; “let me save the last.” On entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb.
“Pardieu!
“Will your majesty pardon me,” said Planchet, “but is it really the king who is lying there?”
The queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air of supreme hauteur, said, “What do you desire, monsieur, and with what object do you present yourself here?”
Grant me this poor wretch’s life.
“But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?” asked Milady.
Do you know?”
“Enter, my sister,” said the queen.
“Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are,” said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo.
The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and sofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment.
“_She!_ What she?” asked D’Artagnan.
“What think you, Danglars,” said one of the party, turning towards him, “of this event?”
“I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina?”
Seven o’clock had just struck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given him, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the door, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried away, as if ashamed of its employment.
“Yes, Noirtier.”
“We were having a confidential conversation,” returned Valentine; “she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and I, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying M. d’Épinay.”
It is he who has raised all this revolt.”
Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count’s pallor, which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting.
Athos, after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead, let fall the corpse and said:
We even have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.
“My lord, perhaps they are not in Paris.
The two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship existed between them, there was at least esteem.
Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week.
“Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.”
“It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona.

All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct.’
“I will come again at that time,” replied the visitor, who then retired.
You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune, you who are sent to me by Henrietta; whatever news you bring, speak out.”
“So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen.”
My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed—that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this moment—and I sent my cutter to meet you.
“One instant, my dear friend,” replied the abbé; “it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what use I intend making of my strength.
About eleven o’clock in the morning they perceived Amiens, and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.
Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with Eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the Germans are so fond.
See, here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon M. Lafitte.
He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.
Valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which appeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with the cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.
A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads.
“No, no—oh, no!”
“I hope it does not exceed—” She stopped; speech failed her.
“Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.”
The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for the address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly, then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of Spain, he read it rapidly.
Madame de Saint-Méran
So saying, he threw his hat on the ground, pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace.
“Today?”
you can ride, you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people.
“What would you have me do?” said Fernand.
They are worth about fifty thousand pounds.
“Is it possible?” exclaimed the countess; “is he here in Paris?”
A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.
But would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope?”
“Oh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger, and which I had observed yesterday.”
“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.
Precautions.
Was he the man that stabbed you?”
“Take this,” he said with a sigh, “’tis merely for your journey.”
There’s no second Constance in the world.”
“The Comte de la Fere!” he cried in his turn.
“Pray do so.”
“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.
Smuggling is a profitable trade, when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the past.
“Valentine de Villefort.”
come down!”
“Do not be angry, we can try it.” Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut.
However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator’s wife.
“Yes, madame,” said D’Artagnan; “but get in fearlessly, for I myself will drive you.”
Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity.
“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a garrison, turnkeys, and good thick walls.
“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service.
He was, however, forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed.
“How many people,” thought he, “and not one true friend.”
“Now,” said he, “that suffices—begone!”
“Go, go!” exclaimed Dantès.
The wounded man heaved a sigh.
“Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry?”
“Because it is taking people unawares.”
But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated.
Poor Concino Concini!
Edmond opened his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe pains in his loins.
“No; a Venetian.”
“No; for I put it in execution that very minute.”
I was not aware that you were so intimate with her.”
The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue.
Number 34 and Number 27
“Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.”
Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were?”
But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked, the darkness in which our illusions are lost, the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up.
It was indeed Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day.
sir, you know well I would risk my life for you.”
She was seated.
“Do you not perceive that I know all—your abduction from the little house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their useless inquiries up to this moment?
The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort.
“It is, nevertheless, the only one we can give.”
“Well?” said D’Artagnan, at last.
“What?” cried Franz, “was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants?”
“Pass on before me, I beg of you.”
“Why does he take my comb?”
“Have you ever heard of him?”
The four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of Porthos, tranquillity; that of D’Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis, uneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.
“Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah, well; he would care very little about it, I think.”
“Shall I help you, madame?” asked Athos.
Thus, the future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage, and Morrel, seeing them pass, became uneasy.
“Willingly.
“But the secret!” said D’Artagnan.
“But, my dear count,” said Albert, “we shall abuse your kindness.”
As long as it was dark they remained silent; in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity, and apprehended ambushes on every side.
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.
“Indeed!” exclaimed the duke, who from time to time looked at the clock, the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness.
“Saved!” mechanically repeated the young gentleman, releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into Raoul’s arms; Raoul was but ten yards from the shore; there he bore the fainting man, and laying him down upon the grass, unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet.
“Where?” asked Maximilian.
“Really?
“Is this your counsel also, Winter?” inquired the king.
Can it be, can it possibly be, the ‘Illustrious Coxcomb, Mazarin de Piscina,’ hey?”
“I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”
No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!”
Buckingham had returned to London; Mme.
“There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night, but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil, to that you went to, you know.”
It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm.
“Then you abandon all hope of escape?”
As to D’Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.
This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love you.
“How so?”
No one had entered the house since I had left it.
Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape, except in your dreams.”
However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle.
“But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us?” asked Aramis.
20107m
“As to my health, since it has stood five years of prison, with Monsieur de Chavigny to boot, ’tis excellent!
“I?”
“We?
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques.
Does this oath satisfy you?”
If we were surprised, if it were known that we met thus, we should have no further resource.”
By degrees, the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them, and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel.
At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for Porthos.
The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door; no one ventured to speak, for fear of disturbing him.
At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls.
“Your majesty, on your side,” said D’Artagnan, “is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always been.”
“But that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,” replied Athos.
“I am glad to be reassured on that point.
“We have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty dear, were it only from self-love.”
“I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine.”
“That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food to eat, and rarely anything to drink.”
Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat down to table.
“Well, go and talk with the boy,” said D’Artagnan, “and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead.”
There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation.
“I give you my oath that I will not.”
He turned and saw Julie.
These two gentlemen shall decide between us; but, first, I will state the case to them.
“Silence, sir!
You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather than speak.”
D’Artagnan took his hand.
Wait till he is set out and then, marry, come up, ask, and find out.
“My friend, since I killed Chatillon, adored of the ladies of Saint Germain, I am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly.
“To me?” cried Danglars.
The world is not wanting in attractions.
Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.
That’s the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of mine.
In the antechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to say, those who were called.
can he have—” and she stopped.
It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our friend D’Artagnan formed a part.
“Do so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.”
He had just expired, with clenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in the sweat of death.
I am fond of grass and shade,” said Monte Cristo.
You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to God’s anger—well, who says your supposition is not reality?
D’Artagnan, that man of iron, who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only, had struck him with admiration.
This voice was that of my father.
“No quarter!” cried a voice in French, answering to that of Winter, which made them tremble.
As long as your brother was with me he kept me up; but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself, either to me or to your father.
where are you?
“Bring here immediately the king’s attorney, M. de Villefort, who lives in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
There I will indicate to you the best place and time.”
“I don’t understand you, Bazin; nor can I see how I can be a stumbling-block in the way of your salvation,” said D’Artagnan.
Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who, almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father.
Well, I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said, ‘Why do you ask me that?’ and looked so strangely at me.”
It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon, as his house came first; but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne, to see Raoul.
Mordaunt,” said the cardinal, raising his voice, as if to arouse the dreamer, “my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one; go, therefore, and await it at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and promise me to set out to-morrow morning.”
Grimaud nodded.
The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantès’ fate would be decided.
And Kitty, who had not let go the hand of D’Artagnan, led him up a little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen steps, opened a door.
“That is well; but where and how shall I see you again?”
“Thanks, madame!” said Porthos, “but I don’t like to abuse your kindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!”
I shall meet them there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview?
“Myself excepted,” and again Mazarin smiled; “for you perceive that I have left off mine and put on yours.”
He quietly regained his seat, and wrote under the other lines:
The sportsman instantly changed his direction, and ran quickly towards them.
You have some in the house, have you not?”
“Now it is time that the malady should be over,” said she; “let me rise, and obtain some success this very day.
“Well; what of the postscript?”
“Really?
A circle was immediately formed around the door.
Milady breathed again.
D’Artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife, so that she might not be anxious about him, but Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was, while he, Planchet, remembering her incontinence of tongue, would die of anxiety if she did know.
“And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?”
He entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions.
Where was I then?
Between people like us threats are out of place, everything should be amicably arranged.
At ten o’clock Milady began to appear restless.
“The crime which I have committed, my lord, has no call upon human justice, and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently, as you have just done.”
Employ them, if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind.”
In the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with the musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking.
Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding place, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye could pierce the interior of Aramis’s room.
“Me?” The former sign was repeated.
Who can answer for that?
HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT
“My father, my father!” cried the young man, “why should you not live?”
The other bowed respectfully, and offered his arm to assist the count in descending.
Chapter 71.
“No,” said Mazarin; “although, perhaps, that counsel is as good as any other.”
“Tomorrow.”
By Aramis is meant Simara, which is the name of a demon.
“Yes; you are now on the right path,” said the count, crossing his arms over his broad chest; “search—search!”
He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as, during three years that he had travelled all over Italy, a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion.
“The Abbé Faria.”
“And now, my dear friend,” said Faria, “sole consolation of my wretched existence,—you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,—at the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve.
Franz congratulated Albert, who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited.
_Au revoir_, Albert.
“That is somewhat difficult, my lord,” said Rochefort, with a smile.
Cloud; but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château, reached a sort of retired lane, and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named.
To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense.
“Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.
“The proofs?” said Benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”
“And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned?” asked Athos.
A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in the salon.
“Indeed?”
But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?”
“That is to say, I visit an Englishwoman—the one I named.”
Now, especially, did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was feeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take.
“How so?”
“But, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a comfort.”
Deuce take it!
“In what?”
“And I have come at once to see you.”
At the same hour as on the preceding evening, D’Artagnan retired.
“Thank you,” she said.
Madame, we are yours, body and soul.”
He used to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat.
A handkerchief, tied at the four corners, is to be the signal.”
“Excuse you for what?
Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned of his coming, went into the other chamber.
Good-morning, Emmanuel; you will come with me then, Maximilian?”
“Adieu, Raoul,” said the count; “adieu, my dearest boy!”
If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.”
“What an awakening for the Parisians!” said the queen, radiant.
I neither know nor care.
Immediately a brilliant light from the next room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep.
Then my friends and I took her, tried her, and condemned her.”
That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but one person, has visited this justice on him alone.”
“Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest.
I will send for M. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate, and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate, where we will rejoin them in a week.”
And after pressing the hand of Athos, D’Artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward, so that he had only to plunge into the water, which was already up to his waist.
The cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon of my acquaintance.”
She bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth.
“I confess he asked me none.”
I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack.”
“Do not do so, reverend sir.”
“Here’s half a pistole.
“And who is this Colonel Bridge?” asked Aramis, “and how does he go to work to weed the parliament?”
A small door, close to the lodge of the _concierge_, gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot.
“You are right,” said Morrel, calmly.
“Here!” cried the steward, “here!” whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building.
“My dear Raoul, learn, once for all, that that is a question which is never asked.
“In April you went to dine at the minister’s.
You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude.
And then, besides, the useless blood!
Everyone drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room.
In fact, he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words, to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign.
“Then I forgive you,” said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing to the light.
“Oh!
He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat by him.
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister.
her temper was uncertain, but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes.”
Baptistin re-entered with glasses, wine, and biscuits.
Then, rising, he went out, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he asked:
I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table.
“Unhappy father,” said Monte Cristo.
The queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her.
Andrea pricked up his ears.
No, I would rather die.”
“I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni.”
“Yes, yes, that was her name; and now absolve me, for I am dying.”
“I cannot speak Latin,” responded the marquise.
Danglars turned very red.
“The vessel was very old to risk that,” said the Englishman.
He went up to him, but, to his extreme astonishment, the stranger first addressed him.
“‘And what have you done to aspire to this honor?’ demanded the lieutenant.
“Oh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of.”
What granted me?—scarcely more.
I did hope (man is a poor wretched creature), I did hope.
“Yes, and Mercédès!
“And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.”
He had reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden.
“Eight!” repeated Bertuccio.
Look at that wall—without a single window—which tells you fine things about Mazarin’s gratitude!”
Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment.
“As to the cavalier in the brown cloak——”
Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but he would see.
Grimaud sprang up.
“I know it,” said Athos, coolly, “since here it is.”
Dantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever.
Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle.
“Well, what is there surprising in that?
“It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he referred to King Mithridates,” continued the count, “and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him, for your son is really advanced for his years.”
He reflected for a second and then descended the stairs.
Her hôtel was remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit, or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.
“He left four days ago,” said D’Artagnan.
“And that valor would shrink from no undertaking, according to what I see.”
Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself.
They then dressed themselves.
“Really, did they?” said D’Artagnan.
“Then you know that I did not leave him?”
“If we say one hundred pistoles for the three——”
Welcome to ye.”
“I will assist you with all my heart, monseigneur; be assured of that.”
“No, the son’s.”
“Good morning, Benedetto,” said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.
“Yes, sir, that is the reason,” said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders.
These exploits had gained Luigi considerable reputation.
“My lord, I am twenty-three years of age; but your eminence is mistaken in saying that I am young.
M. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the following evening he received these details:
“I will not irritate him,” thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting,—having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident,—he read:
“‘Yes.’
Athos was meditating; Porthos was twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.
“And for pirates,” returned Gaetano, repeating Franz’s words.
The idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbé’s dead body.

“Are they capable of attempting violence?”
I hate him!

The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his Eminence.
“Sir,—The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at Toulon.
“Excellent; there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux.”
“Yes,” said Maximilian, “I recollect the project, of which I highly approved.”
The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance; he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old.
“And I also,” said Morrel thoughtfully, “have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penelon.”
See him there, cold as marble and proud like his father.
Milady had told the truth—her head was confused, for her ill-arranged plans clashed one another like chaos.

Athos shook his head.
The safety of the horseman, you know, depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse.”
“Where is he, then?”
As to King Charles, the question must be viewed differently; in receiving and aiding him, France will censure the acts of the English nation, and thus so essentially harm England, and especially the well-being of the government, that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities.”
“I say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that without resistance.
“Of the—” D’Artagnan checked himself.
He held some papers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned completely up to the chin.
“I cover mine,” said D’Artagnan.
“There,” said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haydée, whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian, perceived his pale features close to Morcerf’s face.
“When you say invisible,” interrupted Albert, “it is only to keep up the mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains?”
“Well, but then,” continued Athos, speaking half to himself, “if I kill you, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.”
Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all seven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to the owner.”
The peasants were in great commotion.
The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano, accompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves, and performed admirably.

You will take it to the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.”
The executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair.
“I have,” replied D’Artagnan.
So, then, they have paid my ransom?”
“Yes,” said Debray, “but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome.”
“No, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for the napkins.”
“What do you think of that interrogator?” asked Aramis.

Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him.

The first three remained constantly in a small waiting-room, ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell, or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave, who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistress’s wishes to the three other waiting-women; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen.
Zounds!
“Silence!
Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay.
So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive.” This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.
“Don’t worry, dear grandpapa,” said she, endeavoring to smile; “it is nothing—it is nothing; I was giddy, that is all.”
Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement.

“Ah,” said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left, “what are you doing there?
Peppino Chapter 115.
“And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken.
“Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return.”
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “what Porthos says is full of sense.”
I have two things to postpone.”
“You at last?” cried D’Artagnan.

Aramis hesitated.
The queen smiled, but instead of answering:
The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.

The governor, of course, thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner.
But that which astonished him most was that the cardinal, so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in England, had not succeeded in arresting him on the road.

“The queen became exceedingly red, and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs, she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired.”
D’Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly.
“It will be one valiant sword the less, but there will remain still three, without reckoning my own; now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies, to be at his side in battle, to aid him with counsel, to escort him in flight, are sufficient, not to make the king a conqueror, but to save him if conquered; and whatever Mazarin may say, once on the shores of France your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm.”
Do you talk of your honor?
“Absolutely the same.”
How many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme.
“I can answer only for myself,” said Mazarin.

Morrel saw it was useless to say more, and refrained.
I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her.
If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”
I have two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one who gave me being, and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me.
“I shall expect you,” returned Morrel; “and I will pay you—or I shall be dead.” These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them.
Father and Son
“Do as you like,” said Raoul, who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society, who, when there were robbers on the highroads, were connected with them, and who, since highwaymen no longer exist, have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place.

Porthos foresaw that if D’Artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed.
But when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine, the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict abstinence—while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done—D’Artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Tréville, it had disappeared.
no.
“Three weeks!” cried Albert; “they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor.”
Only remember this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear (for you will look and you will listen, I am quite sure, however we may threaten you), you are lost.’ At these words he threw me a crown, which I picked up, and he took the ladder.
“Yes, but never with the same advantages,” said D’Artagnan, in a tone of raillery; “for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight.”
So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame Danglars’ box.
He therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.
“The last.”
He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife:

I could not ride behind.
“Ah, well,” exclaimed Château-Renaud, who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend, “you young people are never satisfied; why, what would you have more?
“I did.”
Provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I send Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby intimating that such was his wish.
‘Oh, my mother, it was you who said, “You were free, you had a beloved father, you were destined to be almost a queen.
All his emotion then burst forth; he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished.
“One has never the last word with such a man.
So the duke had more than enough to think about; accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis; he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game.

“You have given me all you can give me, and from to-day your debt is paid.”
“Against whom?”

“De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard, who, he said, had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots.
Franz fell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man.
“Gentlemen,” said Aramis, “the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves money the best.”
He had assigned himself the task of saving a man’s life that day; chance caused that man to be myself.
He laid every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to accomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers, Dantès remained a prisoner.
Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,—an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.
“None whatever.
“Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me, myself, seeing that I am my father’s son, is it not, Tréville?

Do you wish a step, or some place in the government?”
“I will accompany you a portion of the way,” said Athos.
“Yes.”
when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense, or of every country squire in the kingdom.”
“Yes, yes,” murmured Cromwell; “the French fight well; and if my glass was good and I mistake not, they were foremost in the fight.”
“He must be a vampire.”
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters’ steeds.
The young girl looked at Morrel.
“Sire,” said D’Artagnan, “will your majesty permit me to ask you a question?”
“You are Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
“I see spots of blood on the ground.” And he set off to follow the two friends.
“My friend,” said Aramis, “take care; our safety lies in our obscurity.

“Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.”
“Yes, indeed.
Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already full.
“What can we do?” said D’Artagnan; “we must return to Paris.”
He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit him.
Athos smiled sadly, for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De Winter.
“But,” said Athos, “who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king?”

Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment—for of all this I have the proofs?”
“Really?
“On whom, then!—on me?”
A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis.

“My dear,” said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room, “perhaps you exaggerate the evil.”
“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”
M. de Morcerf approached her.
Besides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed early in the quarter of the Luxembourg.
He turned toward the wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said, “Come, I will not abandon you thus.
“Indeed.”
good-day, dear friend!” replied D’Artagnan.
“‘Woman is fickle.’ said Francis I.; ‘woman is like a wave of the sea,’ said Shakespeare; both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman’s nature well.”
Château-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre.
The soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.
“Yes,” said M. d’Avrigny, with an imposing calmness, “but I think it is now time to act.
“Because, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.”
It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled.
It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled.
“Ah, Monsieur Hypocrite, I understand how you study theology.”
Bonacieux became livid; a fearful agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aramis.
“And now why are you here?”
We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always come back to _écarté_—it is not only a game, it is a _hors-d’œuvre_!
Then I confess to you that I have eaten nothing since ten o’clock this morning, and I am devilish hungry.”
“I shall get them all in time.”
Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had before done in the Rue Vaugirard.
It struck ten.
One hour’s rapid progress, however, sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man’s bright anticipations; and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom—a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence—seemed to Raoul to gild not only Heaven and earth, but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future.
It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.
“Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?”
“For a stranger who does not know Paris,” said Athos, “and to whom the viscount will show the way.”
The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty.
“Ah, his name?
Poverty overtook you.
You are going now to pay your court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than before.”
Then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant, remounted the steps, went into the cathedral, there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray.
“We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is sometimes devouring.”
“The day has been unfortunate, but it is not your fault, thank God!
“To the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small glass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.”
Has not your excellency heard that the French _chargé d’affaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri?”
Danglars left?
We were all so happy in the Chateau de Pierrefonds!”

We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk.
D’Artagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal.
“Admirable!” replied the young men in chorus.
“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and I have noticed that——”
“And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here?”
“Be satisfied, monsieur,” said Planchet, “you shall see if confidence can be placed in me.”
Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice.
Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?”
“Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, “who will attend you in your campaigns?”
Impossible!”
Master Friquet, the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him, had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket.
“Calumnies, did you say, sir?” cried Morcerf, turning livid with rage.
d’Artagnan has abducted my wife!
“Pooh!
And Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by D’Artagnan.
“Ah, the devil, no,” cried Albert; “I came to Rome to see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.”
“That gentleman is the Abbé d’Herblay,” replied he.
A groan, stifled by the grasp of Porthos, was all the reply of poor Blaisois, for the giant, taking him neck and heels, plunged him into the water headforemost, pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank.
“Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,” said the major with a smile and a shake of the head.
“Rise!” said he.
“Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude.”
“Is not death in my house?”
“Or of wisdom, my dear baron—or of wisdom,” said Louis XVIII., laughing; “the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean—see Plutarch’s life of Scipio Africanus.”
You will make some desirable acquaintances; and from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are getting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.”
Villefort, becoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt.
They explained what had occurred that evening.
You have told me yourself, madame, that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in it—for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a presentiment that I should shortly die.” And the duke smiled, with a smile at once sad and charming.
All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse, and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone.
The Catalans
Haydée’s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the Dionysian festivals.—Ed.
“Undoubtedly I know it, but it is a mystery.”
“Fie, madame, fie!” said Porthos, as if disgusted.
“You will ask for the host, and will repeat to him the word ‘Forward!’”
“In truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,” said the gentleman, pressing the Gascon’s hand with an affection almost paternal; “and God grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not leave a terrible trace in it!” And Athos bowed to D’Artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts.
He did not wait long, for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume.
“Well, well,” said the cardinal, “I don’t wish you any ill; but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends.
I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name, my social position, and my merit.”

One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon.
No, I am lost; do not be lost with me.
“Oh, it concerns you very closely, my uncle, I am sure, and you will soon be of my opinion,” added he, with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed.
The queen reflected for a moment and then, seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer:
And Mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.
Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law, preparations on both sides were commenced—by the queen, to attack Paris, by the citizens, to defend it.
“The king himself.”
He immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp, with the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for their agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired, having had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.
“Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?” said Valentine, addressing Noirtier.
This precaution taken, they went to the theatre, and installed themselves in the count’s box.
Franz paused for a moment.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.

“Here it is,” answered the other.
He had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk, and his head leaning on his hand.
“Be satisfied with being a plain, straightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most advantages.”
Please follow me,” and he went on before, followed by Athos and Aramis.
He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on.
The old man signified that he recollected him.
“You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter come round again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”
“Yes, for you, my lord, but not for the queen; you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking.”
“Oh, my God!”
“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was employed, and at this very minute——”
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed.
As long as the procurator’s wife could follow him with her eyes, she waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself.
“How long have you been here?”
As to Haydée, these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched.

“‘I have already told you—avenge him.’
“But still there are some signals only addressed to you.”
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring.
“It is the cardinal.”
“It is a casket of wood bound with iron,” thought he.
“Yes,” said Porthos, “’twill be at least a little change from beer.”
In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.
The young and high-spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath.
“What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?” said Porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago.

“I say that she was my mother.”

I saw a white figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses, I heard my glass removed—the same which is there now on the table.”

Planchet, who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade, declared that he would follow D’Artagnan even to the end of the world, either by the road to the right or by that to the left; only he begged his former master to set out in the evening, for greater security to himself.
“Well, let us sleep at Noyon,” said Raoul.
The four old Friends prepare to meet again.
“Excuse my little subterfuge,” said the countess, in reply to her companion’s half-reproachful observation on the subject; “but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be alone, that I might compose my startled mind.”
“What the devil!” said the host to himself.
D’Artagnan saluted, went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarin’s flattering promises, which gave Porthos an indescribable happiness.
“Your fingers are stained with ink.”

Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him reply.
His complexion was pale, not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty, but of a bilious, yellow hue; his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head, and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression.

Athos, without saying anything, emptied his pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold chains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings.
The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper.
Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars’ rage, suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his leave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed, leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.

If you plunge a dagger into your flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the least shock disorders,—then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price.”
“No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him.

“You expected my son would be a coward?” cried the count.
Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain, and at nine o’clock in the morning, having a fair wind, our Frenchmen set foot on their native land.

“One day, when Benedetto was about five or six, our neighbor Wasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never locked up his purse or his valuables—for, as your excellency knows, there are no thieves in Corsica—complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money, but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement.

“I was within two paces of you, monsieur,” replied the procurator’s wife; “but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.”
When the patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and every sail full with the breeze.

“Yes, there is the sky; here is the sea!
“Just remember what they said.
I have sent for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?”
During this time Porthos played close.
In England the post was well served.
He was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love.
“Who prepared it?”

A captain is nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family.
“When shall I strike?”
“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love.

Besides, the Scriptures say, ‘Confess yourselves to one another,’ and I confess to you, D’Artagnan.”

But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence; Laporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders of Charles I., arrived, and was the bearer of the duke’s dying gift to the queen.
“That is admirable!” said Eugénie with sovereign contempt, smoothing her gloves out one upon the other.
At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou, a man travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed the little town of Aquapendente.
These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; Dantès rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before, and pushed his bed back against the wall.
I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it should be so.
“Yet I must know his name.”
Suddenly the door opened, an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered, followed by two guards, to whom the king waved an imperious gesture.

“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be delighted.”
And you, Grimaud,” he said to his companion, who had just come in after his round with D’Artagnan, “are you thirsty?”

The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in so doing laid bare her shoulder.
“Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”
He turned away and went off to his post, whistling a tune then popular among the party called the “Fronde,” whilst Mazarin returned, in a pensive mood, toward the Palais Royal.
Unfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards him; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not friends.

“Are you very anxious to know, countess?” asked Albert.
“Pah!
Monte Cristo on the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus possessed the advantage.
“On no pretense leave the door, for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant, although I, during his absence, watched in his place.”
The guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Neuf.
“They will have nothing to do, then at this end?” said Mordaunt.

However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt.
“My boy,” said Caderousse sententiously, “one can talk while eating.
“Yes, and I will tell you.

M. de Tréville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Tréville hastened to report himself at the Louvre.
As for Porthos’s coat, a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two.
“Agreed.”
“Where do you suffer?” asked the doctor.
Bradshaw waited, and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence.

The damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it off—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in two years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.
“Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.”
You have credit with your landlord, then?” asked Porthos.
“So it was with Monsieur d’Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel?”
“It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,” said the count, “and that not only do you forget people’s faces, but also the conditions you make with them.”
“Dead,—dead!” groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man.
If I am not saved I shall be avenged.”
I have just made M. de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be returned.
“My orders?” asked Grimaud.
You, also, stand aside,” he said to the masked man.
“Quite so,” replied the lieutenant.
A week passed by.
He certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him.
Then obeying the orders given him by Athos, he headed the small procession, bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other, until it reached De Winter’s inn, when pounding on the portal with his fist, he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word.
“Eight men remain constantly in his room.”
Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?”
“Yes, to escort him into the capital.
“Athos is near you,” said D’Artagnan; “warn him as I have warned you.”
“I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,” said Monte Cristo; “but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to you.”

“The _real_ reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.”
On approaching the house, he perceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.

Grimaud’s agitation, his pallor, the sweat which covered his face, the dust which soiled his clothes, all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news.
It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dantès.
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations, “dost thou know where Athos is?”
“What are they?”
“I have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him, and I pray you to do so also.
“Barrois will open the door for you,” said Valentine, addressing Morrel.
“Will all Paris be there?”

“And I have none, either,” said the queen.
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes; and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship.
I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.”
The young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again apologizing, left by another door.
I recollect.”
Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities were resumed.
“Very well,” replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.
Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit.
“It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?”
At each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the laughter, the door-keeper’s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department, respected in the army, or illustrious in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups.
“Shall you go, then, Albert?” asked Franz.
And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau—”
“I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody.”

And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.
I wish to be sure of my revenge.
Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, who, since the death of his father, Henri de Bourbon, was called, in accordance with the custom of that period, Monsieur le Prince, was a young man, not more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, with the eye of an eagle—agl’ occhi grifani, as Dante says—aquiline nose, long, waving hair, of medium height, well formed, possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier—that is to say, the rapid glance, quick decision, fabulous courage.
“The very same.
“Well,” said the president, seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent, “so be it.
In fact, the young man appeared at the gate, covered with dust, entered the courtyard, leaped from his horse, which he consigned to the charge of a groom, and then went to greet the count and D’Artagnan.

Mercédès started; she noticed that the young man did not say “my father.”
“I will tell you, my lord, on the day when you are willing to hear my confession.”
It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it was there Mercédès dwelt.

“The idea of asking how I hear the news,” he said.
“This reassures me more than all the royal signatures,” thought D’Artagnan.

Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were eating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal.

“But who are those others?
“And you did not fire on him?”
This time, however, his address, although polite, was cooler than usual.
“Then, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much value.”
Scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously, that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation.
“Undoubtedly, madame,” said D’Artagnan, taking the document and bowing, “this is a noble reward; but everything in the world is unstable, and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to-morrow.”
Lucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as Debray, and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room.
One window was lighted.
“Well, what did he say then?”
These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy.”
Patrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in relations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one who came in his name.
“And now, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan, “you know that it is not good for any of us to be here.
Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert, then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation.
I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my senses.
Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.”
Two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place and took all the papers.
“I accuse no one, sir,” said Danglars; “I relate, and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you.”
But tell me——”
“Take it,” said she, “and be accursed!”
Where is Béthune, Athos?”
Make less hubbub and think more deeply.
“We bear witness to this,” said the two Musketeers, with one voice.
“You imagine him capable of writing the letter?”
“Well, madame, in that case, my advice—I know that I am very bold to offer advice to your majesty—my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom.
“My opinion is, that all these old _podestàs_, these ancient _condottieri_,—for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces,—my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions in corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them.”
Have you a heart?
“That’s a good idea, for it isn’t warm.”
“‘Which is to recover a lost and adored son.’”
The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he only knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had requested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books in his library.
Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin, in taking leave, kissed her hand.
Happily, I vanquished death.
“Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.”
So, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most astonishing deeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution.
“No; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.”
“Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,” replied Albert, “but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.”
“Alas,” said Athos, “we depart alone.”
A cold, sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my forehead.
They reached the queen’s apartments, but were compelled to stop in the ante-chamber, since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from England.
If I find you alive on my return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.”
The plate was magnificent, old, and appertaining to the family.
Cardinal Mazarin as King.
“I will tell the coadjutor,” said Bazin.
“Was I pale, Albert?”
Athos rose, and offering him his hand, “Be welcome, my Lord,” said he, “you are one of us.”
“Brute!” said Danglars.
“Come, Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham.”
What do I say?
“I was to take your dispatches, written or verbal, and return by post; and when he shall know what you have done, he will advise what you have to do.”
Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had turned up the ground.
“Oh, yes, with all my soul.”
Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”
12 Rue des Fossoyeurs.
Set out immediately for Paris, and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No.
“Why?—are you so kind—so good—so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot understand, Valentine?”
“I could go in as well as Grimaud,” said Mousqueton, a little piqued.
Yes, you are right; let us go, Porthos, but let us go well armed; were we not to keep the rendezvous, they would declare we were afraid.
“Yes, yes,” repeated Villefort, as he approached his home—“yes, that woman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole survivor, with the exception of the indestructible old man, of the wreck of my house.
Never forget me.”
“Yes, my lord; she came three times, whilst I was a child, to my nurse’s house; I remember the last time she came as well as if it were to-day.”
“Nothing is easier.
Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved her, for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all the virtues of a daughter and wife.
At this name every one looked around, for his was already a very celebrated name.
Poverty was repugnant to her; degradation took away two-thirds of her greatness.
absurd!
“Dear lady,” said Mme.
You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study theology for that purpose.”
At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present situation.
“So you know beforehand you must perish!” said D’Artagnan.
But, doctor, you see me already so grieved—how can I introduce into my house so much scandal, after so much sorrow?
You are setting up an establishment, of course?”
50101m
“What, then?” said Aramis, blushing.
“Why?” asked the young girl with the velvet eyes.
He cherished the thought of the duel, hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds.
I staked Grimaud, the silent Grimaud, divided into ten portions.”
The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the sheets, to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged across the room.
Come, don’t look so angry, and you shall have 4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and Eugénie shall have 2,000.
“Oh, sirs,” said the queen, moved even to tears, “this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope.
“Two hours and a quarter—that is nothing; we are well mounted, are we not, Porthos?”
“By the way,” resumed de Winter, stopping at the threshold of the door, “you must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite.
But, in spite of Albert’s hope, the day passed unmarked by any incident, excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman peasants.
“That poor Planchet!
“What?” asked Porthos.
“Danglars, as well as others.”
He went down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when he remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a “turnout” which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs.
“Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time!
“But those men you speak of,” said Mazarin, smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him, “those men were not devoted to the cardinal, for they contended against him.”
“Let her alone,” said he.
“Well,” said Aramis, “beaten by fate!”
The cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king’s gaming table.
So much the better.
Mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast.
“You were always a merry companion, my dear D’Artagnan,” he said, “and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you.
“If it were as you pretend it is,” said he, “I should be forced, my dear Aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is an intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy.”
“You forget, sir, that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master; and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer, whilst all the time his true vocation was the church.”
“To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to play our respective parts.
D’Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning.
“But allow me to tell you, monsieur,” continued the citizen, “that I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this.”
But did he know what was meant by the terrible word ‘vendetta’?”
“I am a dead man!
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan to himself.
They will kill him, you may be sure of it.”
“You’ll honor and believe him—that’s right.
The novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of the superior; but Milady stopped her.
“I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me.”
If it is a workman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work, in order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it.
Mordaunt, one of my secretaries, will remit this letter of introduction to His Eminence, the Cardinal Mazarin, in Paris.
The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated.
Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement, I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results.
“Not at all,” said Athos, calmly.
“Ah!
And D’Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Villeroy.
Monseigneur will be with him in an hour.”
Milady listened with the greatest attention, and yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her.
“Yes; I showed it to him.”
“You have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.”
“Did you recognize him?”
Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
Many men might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_, if the expression may be used.
“From the appearance of the stone,” he continued, “a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years.
Dead bodies are not kept a year; they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken.
“Well, then, in return for your story,” continued Noirtier, “I will tell you another.”
20177m
“Yes.”
Monsieur is, as usual, led by his favorite; yesterday it was Choisy, to-day it is La Riviere, to-morrow it will be some one else.
On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure of finding Morrel.
In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder.
For that reason I wished to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against everyone, but especially against him.
“‘_Wait and hope_ (Fac et spera)!’”
“Merciful Heavens!”
At the moment of arriving at St. Paul—the spot where such as were condemned at the Bastille were executed—he was near fainting and crossed himself twice.
It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds a man!
Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully.
On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
“Well?”
On the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckingham’s assassination.
That was what he could not know.
“And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?”
“Did he mention my name?”
“And don’t you play, too, when you are on guard?”
If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return, think of me.’
“Yes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support, for I made them by serving your Eminence.”
“Ah, very well, that’s an explanation!” said Caderousse.
“My lord, he has been for three days at the Rue Cassette.”
“Oh, that’s of no consequence just now,” said Mme.
‘I do not see what you have in your hand,’ said Selim.
It appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry.
“To the hotel, to be sure, to get our baggage and horses; and from there, if it please God, to France, where, at least, I understand the architecture of the houses.”
“Send away that fellow, Raoul,” said the Gascon; “for if he’s a coward he will disgrace thee some day.”
He calls himself so.
“In what respect?”
But by some strange play of emotion, in proportion as the proofs that Faria, had not been deceived became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of discouragement stole over him.
Both got into Albert’s _coupé_; and, as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going, he called aloud, “To the Opera.” In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance.
Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to come hither.”
At last he heard the voice of La Ramee.
“But how is it that you know so much of these matters?”
This can’t last,” and he drew another twenty from his pocket.
“Hush,” whispered De Guiche, “these are cavaliers.”
“I did guess it,” replied the major with the greatest possible coolness.
Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine; but his eyes, raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language which, though mute, was not the less expressive.
“Yes.”
“Go on,” said he.
On the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither D’Artagnan had sent for her.
But what is the matter, Albert?
“Lightning,” interrupted Mordaunt.
“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another thing.
“Yes, I understand perfectly,” said D’Artagnan.
“Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!”
The young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a sentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.
“I will not sign this order!
Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen.
You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw.
“Good-day, Monsieur Dulaurier,” replied D’Artagnan.
I hope you will be satisfied with its contents.
Besides, what is required of a young man in Paris?
“Well,” said Albert, with a sigh, “it seems you are determined to marry me.”
“Dear Friend,—I am about to set off with Aramis on important business.
Their number was great.
“You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont, Henrietta!” said the queen.
“We are alone, sir,” said Buckingham; “speak!”
“Good,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.”
I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman crowns—about 24,000 francs.
In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn.
then you must have something on your mind!” said Athos.
He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every way fit for his office.
Once out to sea, you are too good a politician not to understand the rest, Mordaunt.”
“How so?”
The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the gateway of No.
“You are right; it was left on board.”
In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does not exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons, which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.”
“You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.”
“Oh, send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch!”
“Why not?
“Yes, horse.
“No.”
“And you will do right.
“Her devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her Majesty’s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.”
Are there any magistrates or judges at the Château d’If?”
At the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and he was obliged to obey.
“Yes, my son; and he rendered very important services to your father.
Mme.
People die very suddenly in your house, M. de Villefort.”
“Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.”
“My dear fellow,” replied Danglars, “you are three parts drunk; finish the bottle, and you will be completely so.
“That is well,” said Mme.
“Such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it.”
0025m
Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head.
I, indeed, invited them here today on your account.
“Gentlemen,” said the queen, “a few years ago I had around me ushers, treasures, armies; and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service.
One passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to dreams of ambition.
“Pray, sir,” said Villefort with marked uneasiness, “do not disturb yourself.”
This burden, almost as heavy as a world, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career.
This tranquillity proved one thing—that D’Artagnan did not yet know Milady.
“I will not suffer it!
“You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know where you are going?”
When it arrived there, four guards and a police officer, who accompanied it, mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters; then through an opening cautiously made, the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix, as if he was waiting for some one.
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form some resolution, adopt some plan.
Oh, those figures, how well I remember them!
I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker’s study.
Even before the coachman had hailed the _concierge_, the massy gates rolled on their hinges—they had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as everywhere else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning.
“What!
A bell resounded.
“To whom does this island belong?”
“Go on.”
There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter.”
“Yes; but it is not a horse for hard work.”
The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely.
Morrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance.
Chapter XX.
“Maillard,” began the curate, “this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little.”
Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his guests.
“Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears?
“RICHELIEU”
Adieu, and a prosperous voyage.
It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you.
“What can I do, friend?
to horse!”
Athos took her hand and kissed it.
He will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory,—and this surely is not vanity, but a justifiable pride,—it is important the world should know that I have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to strike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself.
“No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”
“Well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!” said Athos.
“My lord—I beg your highness’s pardon—but I must beg for half an hour’s leave of absence.”
“Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars?
La Ramee’s mouth watered and he returned to the duke’s chamber rubbing his hands.
“That is very simple.” Andrea took the pen.
Life is full of humiliations and sorrows,” continued he, becoming still more melancholy; “all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the golden ties.
Monsieur Duke, I must have those letters!”
“No, no,” continued Danglars; “if we resolve on such a step, it would be much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink, and write with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized) the denunciation we propose.” And Danglars, uniting practice with theory, wrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his usual style, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he handed to Fernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:
“I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free.
Why, then, have you laid it aside?”
“I do not quite understand you,” replied Franz; “pray explain your meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.”
D’Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber; the Swiss refused by shaking his head, and drew his sword.
“Quite alone?” he asked.
They directed their horses to the city.
By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planchet.
“If I durst say what I believe on that head—”
Porthos drew back a step.
Good!
15, Rue de Nouailles; he has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrel’s hands, and if there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than mine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself.”
“Strange!
“With me!” said the mendicant; “it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water.”
“And what effect does he produce?”
no!
“And Raoul—what shall you do with him?”
30151m
“Oh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O’Reilly.
not at all!” said D’Artagnan.
“I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_,” replied Morcerf, “but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing further to communicate—yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely, that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count, I heard the sound of a guzla—it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own.”
“You are young,” replied Athos; “and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances.”
“You don’t like him, my dear Parthenie,” said Scarron.
“Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week.
It was now a third full, just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes.
“Faith!
Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him, and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters.”
“Why?”
“Oh, the miserable wretches!” murmured the queen, “they shall pay dearly for their boldness, and it is I who promise this.”
“I am perhaps come too soon, count,” said he, “but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor has anyone in my house.
“Thou good Mousqueton!
The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man.
“Listen,” said the count.
Down there, you always had little presents and Christmas-boxes, which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse.
The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s arms.
“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.
Here we are without occupation, it seems to me.”
So, once more, good-night.’ Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold.
“Allow these gentlemen to pass,” he said; “they are friends of the Duc de Beaufort.”
“Mousqueton,” cried D’Artagnan, “let us be off!
“Confound it,” interrupted Porthos, with an explosion of passion which sent Mousqueton to the other end of the room; “are they in danger of dying?”
Ah!
He rode up a very quiet street, looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful Englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house, which, according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the street, he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted.
“Oh!
D’Artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw, which he obtained, at the rate of three pistoles each.
“The house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or, it may be, selfishness—it is not for me to read men’s hearts—has had any pity for me.
Ten men for Monsieur de Comminges.”
“I am going to her.”
He turned towards his wife.
The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold, face to face with D’Artagnan.
I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is——”
This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from observation.
“Pardon me,” said he; “but the instant your Majesty considers me a prejudiced judge, I withdraw.”
“Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean passage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès.
Behind D’Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.
My children, two of them, at least, the Duke of York and the Princess Elizabeth, are far away from me, exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes; my husband, the king, is leading in England so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired.
“Happy rogue,” said Caderousse; “you are going to find your servants, your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!”
I have known persons,” he continued—for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of D’Artagnan—“who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu; who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies; persons without money, without support, without credit, yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon.”
“I tell you,” one of them was saying, “that if Coysel predicted that, ’tis as good as true; I know nothing about it, but I have heard say that he’s not only an astrologer, but a magician.”
“But Mademoiselle de Villefort——” stammered the nurse.
“I think, decidedly,” observed Aramis, “gentlemen, that the son hasn’t his mother’s energy.”
“He is right,” said Porthos; “battle.
“Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.”
“Why, you told me he was a young man?
“Hush!” replied D’Artagnan; “the light no longer burns in yonder window.”
“It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.”
I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday.”
And I really don’t know what prevents me from exterminating you all.”
“I will never confess that but to the man—who should read to the bottom of my soul!”
“Ho!
“Yes,” said Aramis, “through an infamous act of treason.”
Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who, with the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of the Louvre.
“Have you had another fall at the Bourse?”
At last their hilarity calmed down and:
“Oh, yes, monsieur le comte, you know me and I know you.
“Yes,” replied Porthos, “it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first.
He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.
But as to what had been done by Porthos and D’Artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau.
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied with the most impertinent look possible.
She then returned to her room, calling for help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her window, which was twenty feet from the ground, was opened, a young peasant jumped into the chamber, seized her in his arms, and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass-plot, where she fainted.
“My political opinions!” replied Dantès.
The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening before it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies.
“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the subject.
Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door.
“I have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.”
Grimaud shuddered, and nodding, awaited the departure, regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence.
Can you be a coward, you, who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you?”
Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte.
“Eight days, my Lord.”
Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of D’Artagnan, and which D’Artagnan from that time made shift to do without.
“‘Listen!’ said he.
“And why was I arrested?
Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of his clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor—probably Blin or Humann.
“Ah, Valentine,” said Maximilian, “give me but one finger through this opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I may have the happiness of kissing it.”
“Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart.
Mistrust Athos, therefore, who will not prosecute the affairs of any one, even his own.
And Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase, crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.
“You have forgotten it, Porthos?” said he.
“Everything,” said Olivain to Athos, “has been done according to your directions; the horses are waiting.”
One only chance was left me, that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning.
There’s a providence that watches over the deserving.
“It is Lady Fairfax herself,” said D’Artagnan.
“What, M. Morrel!” said he in a low voice, “you send us away; you are then angry with us!”
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the helm.
That knife, which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of, because he knows the use I would make of it!
The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear, and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry, a small coffer of rosewood set in silver, and laying it on the altar:
“’Tis true—I said so, and I say it again.”
to take Mazarin.”
I swear it before Heaven.”
“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him into the sea.”
My clerks are honest men, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their deserts, if I may value them according to what they bring in; therefore I shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune.”
They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike sentry-boxes.
He determined to make two cardinals.’
This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole Dantès had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under it.

As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she does not love the English, but an Englishman.”
“Let us go to the king.”
“The chevalier!” murmured Charles.
Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and who is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march forward or to beat a retreat.
*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TWENTY YEARS AFTER ***
You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs, which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between us;—but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.”
Mousqueton!
“I have found already.”
“He is walking about and thinking,” thought D’Artagnan; “but of what?
“Speak as fully as you please, sir,” said the king, who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas’s face and affected Villefort’s voice.
“I hope,” said D’Artagnan, half dead with fright, “you made no mention of my diamond?”
Let us try not to find them out by accident, but from our notions.
Come, my lord, you shall be treated like a prince, as you are.”
“Not at all,” cried D’Artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be accomplished; “on the contrary, I think it very easy.
The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian Chapter 38.
YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
“And I?” asked Mazarin, after a moment’s silence.
The doctor pressed Valentine’s hand, and while he visited her grandmother, she descended the steps.
At seven o’clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at the second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night.
The bolt gave way and the door opened.
“On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune.
Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of D’Artagnan.
“Baron Danglars.”
I have come for nothing else but to tell you so.”
“Zounds!
All this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous effrontery, that D’Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard.
“That’s true,” replied D’Artagnan; “I have not the uniform, but I have the spirit.
Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except Monte Cristo, had been accorded an entrance into her presence.
“No,” replied the count; “I was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near Nîmes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore I did not choose to stop.”
They were taking the road toward Paris, when groans, which seemed to proceed from a ditch, attracted their attention.
“Only dismount; another will be immediately saddled.”
Porthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed Athos.
An instant afterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth pressed her forehead.
“Your highness’s most devoted servant,
And is he still in love with the Catalane?”
“No, my Lord,” replied the impassive young man; “your Lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me.”
“We shall see.
“Sir,” said Anne to Mazarin, with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression, “see if we can do something for these gentlemen.”
Meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner, as well as for those who were preparing his escape; only for him it passed more slowly.
Still the same story of superfluities!
Pray don’t heed him, sir!—he only barks, he never bites.
“But what is there to investigate, sir?” said Albert, enraged beyond measure at Beauchamp’s last remark.
Would not that dress please you?”
0177m
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.
“I believe you are right.”
Set out, therefore, in a week, with your suite, and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette, Rue Tiquetonne, and there await me.”
“Listen to me, my dear girl,” said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; “you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation.
Yes, Athos, I know what you mean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.”
“It is very clear, notwithstanding,” replied the young man, with an artlessness wholly free from affectation; “tell her some fine morning an unheard-of piece of intelligence—some telegraphic despatch, of which you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV.
This is what had happened.
Then a voice reached them once more, sending this threat: “To our next meeting, sirs, in England.”
You know, Athos, you never spoke much of such matters.”
At present I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government.”
Now, if they believed us, they laughed in order to insult us; if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more.
“What, does Monsieur know this horse?” said Mousqueton.
“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the hand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”
Stay, here is another louis for you.”
He would at once approach Valentine’s father and acknowledge all, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts.
Château-Renaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder.
You gave your direction to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table.
I thought you would never come in.”
“I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,” said Buckingham.
“He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.”
“Charles Stuart,” said the colonel of the English regiment, approaching the king, who had just put on the insignia of royalty, “do you yield yourself a prisoner?”
Mother Nanette!” cried Friquet, suffocating; “ah!
He flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door.
The luck had turned, and Groslow, having won some hundred pistoles, was in the merriest possible humor.
A bad joke of the husband’s substituted the other; but the husband has been punished since, and I have obtained full satisfaction.”
“The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he fell with Teresa in his arms.
“What?
Behind them, by another outlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight.
This double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any resistance.
“What is it?”
A deathlike silence reigned in the room above.
I am tired of hearing only of market reports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish funds, of Haitian bonds.
de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with increased vehemence, “there are occasions when I dispense with all foolish human circumspection.
And you will tell him I will publish the report of Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru, upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade.
Perhaps never in her life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions, felt her heart beat so violently.
The door was scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into the arms of her women.
“Hate you, sweet Valentine,” exclaimed the young man; “how is it possible for anyone to do that?”
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF ARAMIS Chapter V. THE KING’S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL’S GUARDS Chapter VI.
Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him.
“At the Rospoli Palace.”
The second operation was as successful as the first, _La Jeune Amélie_ was in luck.
“Come, come,” said he, “will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly?
And having got out all he wanted, he paid for the hypocras, which he did not drink, and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne.
true.
You shall relate them to me, my child.
The court made songs on the Parisians and the Parisians on the court; and the casualties, though not mortal, were painful, as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule.
At length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on the road of Sèvres.
It was four o’clock when Dantès was placed in this chamber.
Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword, which stood against a chair in a corner of the room; but a glance from the worthy Broussel, who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind, checked this foolhardy action of despair.
“Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was here.”
“Now, my dear Guitant, I have often remarked that in addition to your courage, which is indisputable, and your fidelity, which is invincible, you possess an admirable memory.”
“For a whim.”
But, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers.
“These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,” said Monte Cristo.
“It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if it will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king’s attorney, he would have interested himself somewhat more about it.”
“All is not then over?” asked Rochefort.
We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post.
“Well, merit this pretended happiness, then!”
Albert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he most desired to know,—how she had become the slave of the count.
“Now,” said Athos, “that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us, let us go and see the king’s entrance.”
Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt, and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count,—a warning he might not be able to send another time, if this first attempt should fail and another be made.’”
Morcerf thanked him with a smile, and pushed open the door above which were his arms, and which, as we have said, opened into the salon.
On going home, the two friends found a letter from Athos, who desired them to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day.
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer with her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely, imploring her like a divinity.
The duke glanced at the clock.
Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived.
“Richelieu was a gentleman, our equal in birth, our superior in position.
“Yes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.
I can scarcely credit it.”
“‘Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman.’
This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy father abandon thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall pursue the assassin.”
“Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.”
Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of Franche-Comte.
“He is preparing a way for your majesty to escape.
Cries of “Down with Mazarin!” “Death to the cardinal!” resounded on all sides.
“Like the ancient paladins, he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love.
The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped before the count’s door.
I have, therefore, as you see, great need of hearing from you.
Nor was it from caprice we asked the question, for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church.
Well, am I to rush into his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, ‘My father, my father!’ like Monsieur Pixérécourt.”27
“I ought,” muttered Anne to herself, “by this time to remember that these men are giants.”
Besides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on—that this issue was near, and could not fail to be terrible.
Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it.”
“You shall not call,” said Felton, throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver.
“A jest.”
Go away now, Mouston.”
Caderousse smiled bitterly.
When all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Tréville, on turning round, found himself alone with the young man.
Cromwell looked at him with astonishment.
“Sit down,” said the old man.
“Those in whom the king has confided—Lord Leven’s Highlanders.”
D’Artagnan then remembered the injunction: “If you value your own life or that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had seen nothing.”
“Doctor, I resist no longer—I can no longer defend myself—I believe you; but, for pity’s sake, spare my life, my honor!”
“You do not know him?”
“Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, addressing his landlord, “since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?”
“Let us speak of M. Zaccone.”
“Yes,” replied Beauchamp.
The former had no doubt finished his questions, for a moment later he said good-night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier.
“It is singular,” said D’Artagnan, whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard, “it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known, but who it was I cannot yet remember.”
“Sir,” said he, with compressed lips and flashing eyes, “you have not the presumption to instruct the Comte de la Fere and myself what we ought to say here?”
As he passed the table on which the axe was laid, he stopped, and turning with a smile, said:
death to the guards!
That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman.
“Pray,” said the lackey, “say nothing about it, monsieur; it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess!”
One was the notary’s; the other, that of Franz and his friends.
Bonacieux would have any suspicion.
“Oh!
I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love, yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart.
“He will do wonders then.”
“It looks more like bankruptcy!” exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.
He was at least forty; and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present.
“With what an air he says all this,” muttered Beauchamp; “decidedly he is a great man.”
“Not badly, by any means,” said the young man; “I was born for a diplomatist.”
“And how did this despatch reach you?” inquired the king.
“He—he—is——” murmured Grimaud, pale as a ghost and seizing his master’s hand.
“And what was it?”
“Alone, Valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit.
I’Gad!
Dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore, in the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of the ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination, and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin’s Babylonian pictures.
“That was the general opinion, sir,” said the major, “and I——”
Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth?
“Why, count,” exclaimed Eugénie, “what has happened to your ward?
I was conducting some friends, Musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a stranger—a man who sought a quarrel with him, for I don’t know what.”
They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert.
D’Artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went back to Athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp.
Chapter 59.
“And so, my dear count,” said D’Artagnan, “his eminence didn’t actually insist on our attending him; it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted, and even in a manner somewhat impolite, perhaps, so great was our longing to see you.”
He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow.
“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “the evening of the 3rd of June, 1829.
Now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race.
“Now,” said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,—“now let us talk about our own affairs.
was struck with this insistence, and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery.
“Decidedly; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same way.”
Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will.
“Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?”
“Capital!” exclaimed the Gascon.
Listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him; one takes away from him all claim to good sense, another robs him of his poetry, a third of his originality, another of his humor, another of his independence of character, a sixth—but, good heavens!
“Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had overcome Teresa.
“And what has happened to you, my dear Porthos?” continued D’Artagnan.
“But how can that be?
After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock, from whence he could behold the sea.
“Do you then suspect anyone?”
Leaving the church, a woman and a young girl dressed in black, the one as a widow and the other as an orphan, have re-entered their cell.
But the Prince de Marsillac!
Don’t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you.
Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.
“After the execution?” cried Franz.
Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation, added to the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.”
They promised, upon separating, to meet at the Duke of Bracciano’s ball, to which all Rome was invited.
“My grandfather intends leaving this house,” said she, “and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another.”
He had been contented, for the convenience of the house, to lodge in the fourth story; and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof.
“All my sausages are gnawed!”
The distance was short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or rather the count’s, stopped before the Hôtel de Londres.
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti.
Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance, received the traveller at the door, hat in hand.
He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous and inauspicious.
This was more than poor Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.
I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin; but——”
Dantès’ eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.
Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees?—that poor innocent offspring of mine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many, many tears.
“Monsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing.
“The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.”
“It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,” replied Danglars.
“Come, come,” continued D’Arminges, “to dinner;” for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast.
Bazin, scandalized, made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand.
Let us call one of these lackeys, with a demi-pistole in the left hand.”
Chapter XLI.
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23, 1628 Chapter LX.
Bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description.
If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan, which my ancestors, impoverished by the Crusades, allowed to fall into ruins, and to buy thirty acres of land about it, that is all I wish.
“Gave him?” cried D’Artagnan.
“And shall you dine there?”
“Sir,” replied Monte Cristo coldly, “I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs.
Speak.”
“I can imagine the effect, I do not see the means.”
“Well, then, madame, yes, I did feel fear; and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and skirmishes, I own for the third time in my life I was afraid.
One day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.”
By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercédès to spare her son, the count at last exclaimed:
But for D’Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a smile, all shades were diaphanous.
“All owing to your influence,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling.
“Certainly.”
“I think he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.”
“I think so.”
“Why, I paid him.”
Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm; Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot.
“Come,” said Andrea, “what do you want?”
“When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are not of the same race.”
“That is because we are talking Spanish, my dear friend,” said Athos.
“Seven of his Eminence’s Guards placed _hors de combat_ by you four in two days!
as my grandfather used to say, I once reigned in Paris!
“Monsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat without the combatants seeing me.”
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur.
“Sire,” said Villefort, “I will render a faithful report to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language.” A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor, and he went on:
Obeying the queen, Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen, in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded him.
“It was an apparition.”
“Who is Madame?” asked Château-Renaud.
“I quite understand why you ask, sir,” said Eugénie, making a sign that her father might be seated, “and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation.
Athos bowed.
“Well, then, let it be war!
“Yes, I will reduce this rebellious city to ashes.
Athos paused.
Four or five cloaks had already been lifted, with a dexterity without parallel, and not one of the victims had dared to say a word, when some fool of a fellow, less patient than the others, took it into his head to cry out, ‘Guard!’ and drew upon us a patrol of archers.
“We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay.”
Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its contents at one draught.
At other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his friends not to disturb him.
“‘Woman!’
30, Avenue des Champs-Élysées; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright, and are, no doubt, desirous of returning home.
The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him.
We are ready.”
“I wanted to see the good curé again.
Well, how much for the equipments?”
He, the man who would be popular, cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer; and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned—yes, it is all from the same cause.”
“You have, then, decided to come to England again,” said Lord de Winter, “in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground?”
Do not exaggerate your duty.
“The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris.
“A woman!
He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness.
All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted, D’Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze upon her, were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided between his hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger placed upon her mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace, reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey, and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint.
I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with.
Help, comrades, help!”
“Why not?”
“What fine words he uses!”
I was brought up in the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher.”
“Do you wish for anything?”
Write to me at Paris, to M. Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No.
“Since then,” continued Aramis, “I have lived very agreeably.
The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion; he trembled all over; he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask.
Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement?
Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant, for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own.
And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper.
The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court.
“Yes, he has just gone out.”
They left the chamber at the same time.
Thus Louis XIII.
“Yes.”
I always knew you were a good son.”
“It is unfortunate,” returned he, “that you have never visited the environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.”
It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”
Have you anything particular against him?”
“Here, in an hour.
Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel’s entrance, it was again opened for the count.
“Do you think you have to do with galley-slaves, or novices in the world?
If succor be sent to me, I will accept it.”
“Bravo!
The three listeners looked at one another in alarm.
“Higher, much higher.”
“Your pardon?” said Richelieu, surprised.
“I am a gallant fellow.”
“But who, who?
That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation.
“That shall be testified to, rest assured.
“I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, is rich—he has an annuity.”
Danglars is his banker, is he not?” asked Château-Renaud of Debray.
His hair stood on end.
Mercédès and Albert were in that room.
Valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear.
In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone.
Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend.
But neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some house.
She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made him a sign to dismount and come to her.
He was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs by which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended.
“Bah, you are wrong.
I am really sorry to go away without having seen Grimaud.”
The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away.
“Who and what are you?” demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour’s time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which “the accused” is always made the victim.
He turned around and Mordaunt stood before him.
But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his dagger.
“At what hour?”
You met a monk, did you not?”
“Where we have orders to lead you.”
20261m
At last, one day, when for the hundredth time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child.
Above you there is the king; above the king there is God!’
Albert appeared not to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that Madame Danglars blushed.
“Ah, here is a private staircase,” said the count; “that is convenient.
“I do not desire to do otherwise.”
“It is you, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” she said, fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer, “and I know you well.
Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day.
Fatality.
Have you seen him?”
The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy, and grew old in stratagems and spoils.
“Alas!” said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, “I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink myself.”
“Do you know modern Greek,” asked he.
“Willingly, my lord.
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.
The door opened, and D’Artagnan went into the chamber.
Why do you not realize a six months’, a year’s advance even, and retire to Brussels?
What story can I invent?
“You have accomplished these different crimes with impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them.
“I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is a serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.”
She stopped on the threshold, breathed a sigh, and addressing the queen:
“How I have searched for him,” replied Villefort, wringing his hands; “how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men, and to find mine among them!
D’Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his _self_-love: he thought that it was in his _love_.
“Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening?”
Athos threw himself into D’Artagnan’s arms.
Without doubt he recognized D’Artagnan, for he became deadly pale; doubtless the musketeer knew him, for his hair stood up on his head.
“You know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse.
They needed breakfast, and alighted at the door of an _auberge_, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin giving half his cloak to a poor man.
“Let him know.”
And would you still cane me if I took it into my head to disobey you?
“I arrived an hour since.”
Revolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and arranged the topography of the garden in her head.
“A man or a woman?”
“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.
Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army, whilst Olivain, with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch, protected the rear.
“All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words, I poured out upon this man.
“Therefore,” continued Valentine, looking playfully at Maximilian, “no more inconsiderate actions—no more rash projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?”
I was not willing to fly.
“I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?” asked Monte Cristo.
“Ah, Haitians,—that is quite another thing!
“And what said the abbé?” asked Athos.
But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of us; it is unpardonable.”
“Is he not your friend?” replied the baron, negligently.
Mme.
Night overtook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn.
“Yes, and without violence,” said Louise.
“Let us not misunderstand each other,” replied Monte Cristo; “I introduce no one, and certainly not M. Cavalcanti.”
“Yes, there is something I wish to see.”
“An admirable subject!” cried the Jesuit.
“Look at that large clumsy bed, hung with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery!
Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain.
“We will go and see,” said the doctor; “what you tell me seems very strange.” The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone.
Cahusac turned.
“I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Méran’s death—because his system is accustomed to that very poison, and the dose was trifling to him, which would be fatal to another; because no one knows, not even the assassin, that, for the last twelve months, I have given M. Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection, while the assassin is not ignorant, for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison.”
“Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven.
At the same instant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated the boards all round us.
Deuce take it—all the worse for me!”
She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a red and black bodice, and golden pins in her hair.
“And you, too, my poor Monsieur Mouston, are out of place in this poor hotel, are you not?” asked D’Artagnan, in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery.
Athos, in his turn, smiled also.
The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity.
“You have some plan, then?” asked Athos.
“No.”
“Come,” said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, “are you a man again, Maximilian?”
Planchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the stains of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted.
what is he himself?” asked Madame Henrietta.
Cross them; that’s right!”
“It is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the great gateway, ready saddled for your departure.”
The Trial
That we may be more at our ease, La Ramee removes the guards, keeping only Grimaud to wait on us.
Porthos’s chamber is, you say, on the first story, Number One?”
“You know, Bragelonne,” said Athos, “I never speak without reflection.”
You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune; besides, they say I am already rich in right of my mother—too rich, even.
Porthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell.
“This skiff might be of use to you for personal projects.”
At these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her.
Get down into the longboat.”
“How can I understand?
The hungry friends, followed by their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for according to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.
“Gentlemen, did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall?
Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coup-d’etat, which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton.
About seven o’clock in the morning they set out.
“Certainly I have.”
“What is the matter with you, my friend?” asked the latter.
D’Artagnan shook his head.
“Do not let us jest,” gravely replied Bertuccio, “and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it.”
I know how clear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by it, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you.
Great people only thank you for doing the impossible; what’s possible, they say, they can effect themselves, and they are right.
At nine o’clock the night had fully come.
When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man.
“I have something better than that,” said Monte Cristo; “I have a slave.
Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived.
“You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon?”
I will, in the meantime, go and prepare the young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself.”
“Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I know not; but one evening, about five o’clock, our little cabin-boy came breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our direction.
“The secret is,” said Athos, “that I saw Milady last night.”
“I shall ask him.”
The three friends burst into laughter.
“Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and others that he did not possess a farthing.”
“Is it possible,” exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment, “that these horses belong to the baroness?”
Will that do?”
“You promised me something else.”
The soldiers, whom he was nearly trampling, ran away.
Chapter LXIV.
Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded.
“Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?”
Valentine sank weeping into a chair.
“Well, you shall have your five hundred francs,” said Andrea; “but it is very hard for me, my poor Caderousse—you take advantage——”
Morrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it.
Go.”
had entertained toward Mazarin, and he endeavored to receive the minister’s homage with civility.
“Not before I have killed you, poltroon!” cried D’Artagnan, making the best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.
“Enough, sir,” said Morcerf, “we will speak no more on the subject.”
Anne of Austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal—his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur.
“Their names?” asked the monk.
D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside.
And you, Porthos?”
But you were just speaking on a very interesting topic, Beauchamp.”
Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who resides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid.
“What next?
“Remember,” said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword, “the least delay may ruin everything.”
“At Tréport?”
The Duc d’Elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife, one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty-five thousand for each of the three others.

The Room of the Retired Baker Chapter 82.
By eight o’clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.
Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering, and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features, but which was gone in a moment.
And the thing was so much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs.
They all went out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been afraid to go up into the study.
Madame Danglars therefore came, not only beautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one door at the time when Mercédès appeared at the door.
“Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce the good news to me?”
“The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.
An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him.
“My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still young.”
“Yes, Buckingham.”
“She gave me none; she told me to wait, and I waited.”
“Is monsieur your cousin?
M. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsinari.
“It is not for nothing that I am styled Louis the Just,” and he signed Emery’s appointment.
Gimblou, another bottle.”
stop!” cried D’Artagnan, giving rein to his famous steed, who, darting forth, overturned several men.
Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth, pronounced this one word, “Pointed.”
He did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch; only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance.
M. d’Artagnan, my dear M. d’Artagnan,” he called out in a coaxing voice, “will you answer for everything?”
“Sire,” replied the cardinal, sighing, “I believed myself secure from such a suspicion.”
The Scotchman.
“Ah, indeed, so much the better!” said Lord de Winter.
The baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti, senior, then the baroness, afterwards the “future couple,” as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents.
“Exceedingly,” replied Franz.
“But you, Aramis, who were close to him?”
“But first,” said Morrel, “allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting her.”
“Nothing, nothing, only shut the window.
The two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince, and so reached the Saint Denis gate.
“If your eminence should order me to arrest the devil, I would seize him by the horns and would bring him in.”
“But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!”
Porthos paid no attention.
“Aw?” said the Englishman, “I practice shooting every day, and every other day Grisier comes to my house.”
“Perfectly true; but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles.
“Do you want money?”
“Come, D’Artagnan, don’t let us play a sidelong game; your hesitation, your evasion, tells me at once on whose side you are; for that party no one dares openly to recruit, and when people recruit for it, it is with averted eyes and humble voice.”
“Yes, monsieur, you are right,” said the host.
I saw, amid the shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour later it reappeared, bearing my supper.
Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard?” She opened Noirtier’s door, ran to a window in the passage, and returned hastily.
“I don’t know what it was.
“I believe I can guess, at least.”
On seeing the prince they hastened to meet him.
“I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?”
If he wanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the left.
Parry bent over his master’s hand and kissed it respectfully.
“Witty?”
I am condemned; leave me to my death.”
The carriage stopped at the door of the palace.
“I am that individual,” replied the officer.
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter, she placed herself at the table and ate.
Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.
“From the count,” said Bertuccio.
Have they offered you money?
He was not, however, a good sleeper.
So you see, being in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed to the teeth.”

“Were I in her majesty’s place,” said Gondy, coldly, “I should not hesitate; I should release Broussel.”
“Tomorrow at daybreak.
“Very well, sir, find this man, and when you have found him bring him to me.”
A month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow.

If, then, I should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my conduct, that very instant you would quit my service.
There was a dispute among the guards.
I really believe you are a man, and a violent one, too.”
And D’Artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver.
“Then give me that letter, madame,” said the chancellor.
“If he lays his hand on the boat’s edge I will cut it off, regicide that he is.”
“I made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an outlet of some kind; but there was none.
When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped.
It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran.
“Force her door!” said the cardinal, “and for what purpose?”
We, at least, must keep close to monseigneur; the rest of the start will rejoin us later.
And thou hast left him noble, honored, powerful, for the ruin of us all!”
The door immediately closed, and D’Artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity.
And she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.
You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.’
It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker.
I thought you wished them to forget you?”
His prediction was nearly fulfilled, but in a very different way from that which De Bassompierre supposed; for after the death of Richelieu everything went on, contrary to expectation, in the same way as before; and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison.
“Well, what shall you do with this money, count?
“It is not ill-planned,” said the governor.
“Stay you where you are and don’t you stir, or I will pull this ear off.
To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges, and I only acknowledge you as my executioners.” And in the middle of a deathlike silence, Charles, calm, lofty, and with his head still covered, sat down again in his arm-chair.
I am brother to Parry, his majesty’s lackey.”
“Stop,” said the duke, “Pistache, jump for the queen.” And he raised his cane six inches higher.
“But there must be some cause for this strange scene.”
D’Artagnan had appointed six o’clock in the morning for his lackey, and wherever he might be, he was right.
had just granted to him with his estate of Épinay.
The pope awaited him.
“Drink this, and then take nothing more tonight.”
The lantern was placed on the ground, the two adversaries took their stations, and the duel began.
“I do not know you for one of us.”
Take it, and there ends the matter.”
“Indiscretion,—oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject.
“Have you not slept?” said the jailer.
“Who, I?”
One of the notaries sat down, the other remained standing.
“You jest, sir!” answered the queen, endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity.
“Sir,” he said, turning to Athos, “was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess de Chevreuse, and is she not the queen?”
“The stone seems very brilliant,” answered the count.
You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.
This order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder.
But no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks and packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.
Now, while admiring, as others doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought.
As I have said, she was twice married, once in France, the second time in England.”
Blaisois went with him.
“You think so?”
She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect.
The day was passed at Saint Peter’s alone.
“Halloo, gentlemen!” he called out in his Gascon accent, “what do you want?
Oh, God, thou hast preserved my memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!”

“He is merely my father,” said Albert—“M.

“But,” said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, “never mind the past; let us only remember the present.
“I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haydée; through you I again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you rejoice.”
“Well,” observed Franz, “this chief is very polite, and I see no objection—the more so as I bring my share of the supper.”
“Well,” replied Mercédès, sighing, “go, Albert; I will not make you a slave to your filial piety.”
“Eh!
“If they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,” said D’Artagnan to himself.
Do as I bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at eleven o’clock—you have heard what I said.”
“No, he is a man about my own size.”
But it was not you, I presume, who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in Paris—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to me just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.
“A mere child.”
What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he murmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”
Who talks of dying?
I do nothing without her commands—pray understand that; not like Monsieur de Richelieu, who went on just as he pleased.
“Look attentively, then, at this gentleman.”
D’Artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to Kitty’s chamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do—and that for two reasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches, recriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if possible, to fathom those of this woman.
The procurator’s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos had put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived.
In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards.
There were but three hôtels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.
The event was announced by the cessation of the firing.
Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second, after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids.
Go.”
“Sire,” replied Tréville, without lowering his voice in the least, “either order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.”
I concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments, I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider.
Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand looked pale and agitated.”
“Come, gentlemen,—some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,” and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.
“Opposite the scaffold?”
“The chemist who came here with me.”
“One can do it!
He stifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk.
The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness, while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity.
“It is at this moment,” replied Barrois with the same firmness, “that M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M. Franz d’Épinay.”
I believe, then, that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of those of a lady much greater than herself.”
“Follow me,” said Morrel; “I will take you to my sister, who is worthy also to be yours.
This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was.
“Sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, without using any circumlocution, and as if fearing she had no time to lose, “you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child?”
“The good George!” said she, closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy.
I will begin again, then:
“No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes.”
“In the first place,” he said, making an effort to control himself, “we are not people who may be treated anyhow; my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche.
He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united.
“Yes, monsieur,” said Planchet, “and I will go as soon as you please.
Villefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared at the Rue Bussy.
Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get such a man as that.
“Ah,” said Caderousse, “No.
“My son,” said the king to Aramis, “do not take it so to heart.
The instant she appeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment; and on her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a private passage to M. de Villefort’s office.
“This gentleman asks me for information, which common politeness will not permit me to refuse.”
Pray, was not Monsieur d’Artagnan, in the time of the cardinal, mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out, according to report, quite cleverly?”
Bonacieux; “you will ruin us all!”
Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows.
Chapter XXIX.
“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each other, I hope.”
“Valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the beatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be asleep; then you will see.”
“Then she is dead?” stammered D’Artagnan.
“Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now it’s all over—everything is all right again.”
In order to make one’s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves, it was necessary to be an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.
Baron Danglars is a good father, and knows how to calculate.”
“Ah, sir,” she muttered, “ah, sir,” and this was all.
The young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the Morrel family.
“Oh!
“If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever you may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a small annuity; for, if you return home safely, then——”
“Why do you not seek revenge?”
“On the contrary, my boy, on the contrary, I am pleased with your zeal.
Yet, through a singular impulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied, but to Emmanuel.
Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt?
“What, that which brings you home to me?
“Ah, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, as if to sum up in a word all that conversation, “if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our liberty.”
“What rival?”
“Come, gentlemen,” said he, “they are beating the tattoo.
La Ramee, some day when he sends for you, you must let me put on your clothes; I will go in your stead; I will strangle him, and upon my honor, if that is made a condition I will return to prison.”
“And why has the count bought a rock?”
“Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp—visit him alone.”
He approached the block and laid his axe upon it.
Then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the drawing-room into the garden.
Mousqueton!”
At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts.
Oh, how distinctly I remember that kiss!—it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were still warm on my forehead.
During the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried Noirtier from Valentine’s room into his own, and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.
D’Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like a dart between them.
“In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar,” replied the staunch Puritan.
“I thought I recognized him, and was not mistaken.
It would be a dishonor to all the nobility.”
We cannot fight with such names; they are names of shepherds.”
“Why did he not tell them his name?
So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the king, the Duc d’Angoulême; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.
“Rue de la Harpe.
I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt.
They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way, and then were stopped by, “Who comes there?” At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel.
“Beauchamp will never retract.”
“But at a tremendous discount, of course?”
During this passage, Felton related everything to Milady—how, instead of going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had returned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and how, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder.
The space was cleared, the two lamps placed on Cromwell’s desk, in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible; and the swords crossed.
“Have it examined by the governor of the port,” said the shipmaster, “and give me the preference.”
La Ramee drew near to Grimaud, who spoke to him in a low voice.
Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.
“Do you not know me, Felton?
We must be expeditious.
No, no; I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you say.
“About noon?
Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, “Kill Dantès!
“About what?”
“By the tower of Montlhéry, you mean?”
I only wait till you give them.”
These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had anticipated.
“No.”
We know the count’s vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible, with that energy which marks the great man.
And I have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.”

You love me, madame; it is enough.”
“The _Pharaon_!” he cried; “the _Pharaon_!”
“Come in,” said Franz.

We four will go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number.”
The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church.”
“Our host.”
The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths, leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers; for on approaching nearer, instead of one extended figure, the young men discovered two.
Bazin was their only attendant, for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqueton.
“Perhaps not,” replied Danglars; “but I hear that he is ambitious, and that’s rather against him.”
D’Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey, then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of Milady.
“Truly?”
“Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.
“Now what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, ‘when in doubt, keep out.’”
The recommendation was needless.
I don’t see what is to keep me here.”
Chapter 15.
Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had your mother’s sanction.
“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only wanted a murder, and here it is.
During these hours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath.
“Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring, which was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again, you have a few minutes’ work there.”
Indeed, indeed I did not!’
D’Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady.
You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid.”
“And what am I to pay with, brute?” said Danglars, enraged.
THE RETURN
Some sang ballads about Mme.
“Ah!” exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice.
In the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him.

And I, who have answered for him to the queen—I, who have promised my poor mistress—ah, my God, my God!
At once Mme.
This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of God.
Tell him also what you have just told me—that Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit, and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity.”
“I thought so.
And he turned up two cards as usual, a king for D’Artagnan and an ace for himself.
“Listen, my lord,” said the queen; “I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother, and this order of St. Michael which came from my husband.
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.
I mean M. de Villefort, the king’s attorney.”
He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mail-coach.
you lose ground, you are turning?
Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantès knew that the mistral was blowing.
“One by the post, Madame Danglars’ footman left the other.”
“You see someone pays me a visit.
“Basset?”
Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm.
At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he saw one of the three windows open.
Thank you, Parry.”
I do not understand you.”
We will judge you in spite of your silence.
“Joy, joy—the sum is large!”
Now, as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence, it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer, exact, precise, positive.
“I recognize him.”
Milady asked some questions about the carriage.
But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care, and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world.
“_Pardieu_,” returned Franz, laughing, “in token of your ingratitude.”
“Saved!” replied the young officer.
“No; the king’s friend,” said Aramis; “the king’s friend, you understand.
Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud’s ear.
“Sire,” said Winter, who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up, “we are ready.”
However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.”
“I perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.”
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which was determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations, and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war.
“Precisely,” said the cardinal.
Each examined his arms, and put them in order.
I will send word to the governor.”
“Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,” said the servant, who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress.
“More than my life.”
nothing more than natural.
Several horsemen ran quickly to him.
All this showed D’Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something; but he could not yet see under this veil.
The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like those which we see on the faces of the dead.
Therefore, in my opinion, my dear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows, why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.”
The same evening some friends of mine visited me,—M.
Ten times, as I told you, he came to see Dantès’ father, and offered to receive him in his own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old man’s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond’s father died, as he had lived, without doing harm to anyone.
Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.
Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman.
“And his name?”
On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires, the curate pointed toward the square before the church.
“I do not know.”
“And was this lady young and handsome?” asked the cardinal, with a certain degree of anxiety.
I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italian—of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow—of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king—who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison, not daring to kill them, as our great cardinal—our cardinal did—of the miser, who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear, though he is rich, of losing them at play next morning—of the impudent fellow who insults the queen, as they say—so much the worse for her—and who is going in three months to make war upon us, in order that he may retain his pensions; is that the master whom you propose to me?
Dantès had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the cavern.
My God, it is I—I—and this fellow who will help me to avenge myself.”
how pale you look!”
Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother.
“I think so, indeed,” cried he.
“Yes,” answered Franz; “and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated.”
“How so?”
“By five minutes.”
His head, supported by a long and flexible neck, issued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell.
But dress me as well as you are able, only make haste; think, my dear girl, it’s life and death!”
“I have no time to lose.
I would have done it for half that, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand; why did you not think of me, ungrateful man?”
“Now, then, Margotin,” cried he, speaking to the dog, “will you be quiet?
“Why?” asked Porthos.
“I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.”
“What battle does it represent?”
“Planchet!” repeated Aramis and Porthos.
“‘Ah,’ responded the woman, with an expression impossible to describe; ‘I thought it was for something else.’
I am expiating a moment of selfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she complains, ‘Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.’” And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance.
“‘Yes,’ replied the brigadier; ‘and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had helped us to catch him.’ The two young persons exchanged looks.
“Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender,” said he.
“Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!”
Mother and Son Chapter 92.
That king, who was so grand, so sublime in the hour of death, meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips, now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth.
Henrietta Maria and Mazarin.
It was simply yet richly furnished.
“And what cares he for that,” replied Gaetano with a laugh, “or any authorities?
“You wish to see me, and you come to England.
“My dear Monsieur Bertuccio,” said Monte Cristo, laughing, “control yourself; we are not at Sartène or at Corte.
“Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others; secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp’s journal; and thirdly, from my own imagination.
But Morrel, disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other’s condescension.
It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler.
“Take these,” said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.
The Morrel Family
“Benedetto?” he muttered; “fatality!”
“Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,” replied Franz, “which will make it still more difficult.”
What man is that?” cried Milady, suffocated by terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid countenance as if alive.
He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as late as possible in the evening.
“When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.”
I descended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees.
“Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.”
Lord de Winter did the same.
“Agreeable?”
“Ah, monsieur!”
“Yes,” replied the old man.
Mouston breathed a sigh; he couldn’t understand visits of ceremony made under arms.
“How many did we crush under the wall?”
“What was the matter with you, baron?” D’Artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the Palais Royal.
Cucumetto stopped at last, and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.
“You want to know how we came here?
“Ah, do not fear, sir,” said Mordaunt, with apparent simplicity: “it will not ruin you.”
“Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don’t stand upon ceremony,” said D’Artagnan, “but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep.
“Aha!” continued D’Artagnan, “it is clear that they are afraid of something or other; for look, the sentinels are being reinforced.
The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.

His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them.
His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his way without uttering a single word.
“No, no, friend,” replied the doctor, “you will soon cease to suffer.”
That he has given the diamond to us only?” inquired Caderousse, half bewildered with joy; “yes, nothing more true!
The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene.
The Viscount of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.”
“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”
“Oh, no,” replied Caderousse, “that I can answer for, you did not.
“‘How should I know who they are?’
Then she grasped the front hair, which she also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the contrary, her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows.
Now, as upon this audience, in his Gascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and Porthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery.
“Oliver Cromwell.”
“You do not sanction our project?”
“It is well as it is; say no more about it.”
He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move.
Aramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.
We stepped into the boat.
“Well, then, my lord, they must be found; but what can four men, or rather three men do—for I tell you, you must not count on Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire, for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.
“I can do much for you, my friend,” replied the count.
Chapter 14.
“What have I to fear,” replied D’Artagnan, “as long as I shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?”
_Peste!_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs, and come home at the hour when other people are going out.”
Then D’Artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the Rue de la Juiverie and enter, in the Rue de la Calandre, a respectable looking house; and this D’Artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle.
“Well, this waistcoat was discovered today, covered with blood, and with a hole over the heart.” The ladies screamed, and two or three prepared to faint.
She has near her a certain Laporte.”
“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “what do you see in that to annoy you?”
“But there were three races, were there not?”
Order whatever you like for supper—the only thing I specify is one of those pies; and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies—not only now, but when I leave my prison.”
Chapter XXXIX.
And without any other complaint, passive and obedient, either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois, Mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost.
“A child who will be of age in four years.
“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris.
“How?
“No, upon my honor!” cried his Majesty’s Guardsman.
“No,” Aramis replied.
Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court; but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility, while the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of France.
Dantès turned pale, hesitated, and reflected.
Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into a gallop, and rode straight up to D’Artagnan.
“Have you any money?”
Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the ante-chamber, where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting.
“Why should they not?
My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a question?”
“But—formerly—it appears,” began Mousqueton timidly.
“That Bonacieux.”
But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with him.”
I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”
“Fire, fire!” cried Mordaunt, returning to the group surrounding the two friends.
my lord!” cried the Gascon, “don’t threaten!
“Beware, Athos, beware.
“Are we alone?”
“And a comforting one, too,” added D’Artagnan, seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man.
“And you—do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois?”
“_Di quà_,” said one of the men, descending a little path leading out of the Appian Way.
At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.
This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry, madame.
The host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow, which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi Vampa.
“The devil!” thought D’Artagnan.
I will go and see about that, and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence.”
What a dreadful death—what a blow!
The passageway sloped in a gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another.
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.”
Many, also, who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris, were struck with the worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly played the nobleman very well, so long as he said nothing, and made no arithmetical calculations.
With a single glance Villefort’s eye ran through the room.
“Yes,” returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point he wished.
No false modesty; take the best horse you can find.
It was a mixed mass of blue, red, and gold.
“That of the patrol going their rounds.”
But the night was cold, dull, and rainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was “_Non capisco_.”
The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all other furnished drawing-rooms.
You will have pity on me.”
The following morning, with the banker’s usual punctuality, the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man’s hands, as he was on the point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse.
As to Planchet, he has certain reasons for not going to court.”
A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity.
Like a philosopher.”
Then, turning toward Planchet, he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon.
Chapter 3.
“I do not often laugh, sir,” replied the stranger, “as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the privilege of laughing when I please.”
The latter rose and bowed to the countess, who inclined herself without speaking.
“On my word,” replied the count, “not more than another.
[14] Greek militiamen in the war for independence.—Ed.
The governor of the Bastile was Monsieur du Tremblay, the brother of the famous Capuchin, Joseph, that fearful favorite of Richelieu’s, who went by the name of the Gray Cardinal.
A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common, every-day sort of attachment such as ours.
“My dear Monsieur de Comminges,” said D’Artagnan, “you will find that my friend, Monsieur du Vallon, will go to the most fatal lengths if Cardinal Mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat; mutton every day.”
“Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!”
Nevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his wife with open arms.
Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital.”
He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart.
“And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?”
“Come,” he said, “you have me in a snare, gentlemen.
“I ask you what can I do?
She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.
Then she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.
Athos, on the other hand, reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by D’Artagnan.
The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that Château-Renaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion.
“Judge for yourself,” replied he.
“At what time you please, sir,” replied Franz.
How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice Chapter 62.
“Well, one day when she was hunting with her husband,” continued Athos, in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, “she fell from her horse and fainted.
“Leave me!” she exclaimed; “you are not a man!” and she went out of the room.
He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, “Why, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification?”
“The fact is,” said D’Artagnan, “if men are punished for imprudence and triviality, this poor king deserves punishment.
“Let us not mistake,” said Monte Cristo; “I love everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly hate but a few.
In fact, at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind.
And of what malady?”
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort’s lackey, and gave him his instructions.
A man of the count’s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior ones.
I set off for France, after having fixed upon the plan.
Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, “M.
The young man knelt down.
to hold for five minutes—the gates, they will be torn down, twisted into iron wire, ground to powder!
“The beginning or the end?”
“Now do you understand?” said Athos.
Then turning toward M. de Tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window, “Well, monsieur,” continued he, “you say it is his Eminence’s Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?”
He sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and reflected.
That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted the costume of my calling.”
“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse.
Shall we go together?”
They resolved to profit by the count’s courtesy, and ordered the horses to be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained.
As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations.
The footsteps—they were double—paused at the door—and Dantès guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him—this idea was soon converted into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier.
Several strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed him away from her.
Meanwhile, what are you going to do?”
“Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.
“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”
“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès made a gesture.
He was telling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that though I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for this.”
“That would be a misfortune,” said De Winter, “and I shall begin to think that we are really doomed.”
“Arrest the Duke!
“I do not know him, viscount.”
And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared, completely hidden between them.
“A person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?
His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.
“Oh, yes,” said Château-Renaud.
“Egad!
nonsense!” cried D’Artagnan, “I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well; I know an excellent method.”
“At La Réserve, the day before the betrothal feast.”
She bore me rapidly away.
“Yes, for I can follow you no farther, and I only stop at the foot of the scaffold.
He certainly likes the child, but will he love me less as his affection grows for her?”
“Come, sir,” said Comminges, “make haste; you must obey the king.”
Chapter LV.
“I am afraid to do so.
As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Héloïse to the letter,—donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and drove that same night to No.
Danglars was quite annoyed by the young man’s indifference.
“An enemy in my house, do you say, Edmond!
Milady looked at this man, and hesitated.
“My good, my brave Guitant, whatsoever command I may give you in that language—in French—whatever I may order you to do, will you not perform it?”
Let us talk of your happy return, my boy.
My profession condemns me to celibacy.
Athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.
Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for someone to show him his road, for it was quite dark.
They rose about eight o’clock in the winter, about six in summer, and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de Tréville’s.
Since you demand my resignation, I retire.”
Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every word that was said.
D’Avrigny took the priest’s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine’s room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers.
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
“Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?” said he, in the most natural tone in the world.
“But,” continued the porter, “he would not take them.”
“I have Tony, a safe if simple youth.”
“Of pale complexion and brown hair?”
Did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night?”
M. de Tréville had intimated to them his Majesty’s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and they must immediately prepare their outfits.
“His excellency did not charge me to purchase this house.
“Probably; and those steeples, pointed and sculptured, that we catch a glimpse of yonder, are similar to those that I have heard described at Chambord.”
“At all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair, gentlemen—an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained.”
“Yes.”
“You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman.”
I have committed no crime.
“Pardon, madame, but I think that either I have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me.
“No, but they mean to make a Fronde, as they call it,” said Guitant.
“Here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!
“I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but what is the matter?
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan, “it appears that I was more drunk than you, since I remember nothing of the kind.”
“500,000?” The same expression continued.
“They were indispensable.”
Milady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.
“Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right-hand correspondent was telegraphing——”
“Gentlemen,” said the queen, laughing, “pray take up your abode in the chateau; it is large, and there will be no want of room for you all; but, as we never thought of coming here, I am informed that there are, in all, only three beds in the whole establishment, one for the king, one for me——”
But you, my dear D’Artagnan?”
“I then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his accomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share his punishment.
Milady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast.
The boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on some distant point.
He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk.
“But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?”
“It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did not sooner assist you in your distress.
Each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea.
“My dear fellow,” replied Porthos, “to be candid with you, I am not happy.”
But when the cardinal added that not only Mme.
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which from any other person would have offended him, “I ride what I can get; I am not so proud as you.
“It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely answers me, and Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.”
Planchet alighted.
“And he knows the full casks,” said Blaisois, “for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier d’Artagnan.
The chieftain of the party drew near.
But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you the example.”
“And this elixir, where is it?
At this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone became mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain of the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.
“Presently!
“To leave you?”
d’Épinay,” said he, “allow me to remind you at this moment,—which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear, for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb,—allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her death-bed, that Valentine’s wedding might not be deferred.
Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words:
“Well, now then, the count?”
“Ah!
She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him.
The woman had the outline of Mme.
“Why should he understand this, my sister?
“If it is I whom your majesty interrogates,” replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner, “I reply that I hold monsieur le marechal’s opinion in every respect.”
“Alas!
friend,” cried Planchet.
“If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you—at dinner or supper, for instance?”
The king is alone with a few gentlemen, whom he fears to lose every day; surrounded by the Scotch, whom he distrusts, although he be himself a Scotchman.
At this moment the accuser concluded with these words: “The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English people.”
“What have you done?”
“We are very happy, monsieur,” replied Julie; “but we have also known unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves.”
“You are not boasting?”
This raillery exasperated Jussac.
“Certainly,” replied the officer, and left the room.
My poor brother was ignorant of this sentence.

Nobody knew.
He was, however, the same Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world, even against M.

But I dined at M. de Villefort’s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners.
“The rascal is rich, then?”
‘If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond, he will inform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoni?—in all probability we shall never see him.’
“And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?” said Beauchamp in a calm tone.
“A woman whom I don’t know, but who is called Milady.”
As to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his hands.
“Good,” thought the Gascon, “this is a promising beginning.”
“Yes,” said Athos, “doubtless you would commit great follies!
The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn.
The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table supported on lions’ claws.
Chapter LVIII.
“Ah, yes,” said the factitious abbé, who began to understand; “and what name does the young man bear meanwhile?”

The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I cannot comprehend.”
Meanwhile what of Mercédès?

“No.”
“Pardon me, excellency,” said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker’s shoulder; “people pay here before they eat.
“Here they are.”
“Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so well?”
“That is a Spanish name, I think?”
You should have allowed me to sleep.
Aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his doublet.
Whilst all this was going on, Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg St. Antoine.
D’Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever.
If they were not yet to be seen, it was because the road made an elbow.
He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow.
On quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right, and entered the reception room.
The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom; and D’Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not fail to make a sensation.
The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal entirely.
“Oh!
“Ah, Caderousse,” said Andrea, “how covetous you are!
That day the minister’s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill-humor.

At all events, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court.
“Where am I to die?” said she.
On arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers, who seemed to know every possible password; for they walked without either guide or escort, and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them, who instantly let them pass with evident deference, due probably to their high birth.
Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy.
“She was dead?”
Why was I a prisoner?”
He had just completed this monologue—which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue—when the servant-maid, watching at the door, suddenly cried out:

“That Milady’s son has left England, that he is in France, on his road to Paris, if he be not here already.”

M. d’Épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have anticipated him in this announcement.”
Now suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at the fourth remove, is served up at your table.

A Conjugal Scene
“Oh, this is too much,” cried Milady.
“This means, sire,” replied the cardinal, “that I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to offer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept them.”
And why so?” asked Porthos, warmly.
Although General d’Épinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain royalist sentiments?
“What should you do in my place?”
The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but Felton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer, he said, “A pressing message from Lord de Winter.”
“Mercédès,” said Caderousse eagerly.
Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but purely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica, my first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect, should be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find them; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.”
“My friend,” said D’Artagnan, turning to the servant, “tell his eminence that in half an hour I shall be at his command.”

Then, turning to Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her.
“My lords,” answered he, “it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in obscurity; it is immediately, and by a thunderbolt, that I must repel the flash of lightning which, for a moment, startled me.
Will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the Duc de la Trémouille, and that they did not endeavor to burn it?—which would not, perhaps, have been a great misfortune in time of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of Huguenots, but which is, in time of peace, a frightful example.
“My God, can you not remember her name?”
I remember, just at his age, how deep in love I was with a Grecian statue which our good king, then Henry IV., gave my father, insomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story of Pygmalion was nothing but a fable.”

It was time.
Morrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed his brother-in-law’s gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt equal inward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his countenance.
“Ah, he is one who fears neither God nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service.”
Was it an entire army?
“Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has happened.”

And for whom—for some _grisette_, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in some garrison?
What is life to you?—Nothing.
The count, in taking leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he answered, “Willingly, count; I accept.” The count returned to young Morcerf.

“Wait, your reverence, there is a letter.”
I shall come back to dessert; keep me some strawberries, coffee, and cigars.

“Yesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor.”
I hope that you will sometimes, too, think of me, and if at certain hours you should miss me, if you should feel any slight regret at my absence, I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself, and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you.”
There they are.
“Keep back, my lord,” said D’Artagnan.
Nobody knows you.
This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porthos.
“I promise.” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner who reassured him.
“Yes; I.”
The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and his hand, under his coat, tore his breast.

“I do not jest,” said Athos.
Once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear.

My offers did not arouse him,—did not even tempt him.”
Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master, grumbling.
“Yes,” continued the duke, “really, I feel bored today beyond the power of description.”
To the questions which D’Artagnan put concerning her health, she replied, “Bad, very bad.”
Yes, he checks his pace; he stops at the gate; he rings.”
“He shall receive them on returning from the mayor’s20.”
“Alas,” said Valentine, restraining her tears, “my grandfather is dead.”
Danglars reflected for a moment.
“At your service, sir,” he continued.
The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court, was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal.
“At the age of five years!” said the major with a deep sigh, and raising his eye to heaven.
“Rich?
“And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God!
Bonacieux.
“You also!” exclaimed the executioner, “you use that word which sounds ever in my ears—‘assassinated!’ I have assassinated, then, and not executed!
Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage.”
The abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.
Dantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he detected, the ingenious artifice.
Think, if I am found out here, the people of the house, who have not seen me enter it, will take me for a thief.”
The eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound, giving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water.
“And then,” said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and with effort, to get away from her thoughts, “however skilfully it is prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it does not escape the eye of God.
Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything.
I swear by—”
“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.
On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of Meung, in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born, appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just made a second La Rochelle of it.
“How did they act with regard to the Maréchale d’Ancre?” cried the king, in the highest state of choler; “first her closets were thoroughly searched, and then she herself.”
She was lost in reverie, and the reverie of crime is remorse.
“Well, I know of ten such men.”
His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers.
“He is quite right,” returned Beauchamp; “for I criticise him without knowing what he does.

I promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;” then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say, “Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy,” and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, Villefort departed with paradise in his heart.
Once for all, Tréville had placed his stable at D’Artagnan’s service.
This league was directed against France.

“It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longueville.”
This, with my Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.”
“Yes.”
“Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, forward!” cried Athos.
“You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.”
“Dear, excellent friend,” murmured Albert, still burning the papers.
“My lord,” said Athos, “we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused, in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill, in so much pain.”
D’Artagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity.
Mazarin, clever politician as he was, was for once mistaken; Broussel was a thing, not a name.
We were but the instruments, that is all.”
“Very well.
“On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.”
He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the family, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme.
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice, “Let the justice of God be done!” and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which closed over it.
All four were to meet the next day at eleven o’clock.
“I was blind; Athos has made me see, that’s all; come here.”
D’Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.
The king threw himself into an arm-chair.
“The duke is English; the duke fights against us.
“What think you of it?” inquired Athos.
Cardinal, I must have the queen’s papers.”
“For the sake of being a count.
“Ah!
“Do you wish to see me again?”
...the caves of the small
I, of course, give him the same title, and everyone else does likewise.”
“Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your Majesty.

“He is saved!
The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour.
Come, let us see what you will do for me.”
“I think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.” Madame de Saint-Méran heard her.
“The history is a sad one, sir,” said Caderousse, shaking his head; “perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?”
He pardoned, and having pardoned he remained.
Milady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.
A burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon; the air burned, ignited by flaming embers, then the frightful lightning disappeared, the brands sank, one after another, into the abyss, where they were extinguished, and save for a slight vibration in the air, after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened.
“Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,” said Monte Cristo; “what are you doing here, at such an hour?”
“Has only hastened their flight; in ten minutes they will perhaps be here.”
“Be sure I shall not fail to do so,” returned the count, bowing.
“Well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him twice.”
“Did he send you?”
I knight you, monsieur le comte.”
What has happened?” asked the countess, as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life; “did you say a misfortune?
“Yes, but let us understand each other,” returned Athos, seriously.
“_Pardieu_, he has come to draw, but I don’t know how much!”
“Oh, I take everything on myself.
“Your age?” repeated the president.
“Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that is all.
The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder.
“Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident.

and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”
“Because,” said Albert, laughing, “one piece of news follows another, and there is often great dissimilarity between them.”
“Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given.”
Why, in passing through Lilliers you will send me your chaise, with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal.”
A terrible cry was heard, and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people; the latter knew that this officer, who was so pale, but who appeared so determined, would keep his word; they continued to threaten, but they began to disperse.
And he took his friend along the alley, where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds, were visible.
He thought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor.
_Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento_.
“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek this good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to lament it.
“Whom do you mean?”
The hinges yielded in their turn and fell, still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest was open.
“You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.”
Then I have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees.
“Yes, before others,” replied the doctor; “but now we are alone——”
“This is where the mad abbé was kept, sir, and that is where the young man entered;” and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained unclosed.
There came a sound like a whirlwind, at the same time two troops of horsemen, each composed of ten men, sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded D’Artagnan and Planchet.
Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh, threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it.
“At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?” asked Penelon.
It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it.
But in that same banker’s study, where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady, that many things may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not marry.
“Of the ‘Arabian Nights’.”
It’s my Spanish wine that has got into your head, is it not?
As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo.
“Yes,” said the executioner.
Here is what the letter contained:
“Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found in my coat—that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring—when I opened the door, and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly shrieked.
“To horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.”
But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens, who, seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed, would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence.
“Yes,” replied the count, “and you confirmed the report.
“Why?”
“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.
From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything.”
‘I thought we agreed for the price I asked.’
“It is only five minutes past eight,” said he to Morrel; “there is not much time lost yet.”
So now, you are both forewarned.”
“But suppose we all go,” said D’Artagnan; “what the devil!
“Hello, Grimaud!
“What is his name?”
Chapter L. The Interview.
“Here is your chamber for tonight,” said he.
He proposed the conditions—the two harnesses, either against one horse or a hundred pistoles.
Where were we?”
“Oh, my king,” said Parry, with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication, “do not look to the left as we leave the hall.”
Dantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.
Now I cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me, on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite useless, and cannot be legally exercised.”
“I will go,” continued Maximilian, “I will seek M. Franz d’Épinay—I am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort’s absence—and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me.” Noirtier’s look continued to interrogate.
The count stood alone, and at a sign from his hand, the carriage went on for a short distance.
“In two hours’ time,” said he, “these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs.
“Her Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor.”

I was rocked when an infant in the arms of old Ocean, and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite; I have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other; I love the sea as a mistress, and pine if I do not often see her.”
“Then, if he should forget that visit, you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it?”
Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of God!
“And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?” cried Morcerf; “it was for him that you obtained pardon?”
“‘A soldier of the usurper, then?’
“This very instant.”
D’Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names.
No, I did not say I was a stranger to you.
M. Noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify ‘yes,’ and to wink when he means ‘no.’ You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with M. Noirtier;—try.”
“Yes; what do you think of her?”
He called it using his advantages.
In fact, aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre, no one appeared to be aware that Charles I. had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold.
“Humph,” said the major; “very good.
“Just so.”
“Precisely so,” cried Monte Cristo—“precisely so; and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte.
Grief had made her blind to all but one object—that was Edmond.
A sort of smile played on his lips.
“That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels.

Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand, which she as usual raised to her lips.

On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men, holding a lantern in his hand.
“What is it?”

“So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!” said Danglars.
“You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that subject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.”
‘Ah, Assunta,’ cried I, ‘you are an excellent woman, and Heaven will bless you.’”
Athos arose.
I have proof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served her.”
“You have, then, a repugnance to your profession?”
Milady saw the trouble.
Chapter XLII.

“That’s better,” cried the abbé; “now we are on the right scent.
“Courage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to the queen.”
“A quarrel?” asked Athos.
“Who?
That man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so.
D’Artagnan advanced.
“That’s true; but is this little woman, then, to escape his Eminence?”
a little sooner or a little later, it isn’t worth quarreling over.”
You have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between us.”
“Stay a moment, your excellency,” said Peppino, rising; “you still owe me something.”
In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby.
D’Artagnan burst out laughing at the idea.
Then you were going to Rueil?”
“Because—I scarcely know why—but it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not choose openly to oppose it.”
“And it has staggered everybody.
“We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life.”
“Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person?
“Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,” returned Signor Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat; “I will do all I can, and I hope you will be satisfied.”
I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight, sword in hand.”
“Sir,” said the notary, “how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?” The old man gave no answer.
Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty?

“I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to walk about; but I wish to see the governor.”
“I am, as I trust you do not doubt, your devoted
He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open.
Nature subdued must yield in the combat, the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream.
“I thank you, madame,” said he, “for the deference you have shown to my wishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to you.”
D’Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day Milady gave him a more gracious reception.
Ah!
The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes.
Six Arabs came up, full gallop, to cut off my head.
Devoted men are so rare, Tréville, by the back staircase.

She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes.
And he caused himself to be announced to the minister.
“She will soon pass; she is already late.

The closet into which D’Artagnan and Porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing-room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only, and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room, whilst the aperture between the two hangings, small as it was, permitted them to see.

“He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.”
Only, during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of deceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of emigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance.

“My dear M. Debray,” said the banker, “do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.”
“King’s attorney?” said the president, stupefied, and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; “king’s attorney?”
“I understand,” said the duke.
Oh, you are so kind, and I am so grateful!”
The Office of the King’s Attorney
“No,” replied Morcerf, “my father is most anxious about it; and I hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my betrothed—Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.”
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps crime.”
The commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his papers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with.
A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.
Next moment D’Artagnan entered.
Adieu.”
And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you say of him?
“Perhaps he would accept.”
She had still four days before her.
“Pooh!” replied D’Artagnan.
She will not hear what we say; she never goes to bed before midnight.”
“My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.
“Oh, well, he will add, ‘We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the same Christian name.’”
I do not know you.”
The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat.

Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.
“Yes,” interposed Porthos, “four hundred pistoles; but who is to make four hundred pistoles?”
“What did you please to say, sir?” asked Caderousse.
Mousqueton sighed again, more deeply than before.
Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him, he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon.
“Now,” replied Monte Cristo “there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father’s mind, which is this—he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him, how you have been treated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank.
“It is of no use for you to know anything about it,” said the young woman, whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back.
Bazin!
“Silence!” said Porthos.
So they made this song about her: ‘_Laboissiere, dis moi_.’ You know it, don’t you?”
Night came, and at ten o’clock they anchored.

I think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement.”
“Here,” said she, “you see I have thought of everything; with this cloak you will not be cold.”
“What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar!”
“Has he perceived anything?”
I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able to accomplish it,” said the unknown with a singular smile; “and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.”
“Oh!
The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.”
“Now, monsieur,” he said to Raoul, “will you give me the letter you have brought?”
These gardeners are the most careless people in the world; in bringing the horse out to the water they’ve allowed him to walk over the border.”
He was induced to undertake this journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either, by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop.
“D’Artagnan,” he said, “you are here to-night, still infuriated by yesterday’s adventure.
An expression of intense joy illumined the old man’s eyes.
He hastened to the side-door with Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the servants’ staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty, contained its chief occupant.
Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob.
D’Artagnan was a physiognomist.
“Well.”
Even if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you to pass.
“Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!”
He then took his cane, which he had placed against an old cupboard, and went out.
Come, who is my father?”
50085m
The palace was surrounded with water, but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls; and the only difference was, that instead of entering by the doors, people entered by the windows.
“But, tell me,” said Andrea, “am I to remain bareheaded?”
“Stay,” said Mazarin, drawing the ring from his finger, “my dear D’Artagnan, there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly, it is but just it should return to you; take it, I pray.”
“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”
“Help,” cried Caderousse; “I am murdered!”
These active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor; these were the beggars of the Court of Miracles—the agents of the giver of holy water in the Square of Saint Eustache, preparing barricades for the morrow.
The minister made a slight sign with his head, whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais:
“Sir,” replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, “I warn you, when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, I kill it; and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime, I believe I do society a kindness.
“And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button-hole.”
The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.
He then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything; but as the banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice of it.
Franz bowed and left the room.
I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my brother!
I don’t speak of my brother.
“His voice went to my heart,” observed Julie; “and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before.”
Monsieur Aramis, become a poet, I beg of you.”
You will be able to indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of mine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.”
This letter was from my brother.
“Come along!
“An amateur headsman,” replied Aramis, “who however, does not handle the axe amiss.”
Request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served in her apartments.
40150m
Château-Renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane.
He continued to follow the path to the glade; but, to his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself.
Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.
This time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone.
“She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she not?”
And this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night.”
“The Count de Rochefort?”
“He saw that it was a merciless war between us—a war to the death.
Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them?”
“My very self,” replied Planchet; “but I wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud.”
Indeed, almost before the door opened, the scene changed.
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot.
It is running now.”
You are ambitious—it is natural; you are a man of genius and you know your worth.
I cannot stay here any longer.”
Several times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed, without response.
He thought that voice more feeble than usual.
The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife.
“Very true, but you introduced me at M. Danglars’.”
They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck, defining the forms of shadows behind it.
As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin, which was answered by one, equally furtive, from the minister.
“That which was given to me, assuredly.
“I was mistaken,” said the host, “he’s not quite dumb.
Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.”
Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table, on which were arranged music, drawings, and vases of flowers.
“And so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou wine?” said Porthos.
The young count’s conversation was most interesting to Raoul, therefore he listened much, whilst the count talked well and long.
Mazarin sprang forward.
Noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.
“Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.
You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly.”
Fernand Mondego, Count of Morcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.”
“Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.”
“You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances.”
“Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen.”
And the queen advanced to meet the messenger, whose hand she seized affectionately, whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her, contained in a case of gold.
Benedetto rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool.”
“Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on.”
But will you be able to follow me?”
“Ready money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to make sacrifices.
Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other.
“No; be easy.”
She told D’Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law, and not her brother.
“I had forgotten that England was an island, and that you were the king of it.”
D’Artagnan’s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion; he began to think he had to do with madmen.
Madame, wait at the door, whilst I shall be at the head of the king’s bed, ready to die for him.”
“_Ma foi_, I should like to smoke.”
my friend!
England is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which, I greatly fear, blood alone can exorcise.”
Franz remained with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the same mourning-coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil.
Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them, that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and, availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the Italian theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess.
“She was his mother.”
“And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?”
“Hum!” said Gondy, laughing; “I was not aware my alms were so well invested.”
“To be sure.
In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best.
“I am not an abbé, I am not mad; perhaps I shall be, but at present, unfortunately, I am not.
In all probability, therefore, the Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as “Sinbad the Sailor,” but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.
Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that God, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned.”
“Therefore, madame, I ask you to look, not among your friends of to-day, but among those of other times.”
With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold.
“What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what do you mean?
Four years ago, Penelon was at Trieste—Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener—Penelon, when he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September.
“What do you say?” inquired Charles, rising.
“Take care,” said Madame de Villefort, “the king’s attorney is here.”
The horse started, brushed against the imprudent man, who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest, and he fell against the wall.
“But what are we to do?”
“My name must rest unknown,” replied Franz; “merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for pleasure.”
“If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized, for fear it might be thought I knew him.”
You must die.’”
“How, sirrah!
“Thank you, count—thank you,” said the young man, evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation; “yes, everyone in my family is well.”
But I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo here.”
Skirmishing.
“Ah,” cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy.
“In her room with the notary.”
That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.
Baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.
None of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion.
But Aramis was livid.
It was evident that he shared his master’s apprehensions.
“I will go—I will go!”
“I was sure of it—the cursed letter!”
“Ah,” exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly leaping in excess of love, “you see he has not forgotten me, for here he is!” And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, “Here, Edmond, here I am!”
“And now, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” he said, “prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the queen.”
They were making nearly ten knots an hour.
Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior.
“Very well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles.”
I thought so; but we will return to my Lord Duke presently.
If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours you prefer, and in this respect your wishes will be complied with.”
I guessed it!
“The owner of the _Pharaon_ and patron of Dantès.”
“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner; “I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”
“I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond’s favor.
This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead.
He ran along the high road, took the path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the boatman.
Queer, though.
“Approach him,” said she, “and when the next waiter passes, insist upon his taking something.”
“To poison.”
If, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man.
Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud, for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river.
“I learned so much at Marseilles,” replied the abbé, making a strong effort to appear indifferent; “but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès, I was unable to obtain any particulars of his end.
Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand.
The marines were removed.
“And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?”
“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars.
There was the crime, Bertuccio—that was where you became really culpable.”
“Prince Cavalcanti,” said the latter; “Prince Cavalcanti, where are you?”
He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face.
D’Artagnan put the gold in his hat, and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos, each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis.
“On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,” said Albert absently.
“Briefly, what did you learn?”
If Richelieu made the king, by comparison, seem small, he made royalty great.
“Yes,” said he, “yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen.
“So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you?
“No, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched him, and he determined to take orders.”
“I doubt it, Planchet,” replied D’Artagnan, “but what are you thinking of?”
But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?—he will do everything wrong.”
Be reasonable.
The presence of the two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses.
“The house, as I said, is between the court and the garden; in this way, do you see?” Andrea drew the garden, the court and the house.
Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have perceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me sad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and since, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart with one of his life-giving rays.
EXECUTION
But listen, Porthos: though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised, Mazarin is not less strong than he, and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him.
You will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris.
“Ah, _ma foi!_ who is to know?”
“Indeed!”
They will believe he is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell them who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.’”
On the other side of the house, to match with the library, was the conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in china jars; and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to sight and smell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth.
“Are you then come from M. de Morcerf’s?” asked Monte Cristo.
“Nobody.”
After the reward of his devotion, that of his love was to come.
Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future.
Chapter 57.
THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS
Besides, you forget that I have a ring likewise.”
“Your excellency, it is done already.
And she resumed her seat, as if plunged in reflections entirely personal.
“Just as you please, gentlemen, provided we set sail,” he said.
He was then only fifteen feet from the ground, as the gentlemen below had told him.
“I understand.
At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before.
“Truly,” cried the host, “misfortune is coming on our house; it is the former executioner of Bethune.”
“Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts;” and Caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time:
Chapter XII.
“Well, while I was watching—not the king, as monsieur le comte thinks, for I know what it is to see a man led to death, and though I ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill—while I was watching the masked executioner, the idea came to me, as I said, to find out who he was.
“It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants, dozens and dozens of them.”
“Count, I have your word,” said Morrel coldly; then taking out his watch, he added, “It is half-past eleven.”
“And so, sir,” said the queen, “you are seriously afraid of a public tumult.”
He had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning; he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room—the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal—so that he might have the pleasure of hanging Mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish.
There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.
“Perhaps so.
It was half-past nine o’clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop’s palace to the tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie.
The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit.
“And I,” said Porthos, “shall make him my sole heir.”
The king went away enchanted.
D’Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.
“He went to desire you to come to the palace.
Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase; the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all, and the bargain was concluded; Madeleine’s brother entered D’Artagnan’s service.
Upon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown and slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.
“Well, what would you have me do?” said the major.
“Pray, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, after a minute, “either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections that I shall have no head to converse with you.
“Ah!
I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure one.”
The recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all Paris.
“Upon my word,” cried Albert, “you must have been a very entertaining companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead!
“Oho!” said he, “what is this?
This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of Notre Dame, and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment; but when at last the regiment separated, penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe, near the Rue Cocatrix, in which Broussel lived, then Friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast; and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day, he reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the cost of this repast.
“One may see that you love your family, Madame Coquenard,” said the procurator, with a smile that was almost tragic.
I paused, but I had already drunk half a glass.
I like everyone.”
“I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice.
Did you come here to fetch me?
He had not heard a carriage stop in the street, or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly.
I arose.
Awakened in the night by the light of the flames, she sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown, and attempted to escape by the door, but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames.
“I ask you only how your engagement stands?
Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.
The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd, who for the sake of gain styled him “your excellency.” As Danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron, he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency, and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars, who were ready, for twelve more, to call him “your highness.”
“That’s all right, Edmond.
Porthos seemed to breathe more freely.
“Ah, you are his son!” he said; “that is a different thing.”
Still further, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great, diminished day by day.
Athos reflected for an instant.
“Oh, yes!”
“Nevertheless——”
At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, “Come, nothing is lost; I am still beautiful.”
Monte Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for an explanation.
Well, let me see, what can you want that begins with N?
“Well,” said Athos, “that only makes four; and we are four—one for one.
My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and the memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our country, because you were born not far from Marseilles.”
This time, without knowing why, D’Artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins.
“Eating what?” said D’Artagnan.
The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare, and kneeling down, kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse.
D’Artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task.
At the bottom of that staircase lies, probably, the cardinal’s treasury of which folk tell such wonders, and we should only have to descend, empty a chest, shut the cardinal up in it, double lock it, go away, carrying off as much gold as we could, put back this orange-tree over the place, and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from—not even the cardinal.”
What can the chancellor have to say to me that your Majesty could not say yourself?”
There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”
“May the devil take me, if the child be not dead,” said Porthos.
“But consider the matter seriously, Eugénie!”
“Friend,” said Athos, “our resolution is irrevocable.”
“Let us do better than that,” said Athos; “do not let us leave him during the whole evening.
Hush, we are flying!’ I did not understand.
“Stop there!” cried the Jesuit, “for that thesis touches closely upon heresy.
At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot.
“Sign it!” continued the count.
Suddenly D’Artagnan touched something warm, which moved.
“Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.”
“Do you know, my friend, I find one thing very evident in all this, you distrust me.”
A crowd of masks flowed in from all sides, emerging from the doors, descending from the windows.
Does your Majesty require anything further?
“Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.” Danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart.
“Do not deceive yourself.
And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o’clock, an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests, consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _Pharaon_, and other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the occasion.
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, “A thousand pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you deliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death.”
The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money otherwise.”
“But what attached him to the cause?
When she wakes she can sup.” And he made some steps toward the door.
But his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion.
“Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will thank you for it!”
He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land.
“What is the matter, if you please?”
Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him?
“I should think so, indeed!
“A hundred crowns.”
“‘Well,’ replied the traveller, who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer, ‘if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.’
Next moment the door opened and the man disappeared.”
“Very well; you are always the same, Athos, great and generous.
“That would be contrary to all custom.”
The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face.
Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, “Is this true?”
To the tender eye of a father or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine’s condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep.
“My God, how agitated you seem!”
Having staggered as far as the Rue Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions, and pointed towards the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the carriage drove on.
“Your feet, too,” said Grimaud.
I had no hope of getting off so easily.”
Give your orders, and we will execute them.”
a horse!” he cried; “I have found a horse!”
“Then you don’t believe me?”
Why, in the first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?”
“Ah, monseigneur, do not mention it!” cried the host, in the most pitiable voice imaginable.
“The _Pharaon_, sir—they signal the _Pharaon_!
“He’s not a guest like the other one here just now,” observed mine host to Olivain, who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything, “and your young master has no appetite.”
In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring.”
50271m
“It is surely not one of my friends?” replied D’Artagnan, affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant.
It is because, at your theatres, by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see persons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring, and fall dead instantly.
“Suppose I refuse?”
Albert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the first line, and seized the paper.
“No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where, I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain.

On my honor, they are not poisoned.
A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d’Avrigny; he left M. Noirtier, and returned to the sick man.

The curtain rose on the ballet, which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art—one of those masterly productions of grace, method, and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_, from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of volition, influenced the moving mass.

The queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter, who, kissing it respectfully, went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large, dark and deserted apartments, brushing away tears which, blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier, he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified, yet so intense.
“Why, monsieur, very ill indeed!
“Bear witness that we have done all that we could.”
Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him.

Then only D’Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had disdained the _soubrette_.
“I go to-morrow, my friend,” replied D’Artagnan.
Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention.

we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.”
It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another.”
Porthos seized his opportunity, caught the next soldier by his neck, gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room, and entered after him.

Until now, it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn.
“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars.
Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies.
“And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation,” replied D’Artagnan, in a low voice, “I beg you to follow me.”
Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him, while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult.

In truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature—from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts crowded with guards—from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising from the streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the room, which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing—let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to the guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais Royal, that the people were possessed of arms.

First, you purchase a house at Auteuil—this house is the one where I have committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child.
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered, Cromwell did not move.

D’Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer’s uniform in every street of the camp.

What’s to be done?”

Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!”
“But, in a word, what are you going to do?” asked she.

At one moment, bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light, which illumined the sea for the space of a league, they might each be seen, each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which, even in their hearts of bronze, they could not help experiencing.
The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions D’Artagnan had conceived.
what design can I have?”

“Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I don’t know where he is.”
As ten o’clock was striking, D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, who thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot of the stairs, D’Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane.

Albert led him first to his _atelier_, which was, as we have said, his favorite apartment.
“They want to arrest Master Broussel!” he cried; “the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs!”

Dantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph.

I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged.”
She made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses; only she did not respond to them.
But the man in the dark could not find the right key.

Edward endured the accident with miraculous courage—he did not utter a single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over.
“No one.”

What the deuce can you expect?
“Perhaps,” said one of the previous speakers, “as he was a churchman, they may go to some expense in his behalf.”
Now, as D’Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him, he announced himself.
“The Marquis of Saint-Méran.
“Oh, I don’t say that; your excellency will do as you please; I should be sorry to advise you in the matter.”
“And that will not be long, it is to be hoped,” said Porthos; “for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes.

And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal.
“The evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was this darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it.

He began as you begin.
At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a ray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to control himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips, and went out.
“Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.

The pretty Mme.
His gravity made him look older than he was.”
And D’Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.

The dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and this time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.”
“Bah!” cried Porthos.
They set out, passing over the Pont Neuf; they pursued their way along the quay then called L’Abreuvoir Pepin, and went along by the walls of the Grand Chatelet.
The night was quiet enough.
Aramis and I are very unhappy; but God, our courage, and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us.
“I am not speaking,” said the duke with a smile, “of the persons who are here; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely; I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.”
“Not to me, I hope?”
This was, in fact, a custom familiar to him.
Gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made their appearance—we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp, accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in literature, or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles, less owing to his social position than to his personal merit.

“Why does not he go about his business?”
don’t be a coward, or I shall cut off your ears.
Perceiving M. de Tréville at a distance—
“‘Danglars.’”
I am afraid for the king’s safety; place yourself close to the coach door on the right.”

“He died.”
de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us, doubtless intending to frighten us to death.”
Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated.
Come and watch by the dead, and all the wretched family will be grateful to you.”

I am cold, I am hungry.
“Save the queen!” cried Mazarin to the coadjutor.
Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared.
He knows my tastes, my caprices, my wants.
“_Scendi!_” exclaimed a commanding voice.
“That is right; I recommend the cardinal to your attention.”
Now then, go, go, in the name of heaven!

The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier d’Herblay; two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul, but Aramis protected him with his sword.

When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue.
Albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haydée at this moment; she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror.
“When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as a woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me a man’s passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have added with my own hand, ‘travelling with his sister.’”
A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.
The steward wished to turn to the left.
A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who had cried out “Courage!” held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.
The Duc de Chatillon commanded the centre.
“Oh, mon Dieu!
The others followed.
“Whose, then?

The lady always left first, and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away, sometimes towards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief.
Scarron was heated, the cold seized on him, and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled.
“I will tell him that.”
Blaisois, a tall, simple youth, who understood nothing but what he was expressly told, asked, therefore for the Abbé d’Herblay, and in spite of Bazin’s assurances that his master was not at home, he persisted in such a manner as to put Bazin into a passion.
“I will be there.”
“The lady had a cavalier shut up with her,” said Athos, “but as notwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to be presumed that he is a coward.”
I would then rather die.”
With a thousand pistoles one may face everything.
“Is he then advancing on Paris?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal.
Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly.
“But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy?”
“And you are breaking your promise!” interrupted Monte Cristo.
Some day, when the world is much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature, to serve for the general good of humanity; when mankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the secrets of death, then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved.”
You said, ‘only imagine,’—and then paused.
I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my enemy.
The child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion.
This was the chance at which M. de Tréville waited for the king.

D’Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion, continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him greatly.
A few locks of gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics.
“No; I do not wish to come between a father and son.
My ideas are never so clear as when I have had plenty of wine.
The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and showed Dantès the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.
“That is to say, madame—”
“From the Abbé Busoni?”
His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of professed superiority—in fact, the application of the axiom, _Pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the Greeks, “Know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our days, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_.
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated—I care very little about that!
Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen.
“Then, on the honor of a Mazarin, as I am and ever shall be, I hope,” said the cardinal.
“At one o’clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.”
Mousqueton will lose another, that’s five; and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league.”
“Yes,” continued the curate, apparently accustomed to this tone, “yes, we wish to know your opinion of the events of to-day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church.”
On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected.
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort.
These horsemen were our friends, or rather, an avant garde, composed of D’Artagnan and Athos.
he may desire to become my heir, and re...
He will do anything I wish.
“If anyone comes, call me.”
In the most simple and natural manner possible.
“Six o’clock.”
“And who has seen this _fleur-de-lis?_” inquired Aramis.
The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters.
Take him out and shoot him.”
“Willingly.”
“Oh, sir, reply, I entreat you—is not the Comte de la Fere a noble whom I remember, handsome and brave, a musketeer under Louis XIII., who must be now about forty-seven or forty-eight years of age?”
“Nearly nine years.”
See, here it is.”
“Then he is not dead?”
Coquenard’s chamber; they were heartrending.
And heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and Florence by the way of Aquapendente!
“And the king has seen the cardinal?” asked M. de Tréville.
And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, “The _Pharaon_, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.” She was the exact duplicate of the other _Pharaon_, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and indigo.
The notary then prepared to retire.
The sergeant, with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity, said:
Then, turning to Monte Cristo,—“I hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,” continued she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a lateral alley.
“Madame,” said Athos, passing his arm under that of D’Artagnan, “we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman.
Milady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.
if Mousqueton were here!
“I love most fondly—I love madly—I love as a man who would give his life-blood to spare her a tear—I love Valentine de Villefort, who is being murdered at this moment!
Planchet turned and returned the billet.
The guests now all took leave of Athos, excepting the old Duc de Barbe, who, as an old friend of the family of La Valliere, went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage.
Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances, not men.
I own that this woman terrifies me.”
“_Pardieu!_ it was the most simple thing in the world.
In a corner was the Spanish companion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid.
“Well?”
“What?
d’Avrigny, who attends my mother, declares he is in despair about it.
As for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.
“Well, then, I repeat, you are wrong.
“We may go, then?” asked the queen.
The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work.
and has visited with me, that is, in...
As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and how it set sail.
“Ah, reverend sir,” cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo, “I may indeed say you are my deliverer!”
But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not acquainted.
They waited upwards of ten minutes.
“Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,” cried Valentine; “but there is one thing I wish to know.”
“It was I,” said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; “and it was time, for you were sinking.”
And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the trophies of their victory.
D’Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind D’Artagnan the door was guarded.
“I mean,” said Albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing Cavalcanti, who stood with his back towards the fireplace—“I mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes; that will be sufficient—where two men having met, one of them will remain on the ground.”
“Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his actions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know of him.
“Without doubt,” replied the Jesuit.
“Bertuccio!”
“Now pass your arm through this opening.”
“But really——” said D’Artagnan.
“And since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what happened there.
Finally, Athos undertook to provide, in any event, the means of leaving England—in case either of failure or of success.
“Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”
And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder.
“And for me?” put in Porthos.
“He certainly bodes us no good,” said Athos; “but let us embark; once out at sea, let him come.”
“My dear Blacas,” said the king, “you with your alarms prevent me from working.”
But tell me, count, will your people take care of my horse?”
“Alas!” said Felton, looking at those beautiful hands, and shaking his head sorrowfully.
“I do not know.
“Yes.
“It is my fault, madame,” said Raoul.
“Fair,” said Athos, “is she not?”
D’Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood, finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarin’s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister’s finger that night.
At the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side doors, and rushed upon Athos.
If we are attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the sea.
“Oh, where will be the end?”
“Oh, dear mother, it was a dream.”
“Penelon,” replied Julie, “go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman’s visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.”
‘Yes, monsieur, the one with which I gather my fruit.’ ‘Lend it to us, and go into your house again; there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you.
“You are Monsieur d’Artagnan?”
For all evils there are two remedies—time and silence.
“Poor things!”
“Alas!” exclaimed Mercédès, “if it were so, if I possessed free-will, but without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive me to despair.”
what mean you by that?”
“I do not like Auteuil, sir,” said the procureur, making an evident effort to appear calm.
The answer was terrible.
“I had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the _Arabian Nights_, a wizard of the Middle Ages; but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence.
What can have happened, then, to Bragelonne?”
“This,” said Monte Cristo, “is less correct than your philosophy,—it is only faith.”
I feigned a criminal process, and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her.
Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm.
“Listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,—he attributes his father’s misfortunes to you.”
“Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me.”
“Well, I will mention you to him.
“Monsieur de Flamarens?”
But D’Artagnan remained impassible.
“Yes, yes; but let us go.
You have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs, Valentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is happiness that awaits us.”
Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him.
“Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight?”
“Shall you see the king again?”
“_Dentro la testa_,” replied the same voice, with the same menacing accent.
“The devil!” said Aramis.
“But why is my grandfather allowed to live?”
He traversed the island, after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-embarked for Marciana.
What do you think, D’Artagnan?” said Athos.
“Zounds!
“What?
“Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?”
“In the name of heaven, madame,” said Villefort, “where is the doctor?
“No, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.”
All five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their way to the town of Béthune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped before the first inn they came to.
My first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it, taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock.
And such magnificent hair!
for instance, the former servingman of some brave gentleman, an enemy himself to Mazarin, as every gentleman ought to be.”
“Onward!” cried Porthos.
They poured a little rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him, produced the same effect as formerly.
“Come,” said the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, “not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o’clock tomorrow morning.”
“I am finishing the most execrable morning’s work.”
But M. de Tréville knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of the queen’s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful.
“Monseigneur, I see well that I must call Grimaud.”
“A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.”
And so they descended the private stair, Mazarin leaning on the arm of D’Artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling.
“No, but in the one next to it, and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing.
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill.
“Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “I understand you.
The man, who had the appearance of being a butcher, descended a little steep and isolated street, looking on to the river, with two of his friends.
Oh!
“_Ma foi!_” he said, “I prefer waiting till tomorrow.
“Ah, that is really original,” said Beauchamp.
“Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,” returned Albert.
“Sir,” he said, “I can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty.
Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation.
it is the Hotel Rambouillet,” cried Guitant.
“It seems to me, however,” said Mazarin, “the safest method.”
And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?”
“Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?”
Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man, and at times gave it the appearance of life.
“He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed.” And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchet’s adventure.
“Not I, unfortunately!” said Porthos.
The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole, and saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès.
The women had already fled, taking refuge in Vitry; only a few men remained.
“Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?”
I thought I had quite,” said Groslow.
“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”
D’Artagnan, on his side, went up to the landlady, praised her wine—which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil—and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village; one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris, and was at that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville; the other was a convent of Jesuits and was the property—a by no means unusual circumstance—of these worthy fathers.
“What is that?” asked Aramis.
Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other suspected of Bonapartism.
The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point.
“But do you think we shall find the count at home?”
“You would do so?” said D’Artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the confidence of Athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.
A slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to D’Artagnan that the would-be assassin had saved his life.
“Yes; it asks if I am ready.”
Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he did not blanch.
“Haydée,” said he, “you well know.”
“Yes, yes,” said Albert, “and may there remain only the eternal friendship which I promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted to our children’s children, and shall always remind me that I owe my life and the honor of my name to you,—for had this been known, oh, Beauchamp, I should have destroyed myself; or,—no, my poor mother!
He had doubtless seen all.
Lean a little to the left.
“Why do you say so?”
“Yes, without the saddle.”
“I will do so.
Chapter XL.
“Madame,” replied Planchet, respectfully, “I am called Dulaurier, at your service.”
“What!” cried Porthos, “are we all going away, then?
Oh!
“Yes, but yesterday at five o’clock in the afternoon, thanks to you, she escaped.”
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, after a conference of five minutes’ duration, “let us begin our journey.”
“Now, I beg of you, don’t go off your head.
“What?
Milady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss.
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty.
“Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto.
That he was living on a small estate—but where?
Then the inconvenience became distress.
de Chevreuse had been in Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a _cabal;_ when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of arresting in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen’s emissary to the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king—Louis XIII.
enough!
He rose to return the salutation.
The letters were long—the four pages were covered with closely written words.
“Then,” continued he, “there is a horse for my lackey, and my valise.
“The woman you poisoned at Béthune was still younger than you, madame, and yet she is dead,” said D’Artagnan.
“Most undoubtedly,” said Planchet.
“Dantès is my friend, and I won’t have him ill-used.”
The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph, and he read:
Porthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles.
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity.
“Is he a sure man?”
If the league which threatened France triumphed, all his influence would be lost.
At the first word you dared to utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply, I called for help.”
The king was riding in front, surrounded by troopers, and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks.
“Ah, there you are, marechal,” cried Anne of Austria joyfully.
“Tell your coachman to stop at the door.”
You see that I cannot, like you, for instance, settle on any fixed plan.”
“The deuce!” cried D’Artagnan; “do you live in this way always?”
‘Have you any other guests in your house?’ inquired he.
“In that case,” said he, “I should lose her, and by my own fault.” He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it appeared reality.
“With the greatest care.
“No; thanks to something better.
The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose.

Ah, Madame,” said D’Artagnan, entering by the door which the young woman opened for him, “allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband.”
La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor; meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread.
“Oh, fear nothing,” said the skipper, showing his face.
“Where?”
The queen spoke with some impatience.
Ah, monseigneur!” continued Bonacieux, throwing himself at his Eminence’s feet, “ah, how truly you are the cardinal, the great cardinal, the man of genius whom all the world reveres!”
Dantès folded his hands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.
These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debray.
“I am at your service, sir,” said the abbé, with a marked Italian accent.
“How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested?”
And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying, “Are you wounded, my friend?
It will be a splendid session!”
“A gentleman, and a diplomatist.”
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Café de Paris.”
The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre, and returned with him in an instant.
50145m
Hastily snatching up the lighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs.
Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?”
Enough, sir, enough.
charming!” said Mazarin.
“On the other bank,” replied the executioner.
“Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M. Dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to become a captain.”
Bonacieux, “we must have them back again.”
It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison.
“We shall know, be assured.
We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man is true.”
He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes.
“The people will rise.”
I beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier.”
“Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.”
“Hold my stirrup, Bazin,” cried Aramis; and Aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.
“I must, then, remain here?”
“What will you do with him, madame?”
“‘Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.’
“I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter—yes, you, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh together!”
“Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting-knife.
How have you spent this 250,000 francs?—it is no business of mine.”
“Yes, on the contrary, they met, and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man.”
What is your name, in your turn, if you please?”
ah!
Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him.
“Place the _hands_,” repeated the curate, with a gesture.
“With which you are at war—is it not so?
“Perhaps you are right,” said Aramis, thoughtfully; “therefore I shall not pledge myself.”
“Another horse!” said Porthos.
Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth, turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.
“Really, that is a good idea!—two hours have I been boring you to death with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if I am going.
“Well, be it so!” said she.
“He has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.
“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if only to prevent your growing weary of me.
“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”
How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son, you have never spoken to me of either?”
I spoke to Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me, endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve.
“What is it?” asked Mazarin.
20214m
Planchet, in fact, had bedded and fed his horses, and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon.
“See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair, who was with me just now, is still in the palace.”
“What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe?”
“Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will not be able to see anything.”
Now, as a half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man, the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined.
“It is indeed a favor, young man,” replied M. de Tréville, “but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear to believe.
Unfortunately, whether through envy or stupidity, all Morrel’s correspondents did not take this view; and some even came to a contrary decision.
I will tell them to send her to you.”
“Why, one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta, of noble family.
“Come, come, my friend,” interrupted the marquise, “do not neglect your duty to linger with us.
1.F.5.
“No, I shall go as I am.
D’Artagnan in his Fortieth Year.
Athos, though now cool and collected, put his hand to his belt, where his loaded pistols yet remained.
“What is it?” said the light-horseman.
—Constancy and Discretion.”
“Debray!” muttered Albert.
“Get me out of this, in Heaven’s name!” he said, “or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men.”
I require the proof of a pre-engagement.
Porthos tried, and passed the upper portion of his body through.
“To the end.”
“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.
“Then, as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and hid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.
Athos then called Olivain.
Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes.
“I have already had the honor of telling you I was,” said Morrel.
1.F.2.
punctuality!
“But how?” asked Mazarin.
“While his Eminence was seeking for me in Paris, I would take, without sound of drum or trumpet, the road to Picardy, and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions.
“Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy—”
No, Albert, take my advice.
The queen had just regained her chamber, and D’Artagnan was about to retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched.
Better study a little common prudence.
Mme.
Nay, it must have been a promise.”
In one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands.”
“My brave young man, I will blow out your brains.
You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit from it.’
“Where is he?”
D’Artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge.
You do not believe me, M. Danglars!”
I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek; one is, I believe, from Phædrus, and the other from Bias.
“Oh, mon Dieu, it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out,” said the queen, “since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king.”
Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard, applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to Felton’s mouth.
“Well, I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please, prince though he is.”
“Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here?” asked Planchet.
yes.
“How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”
“Was I so badly lodged at Rome?” said Monte Cristo smiling.
How does this misfortune affect you?
To this flow of words, not perhaps in the best taste, but characteristic of D’Artagnan, whose principal object was to divert his opponent’s attention, Mordaunt did not reply, but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with D’Artagnan.
“And knowing all that, your honor remained here, far from the city, tranquil and inactive.”
God would not permit such a crime!”
Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed, but, to the surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it, and said nothing.
She looked around for help, and would have gone down to her grandfather’s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort, who took her arm and led her into the drawing-room.
“We are discovered!”
Whilst making this reflection, chance seemed, as it were, to give him the lie direct.
Grimaud, thinking that they had come, as he had, to try the port wine, effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one.
This man goes to give his last orders; take the least thing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.”
Felton barred his passage.
As the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob.
Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice,” said he, “and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid soprano, and then she plays the piano like Thalberg.
“Your excellency lodges at Pastrini’s hotel?”
“Halloo!” cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise, “halloo, Musketeers?
Therefore, leaving directions at every place for Grimaud, they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys.
“The knowledge that I have of the queen’s heart; she will not rest contented beaten.”
“What has happened?” said the count, simulating total ignorance.
Excuse me for speaking so very candidly, but as this is intended only for ourselves, I do not see why I should weigh my words.
“No less,” said Athos, as pale as a corpse.
I implored heaven that he might come.
27,” said the inspector.
“He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal’s hat in my own fashion.”
“Then we must fight.”
Penelon, Penelon!”
“Very.”
“No, certainly not.”
“Free!
At this rather impertinent order, Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt.
The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Château d’If; Dantès, nevertheless, determined to make for them.
D’Artagnan smiled—he was just the man to understand the astute Italian.
“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as the English do, “at the end of his teeth.”
Dantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned towards the sea.
Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly.’
“Oh, my dear count,” exclaimed Danglars, “I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you.”
At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten.
“The parliament!
“By Jove, I am falling, or rather, Bayard is falling,” answered Porthos.
Pearls fell drop by drop, as subterranean waters filter in their caves.
But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years; what he did during these ten years, God only knows.
Do you think so, sir?”
He then began to visit his friends of both sexes, in that strange costume.
Oh, my God, my God!”
This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels.
From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men,
“I have three, who would be honored by joining in the sport with me.”
“The punishment of death,” replied D’Artagnan.
D’Artagnan bent forward, ready either to attack or to stand on his defense.
“What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me?
“But, _mon Dieu!_ tell me, how can I do otherwise?”
“No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations, ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally; it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against the assassin.
Dantès was then guilty, and now he is innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which, however improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him defenceless.
“To the sloop,” said Felton, “and row quickly.”

Maximilian Morrel,” said the servant, announcing two fresh guests.
And he is very rich.”
“What is that?”
These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and happy.
D’Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased.
The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time.
Beside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.
He has killed the executioner of Bethune in an access of passion, but now his fury is assuaged.”
Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo.
Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the fire.
“Is he pleased with you?”
Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to his anger, “Monsieur,” said he, “you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion.”
How is your husband, our dear Monsieur Coquenard?
A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.
“How extraordinary!
“Not quite twenty-six!” murmured the voice; “at that age he cannot be a traitor.”
“Monsieur de Busigny,” said Athos, “will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?”
“Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain.”
“You have lived on the money he has given you.”
“You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that is not right—take care, or I may become troublesome.”
The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:
“No,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed me!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets.
At the first words of the Count de Guiche, the prince, having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon, had understood everything.
“Do you think,” said Madame de Villefort, “that Valentine is in league with him?
Take this ring; raise money with it, and let your husband set out.”
“Ah!
When the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des Fossoyeurs—that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII.
Are not your name, your social position, and your merit sufficient?”
“You are right; we must go out.”
We have made our calculations with Spartan economy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.”
There is no hurry, you know.
“What?” said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom; “what?
“When are you to pay?”
“Ah, stay!
But this annoys you; let us change the subject.
“Every man that’s born must fulfil his destiny.”
“Doubtless,” said Aramis, “for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure, heads are in question, not for our lackeys—”
You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d’hôte of the Hôtel des Princes, or the Café de Paris.
“‘Well,’ said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, ‘all I can say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.’
ah!” said Groslow.
It was about six o’clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue ocean.
“And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?”
“Oh, mother,” he exclaimed, “such a misfortune has happened!”
Half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had just pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali’s finger.
We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door, and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared.
The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts, and I found myself in the house.
“Do you know him?” asked the officer.
It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.
I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier, that the contract is to be signed this evening.”
Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.”
“It is M. Maximilian Morrel,” said she; “the son of that good merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.”
You shall be my body-guard.
“You are right; it is more difficult than I thought.
What refreshment can I offer?
Dantès was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones.
Go to bed, or at least lie down in your clothes.
“I think so, also,” replied Albert; “and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano’s ball.”
One day, when he was seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to be taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his flock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was called Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and that then he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be short, and that he must profit as much as possible by it.
“How?” replied D’Artagnan, “you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed?
“At the Louvre.”
To crown his happiness, Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputy-governor of the chateau.
“Of former days, my lord!
Why, having recognized you, and I the only one to do so—why was I able to save my son alone?
As to the Duc de Bouillon, he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter; but his place was well filled by the Duc d’Elbeuf and his four sons, ranged around him like a staff.
What do you think of Monsieur de Tréville telling me, when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated with the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?”
“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories.
“Your holiness!” said Gondy; “my friend, you take me for some one else.”
Oh, I am very presuming, I am aware.
When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you—my heart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter.
“His Eminence was uneasy, and sent me to find you.”
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, “I doubted, but now I believe.”
“I have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de Villefort, that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her.
There now, M. Morrel, that’s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is not it true, you fellows there?” A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings.
Yes, it is one of Milady’s bastards!”
And why were you alone?”
“Should you know those doors again?”
Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the carriage.
“Oh, my friends,” said D’Artagnan, “you come once more to save my life, not only mine but that of these gentlemen.
“And on what will you sleep?” said D’Artagnan.
Are you fond of traveling?”
The roll call continued.
pardieu!” said D’Artagnan, “you know you will not be my prisoner very long.”
“Yes.”
Although I don’t despise sweet things in proper time and place, I found the supper rather light.”
Nevertheless, at eight o’clock in the morning the regiment of the queen’s guards, commanded by Guitant, under whom was his nephew Comminges, marched publicly, preceded by drums and trumpets, filing off from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame, a manoeuvre which the Parisians witnessed tranquilly, delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms.
Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door, and reached her room in an agony of fear.
He followed M. d’Épinay, saw him enter, afterwards go out, and then re-enter with Albert and Château-Renaud.
“Ah, good morning, my dear count,” said he.
There, on a table, surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco known,—from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,—was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond; beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an open cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers.
“But it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place—cry, ‘Down with Mazarin!’”
“There can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel; but for God’s sake, do not forget, as you yourself said, Athos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London he will put it out of her power to injure us.
Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o’clock.
It is twelve o’clock, Maximilian; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening, or tomorrow morning.
The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to approach nearer, were looking at Noirtier’s old servant, who had heard the noise from his master’s room, and run there also, remaining behind the others.
They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay.
The musketeers trotted up, and at the same time the ten men whom D’Artagnan had given to Comminges appeared.
“It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o’clock,” thought D’Artagnan; “that’s a settled custom.”
“Pray go, Valentine,” said; M. de Villefort, “and see what this new fancy of your grandfather’s is.” Valentine rose quickly, and was hastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort altered his intention.
“I’faith, yes,” said Athos, “for I am hungry.”
During the scene of tumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then, leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most graceful attitude possible, he said:
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place.
Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented, and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre.
“Colonel Tomlison,” said Charles, “kings cannot yield; the man alone submits to force.”
“Yes, indeed, my dear duke.
“Yes; it will.
Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.”
D’Artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart.
This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes.
You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper.
I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your pardon.”
The count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his arms, and Haydée, uttering a cry, sprang into them.
“Gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too late.”
“What!
Who could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called accursed?
The Nubian smiled.
I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless opposed, weak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out, ‘These miserable Puritans!
Cavalcanti,” continued Danglars, “is about to marry you, and will place in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million livres.”
“Then you accept his offer?” said the host.
God’s death, don’t fire!” screamed D’Artagnan, throwing open the window.
“And they would be right, _pardieu!_”
Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend.
“Oh, know him?
There, again, Monte Cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts.
“I like the means well enough,” said D’Artagnan, “but where and how to meet with her?”
Grimaud appeared.
In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance.
“I am all attention,” said Eugénie, looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze.
“Your Eminence may believe,” added D’Artagnan, “that we would have come to meet you, if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants.”
An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search.
and shall we take no notice of this incident?’ M. de Morcerf turned pale, and clenched his hands on the papers he held.
He knew the Abbé de Gondy only by report.
In every country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner terrible, often makes him feared.
As he said this, he pressed Grimaud’s hand, who seemed honored by the distinction.
Adieu, Edmond, adieu, and thank you.”
“Good-day, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Planchet proudly.
“We will save your soul,” said the young man; “but are you really the executioner of Bethune, as these people say?”
“Decidedly, Aramis,” said Athos, “I think I was wrong not to let you fire.”
“What?” said Albert, seeing that Beauchamp hesitated.
The principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.
“I don’t think the sides are equal.”
“The first is, that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the interview.”
“Are all your family well?” asked the count, with an affectionate benevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.
“Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.”
“Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson & French of Rome.”
Bassompierre and Schomberg, against the Duc d’Angoulême.
Athos did not even turn his head.
“Yes,” said Grimaud.
The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau, a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing; and even then the precaution seemed superfluous, the wall was so high.
Would not M. Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison?”
Is it not so, madame?”
here is De Winter coming,” said Athos.
“She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.”
Aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap, not much unlike a _calotte_, was seated before an oblong table, covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio.
I think you wished to do so of your own accord?”
“I have the note,” said he to Athos and to his friends.
“Some parting words to his friends.”
“Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed—a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.”
Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years.
“The letter signed ‘Sinbad the Sailor,’ is it not?”
“Have I by any means displeased you?
D’Avrigny’s look implied, “I told you it would be so.” Then he slowly uttered these words, “Who is now dying in your house?
“We will walk back and forth.”
Charles, without replying a single word, turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it.
Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into the court, and two at the back into the garden.
“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès.
“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto, declared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”
We will send my brother’s servant back to Béthune, whom, as I told you, we can trust.
It may be judged whether D’Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.
They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on, that they might not fail at the appointed place.
“Never mind,” replied Villefort; “I say that this marriage _shall_ be consummated.”
“Oh, father,” continued the executioner, without opening his eyes, as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object, “it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river, that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me; it then seems as if my hand grew heavy, as if the cutlass was still in its grasp, as if the water had the color of blood, and all the voices of nature—the whispering of the trees, the murmur of the wind, the lapping of the wave—united in a voice tearful, despairing, terrible, crying to me, ‘Place for the justice of God!’”
the three young people separated—that is to say, Morrel went to the Boulevards, Château-Renaud to the Pont de la Révolution, and Debray to the Quai.
“I?
The intelligent creature was received with loud applause.
Athos and D’Artagnan said nothing, but their silence seemed to imply consent.
“No, but I heard all.
“You must excuse us, count,” returned Franz, “but we have still much to do.”
“They have closed up the grating with a board.”
“Ah!” thought D’Artagnan, “the man I am warned against by Athos.”
What!
The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and without hesitation said, “Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.”
But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary.
But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth—she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men.
“Is, in fact, unlimited,” said Monte Cristo.
“Yes, yes,” continued Morrel; “recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
“What have been the results of your quarrel?” said the cardinal, knitting his brow.
“Not to arouse suspicions, gentlemen,” said he, “go your way and I will go mine, and this evening at nine o’clock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint Denis.
Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish, the ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their friend.
The people had made no demonstration for the princes, but they had risen for Broussel; they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves.
I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention, I believe, of making me a soldier; and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince.”
And turning with that fury which made him so formidable, he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents, a man who, with a huge sword in his hand, was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers.
Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother.
“It will take place,” said Monte Cristo, in a most solemn tone; “but instead of your son’s blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.”
“Of what country are you?” asked the prince.
It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.”
“At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you confirmed my opinion.”
“And what message shall I convey to the baroness!”
“Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering, like the light of a lamp about to expire.
as to conditions, you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are!”
“And have you never tried to understand them?”
However, because I was prudent you must not take me for a fool.
“Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find your father awaiting you.”
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son.
“Madame Danglars?”
Yes, in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to effect.
He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head.
“‘What do you fear, Vasiliki?’ said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud.
“By _us_, you mean!” cried D’Artagnan.
Gaetano departed with the reply.
You will accompany monsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you.
With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.
“Since that time many things have happened to you.
A regiment of cuirassiers, nearly equal as to numbers, issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it.
30029m
“What can he be looking for?” thought Edmond.
We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth reaches.
“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is understood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see I am overwhelmed with luxury.
“Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,” said Debray; “facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness unexceptionable.”
40010m
“Stop,” cried D’Artagnan; “I, too, am going.”
53; yes, I am vice-president.”
“Do you wish to see her?” Noirtier again made an affirmative sign.
“Wherefore, sir?
The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel.
_Pardieu!_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about to have to do with a very different number of people.
“Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.”
“Just this.
“Chancellor,” said the queen, turning to Seguier, our old acquaintance, “you will open the conferences.
never!—I could not!”
As to D’Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black.
The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret, before which D’Artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence.
What is it that we really desire?—that which we cannot obtain.
“But,” replied Madame Danglars, “the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.”
Now, M. Bertuccio is alone in the world; he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it; he is sure never to leave my service.”
Therefore, after the connection had continued three years, carefully fostered by D’Artagnan, who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year, each doing credit to the other, the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to D’Artagnan that he should marry her.
“It is the monk,” whispered Porthos to Aramis.
“Monsieur Mordaunt,” he said, “since, after running after one another so long, chance has at last brought us together, let us have a little conversation, if you please.”
“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.”
“But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper.
“And madness?”
D’Artagnan and Athos took the nags of Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying the saddles on their heads.
“Yes, yes,” said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge.
“Then,” said Albert, “you became the property of this man?”
“And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he was drowned?”
“Which road?” asked the postilion in Italian.
They conducted me to the Chatelet, where I slept soundly, being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free.
In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house.
“A tigress, a panther!
The Avenger.
But here are your bonds; pay me differently;” and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp.
“I believe you, madame, to be a great and powerful queen, and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to Saint Germain.”
“They are these; never to leave the prisoner alone; to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument, and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers.”
“You are a brave young man,” said Buckingham, holding out his hand to D’Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully.
“The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was watched.
“Come,” thought Danglars, “it is the same old story.” And while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his temples get moist with perspiration.
What can have become of her, then?”
The abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and smiled.
“Madame,” said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, “I am not the only one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed.”
When I speak of ignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or death.
“It is possible,” said Milady.
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy.
In short, why should I have any more to do with the affair?
“Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.”
“Yes, true as Gospel,” said D’Artagnan; “but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities.”
When they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied; but being anxious not to be too conspicuous, all, with the exception of Porthos, who had a fancy to display his red doublet, were quite satisfied with their places, the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row, so that they were exactly opposite the arm-chair prepared for the royal prisoner.
“Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least.
Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table—at least, I hope so—two benefactors of humanity.”
“Oh, things take their course without our assistance.
The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel, that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.
“There,” continued Athos, “either peace or war will be decided; honor, at all events, will be maintained!”
Athos bowed and obeyed.
“Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,” replied Monte Cristo, as if the subject had not been mentioned before.
He approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his own, and letting it fall, “All is useless,” said he, “he is dead.”
“Are you interested in the sugar question?” asked the editor of the ministerial paper.
Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet.
Gentlemen,” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, “I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides, you sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at your disposal.”
“Spur your horses!
The musketeers, few in number, not being able, in the midst of this crowd, to make their horses wheel around, began to give way.
D’Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere.
“Yes—two soldiers.”
“I do not think it, I am certain of it.”
Chapter XX.
“No, my friend,” said Athos, “you must leave us.”
“Devil take me!” answered D’Artagnan, “I wish you joy of it.
You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond’s last wishes.”
“But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,” said Château-Renaud.
Something was at work on the other side of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had substituted a lever for a chisel.
“Monsieur du Vallon, yonder, is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly, so he does not care about money.
As Bertuccio, with a respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.
His visit to M. de Tréville being paid, the pensive D’Artagnan took the longest way homeward.
“Why, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three times, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a stone, slipped, and strained my knee.”
There was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the young man, which silenced the tumult.
“That’s true,” said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man.
As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.”
“Ah, my yellow horse,” cried he.
Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle.
In an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon his adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to intimidate.
“Come,” replied the same lofty tone, “answer!
“You may guess, finding the luck turned, that I again staked the diamond.”
You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Château d’If.
At last the half-hour struck.
The Law
I was promised he should die with me.
Has the sun done anything for me?
Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and then his mind was made up—when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug.
The physician has a sacred mission on earth; and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life, and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb.
“It is evident, sir, that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs; otherwise you would know that since we left Paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times; that he has there met De Beaufort, De Bouillon, the coadjutor and D’Elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him.”
“Alone in the world!” repeated a voice behind the count, “and why?”
“Sir,” she replied, “did I not say, and did you not hear me say to those people, that you should do as you pleased?”
“And is she gone?”
At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black, who seemed waiting for some one, and who, from the moment he saw them enter the town, never took his eyes off them.
Again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him.
‘Humph!’ thought I, ‘that looks like my handiwork; I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other.’ And, in fact, it was that unfortunate Scotchman, Parry’s brother, you know, on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his strength.

“I did.”
“Yet conscience remains,” remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice, and with a stifled sigh.

And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess Lucina?
The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister.
The queen had at first positively refused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated, would commit some folly.
“And now, gentlemen,” he continued, turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, “I have no further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war.”
Bonacieux, “pardon me for interrupting you; but what do you advise me to do?
“What do you want with me?” said she, “and why do you place your hand on me?”
Franz untied it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:
But in France they are considered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which avenge.”
and must I lose the one to save the other?
“Precisely so,” replied Gaetano.
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved him, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court, since she had discovered all.
Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain?
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her, plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection—a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time she doubts, for the first time she fears.
“You laugh Aramis.”
I am not a fighting man at all, monsieur, and I am afraid of the Bastille.”
One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye, trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body.
“Save me, I am pursued!” said Andrea, clasping his hands.
He had tried his strength to the utmost.
You see it is not my fault.”
“But I come expressly for that purpose.”
The voice of the king was tremulous with anger.
Well, try the Hotel de Luynes, Raoul, and ask if the duchess can receive you.
Ah, let him say now if he does not recognize me!’ Each word fell like a dagger on Morcerf, and deprived him of a portion of his energy; as she uttered the last, he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom, and fell back on his seat, overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair.
“Oh, that’s nothing!
“Very well, Cardinal, very well; but, meantime, send for Monsieur the Keeper of the Seals.
“Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?
And D’Artagnan retired, but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper.
D’Artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity.
The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase.
Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph.
We have a king ten years old, who doesn’t yet know what he wants; we have a queen blinded by a belated passion; we have a minister who governs France as he would govern a great farm—that is to say, intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention; we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition, who will draw from Mazarin’s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes.
Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived.
ah!
“Because you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.”
“Good,” said Comminges.
“Try and make an effort to do so, my good man.” said d’Avrigny.
Good-natured, confiding, and forgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning, and wicked, or rather, immovable as fate.
“What day do you fix?” asked the president.
“Open the gate,” he cried.
Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons.
If they kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble.
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no refreshment.
If so, you can spare yourself the trouble.”
“The name of Edmond’s betrothed was Mercédès.”
Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed her of her grandfather’s wish.
“Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,” interposed Renée, “it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues——”
Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion.
“Very good,” said Gondy, shaking Rochefort by the hand, who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him.
Athos as a Diplomatist.
“But,” said D’Artagnan, “shall we not pursue that woman?”
She asked D’Artagnan if he had a mistress.
“Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I was expecting you.”
“I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet an enemy here.”
“Oh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she, “what are you doing?”
* “The Three Musketeers.”
“Completely so.”
“The first, that we have not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour.”
If you know a prayer, say it—for you are condemned, and you shall die.”
To the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it.
“That is what we must find out,” returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star.
Suppose that the Supreme Being, after having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was good—suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night—then—even then, Mercédès, you could not imagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment.”
“And what shall I say to the people?”
“Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.”
“No more money?
“Because,” replied D’Artagnan, “the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest.”
A gleam of light shone in Aramis’s eyes, as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face, but not so brief but that it was seen by D’Artagnan.
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley of fireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear.
Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man’s death he returned.
And on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.
Bonacieux.
“Forget you!
Monsieur, if she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear.”
“Yes, Count,” said Milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand in her own, “I am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met.
“Near the merchant’s signature there was, indeed, the seal of the sublime emperor.
“What is the matter?
In spite of his prudence, D’Artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.
The count opened the letter, and read:
You will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used.”
“No,” returned Monte Cristo “I only guessed.
“And you ought to thank her, Raoul.
Live the Guards!” M. de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was lost.
“One moment—I beg—for here are the Chevalier d’Herblay and the Comte de la Fere, just arrived from London, and they can give you, as eye-witnesses, such details as you can convey to the queen, my royal sister.
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I consent to Bazin with all my heart, but grant me Planchet.
I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded.”
“Oh no, it is as simple as possible,” replied Monte Cristo.
On perceiving Mazarin he bowed.
“Now climb up, Athos, quickly,” said D’Artagnan.
But here it is: you have sentiments, the devil knows what, such as every one can’t entertain.
Aramis stopped on seeing Athos smile.
“And yet I should have preferred——”
Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.
Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them—then, at last, the volcano was extinguished—then all was dark and still—the floating bark and heaving ocean.
This man was Cromwell.
“And was the sum a large one?”
Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you.
He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to the Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked.
At length, the long-desired sound was heard, and instead of one figure, as he had expected, he perceived that two were approaching him.
“Ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me,” replied Aramis, “you shall know nothing.”
There was no answer, and she continued:
Believe me, it is only the evil-minded who deny friendship; they cannot understand it.
“Tomorrow,” said he, “you will be avenged, or I shall be dead.”
“No, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery.”
“No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case.
Buckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.
But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré, announced by the chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.
In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentine’s mind.
Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions.
Some one drew near.
She still had her rich fair hair; her large, animated, intelligent eyes, so often opened by intrigue, so often closed by the blindness of love.
“He took you for Buckingham!” cried D’Artagnan.
“Ah,” murmured Athos, kissing her hand, “had I only sooner known that Marie Michon was so charming a creature!” And he withdrew, sighing.
An angel alone could have saved one of us from death—that angel came from heaven, if not to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at least to make us esteem each other.”
“Lord bless us!
“Monsieur,” said Mousqueton, who, abandoning his horse on the high road, had come on foot to rejoin his master, “Phoebus could no longer hold out and——”
“Place confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will find a messenger.”
“Monsieur,” said the young man, saluting again and more profoundly, “monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman.”
“I say that he doesn’t suit me at all,” said Porthos, “and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramis’s advice.”
Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair, without the power of moving.
“One!” said the grave-diggers, “two!
“Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.”
“Politeness, you simpleton!” retorted La Carconte.
“Athos!” cried D’Artagnan, wringing his hands.
At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil.
“True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second restoration, you would then pass for a great man.”

The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened a door.
If she had not yet taken any repose, he at least was already up.
“Oh, my Lord!” said Laporte.
You are come too late—you are come to see me die.
Bonacieux, and dwelt for an instant on the lips of D’Artagnan.
Answer!” continued Milady.
“While I watched the window, he guarded the door.”
M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion.”
It was Mordaunt with the order in his hand.
Barrois looked at the old man.
“Silence, D’Herblay!” cried Athos; “such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these.
Chevalier,” he continued, addressing Aramis, who, leaning proudly on his sword, seemed to agree with his companion, “Chevalier, Porthos and I run no risk; besides, should any ill-luck happen to two of us, will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended?
“Yes.
It was done on purpose for me—I am sure of it.”
Here, take this,’ continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so?”
“Accepted the money!” said D’Artagnan.
“Zaccone?—is not his name Monte Cristo?”
“Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?”
I am at present in the midst of war, and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles.
you, is it?
I have always found them; and more,—I repeat it with joy, with triumph,—I have always found some proof of human perversity or error.
“So much the worse,” said Porthos.
She ran therefore to Debray, who, after having, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the world.
My lackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many from the cellar.
“Why didn’t you do it?” asked the lieutenant.
“Good!” thought D’Artagnan: “in this direction I am satisfied.” He pressed Aramis’s hand and went in search of Porthos.
“He’s in the Bastile.”
In short, doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost reliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this axiom, _errare humanum est_.”
Tell me at least the means.”
“How!
But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand, the acceptance receipted—the splendid diamond.
Though his coming was announced in a very low tone, Madame de Saint-Méran arose from her pillow.
This time I have merely come from Cadiz.”
As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerf’s antechamber, a footman, the same who at Rome had brought the count’s card to the two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into the vestibule, and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him.
Undeceive yourself again; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without affecting her.
“One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me.
“So, owing to your popularity——”
It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender, it reaches then, quite naturally, the highest exaltation of which it is capable.
A moment’s silence ensued and then, in a full, sonorous voice, the king exclaimed: “Remember!”
“Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,” said Valentine, “again you plunge the dagger into the wound!
Dantès read it.
“My dear D’Artagnan,” replied Aramis, “you understand, when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbé I say as few masses as I can.
Then the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner to enter the house.
The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention.
“That is he—wounded in the shoulder.”
A present from an enemy is not a good thing.
Grimaud turned round with a jerk, recognized me, and pointed to the man in the mask.
I suppose you mean—” continued D’Artagnan.
When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom.
Haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin spotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water.
“I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say.
I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then——”
D’Artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place.
“You must still deliver it,” said Athos.
Athos led his guest into a dining-room of moderate size, the windows of which opened on one side on a garden, on the other on a hot-house full of magnificent flowers.
Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns, rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was checkmated—M.
“Come, come, gentlemen,” said Mordaunt, impatiently, “let us depart.”
This house, in past years, did ours a great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having rendered us this service.”
“I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with my head,” said he.
And I have not seen him!
Faria started: “Have you, indeed?” cried he, raising his head with quick anxiety; “pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?”
All is over.”
The brigadier had a moment’s hope.
Once in France he turned his course toward Paris, and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne.
Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.
She found Milady with a smiling countenance.
“Yes, indeed but one!” said the major with a sigh.
“Yes,” added Athos, “I now ask you, D’Artagnan, what side you are on?
“To get married?”
“What you say is full of sense,” replied D’Artagnan; “but unfortunately I have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve precisely.
“My lord, I never believe cardinals who are not priests.”
D’Artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard’s march upon the door.
Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin.”
“‘“Then you must die,” replied the president calmly.
When at three paces distant from each other, Albert and the count stopped.
Monsieur de Lillebonne, lead my horse by the bridle, if you please.” As he spoke he dismounted, gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said, in a voice perfectly composed, “To the Palais Royal, at full trot.”

“Ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank shall be notified.”
“Sire,” replied M. de Tréville, calmly, “on the contrary, I come to demand it of you.”
As he spoke, the abbé took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse, said, “Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.”
Look!” and D’Artagnan, obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed, showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back, which, sometimes submerged, sometimes rising, seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred.
“I should be ungrateful,” said Athos, “and I regard ingratitude, not as a fault or a crime, but as a vice, which is much worse.”
“Suppose we warn the masters.”
The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice, before every one, of their previous interview.
The heart of the young man overflowed with joy.
It was then, upon the manifestation of this astonishment, that D’Artagnan related to him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to the devotion of his three friends, whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road, he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust, which had pierced the queen’s letter and for which he had repaid M. de Wardes with such terrible coin.
Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out of prison.”

“My lord,” said La Ramee, “now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves, pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness.”
“For stealing.”
“Now,” said Tréville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone, “now let us talk about yourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and the humiliation of his Eminence.
“And now,” said La Ramee, “I must ask your highness’s pardon, but it seems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure.”
“Yes, I have received—”
“_Pardieu!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted, “_pardieu_, it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend’s house.
“But it is probable,” said the light-horseman, “that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion.”
Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way.
This cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his Eminence.
Bertuccio’s forehead was covered with perspiration; however, he obeyed, and, leaning out of the window, he cried to the coachman,—“Rue de la Fontaine, No.
A groom was rubbing them down; near them were saddles and bridles.
And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain.
“What?
I merely ask you, did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen, whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal?”
There were two means of gaining his object—to search him on the spot, or to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in the trench.
“Your treasure?” stammered Dantès.
Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following.
The mendicant shook his head.
But when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate heart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber.”

The Will Chapter 60.
“But this is infamous!” cried he.
The fifth sharer in Edmond’s bequest, was his own father.”
“Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,” answered Albert; “and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear Franz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and connected with the very cream of Parisian society.”
“Why, as to that—I think, my dear son, you must be by this time so accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country.”
It was then nearly eight o’clock in the evening.
“None, my lord.”
Go to bed and sleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.”
I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame.
“Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw?”
He reflected, but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food, no drug with the wine.
“Yes; he appears to be a resolute fellow.”
“Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,” said the man; “I came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.”
“Well!” answered the boy, “the thing is done.”
“‘“You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your accomplice.
If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after someone,” said D’Artagnan.
Seven men in two days, and those of his very best!
“Without a doubt he must.”
“That is to say, whom you do not like,” returned the queen.
Madame de Villefort merely cried, “Be still, Edward!” She then added, “This young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty.
Did Edmond make you his heir?”
‘Forty thousand,’ cried La Carconte; ‘we will not part with it for that sum.
Fortunately, Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely; and, as they reached him, he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July came.
“_One!_” said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse, disfigured by so awful a death.
You can form no idea of the expression of that old man’s eye when he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and, I had almost said, by whom he is beloved in return.
Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you did not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.
It is not just that he should despise me so, without any reason.
“Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird.”
The king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing.
“_Ma foi_, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter; you received one, did you not?”
“May I venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence?”
It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz’s host, had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional privileges.
“Ought we to go on?” asked Franz of the count; “or should we pause?”
“Oh, she would like it, but——”
I shall meet with a victim.
“One in Rue de Vaugirard, the other Rue de la Harpe.”
In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might, besides, be accidental, D’Artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance.
“Zounds, Lieutenant!” said he; “you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions, particularly if my Lord has authorized you to look into her bed.”
No one at Villefort’s doubted that a duel would ensue from it.
There is a certain fatality in it.”
“And her brother?” added D’Artagnan, timidly.
“Well?”
“I have to weep over the grave of my father,” replied Morrel in a broken voice.
He saw me this morning for the first time, and has already forgotten he has seen me.
Bonacieux, sorrowfully.
The first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature.
Louvieres was proud and satisfied; he had taken revenge on Mazarin and had aided in his father’s deliverance from prison.
France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not find in its eighty-five departments—I say eighty-five, because I do not include Corsica—you will not find, then, in these eighty-five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp.
Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him warmly.
“Yes, I know that,” said Buckingham; “he has a prisoner.”
“Well,” said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no muscle of his countenance disturbed, “well, my dear Vampa, it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.”
“And why not?” said Aramis, in his tone of raillery.
At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed.
“Yes, dear Monsieur Porthos.
Review your life, Albert; although it is only just beginning, did a lovely summer’s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career?
“No, truly—you comfort me.”
They found him up, less pale than when D’Artagnan left him after his first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was spread enough for four persons.
“No.
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.
“Let us alight here,” said Athos.
“Formerly a brewer,” replied the Gascon.
“He is worn out,” said Debray; “besides, he could not well appear in public, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears, presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.”
“Does his island produce him such a revenue?”
“I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits.”
“Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested?”
Danglars, seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and said:
“Which route must I take?” demanded D’Artagnan, in his turn.
“Ah, your excellency,” murmured the pilot, “you should not have done so; our master will scold us for it.”
“Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency.”
But you need not fear.
“’Tis well,” said the abbé, convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth.
“Hem!
Adieu!”
“The _Pharaon_ has gone down, then?” said Morrel in a hoarse voice.
He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately a pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was reflected on his hands and countenance.
“And, moreover, my dear duke,” continued the minister of police, “we are almost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane.”
Noirtier wishes to speak.”
“The chief’s mistress?”
You do not make Raoul work, so he takes his own way of employing himself.”
If you will give at each of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will follow you thither.
He opened his mouth to reply, but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.
“Did he know my father’s Christian name was Fernand, and his family name Mondego?”
For my part, I always thought his poetry detestable, and I think I know something about poetry.”
From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain.
“Help!” cried Caderousse; “I require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps I am not mortally wounded—I may not die; perhaps they can yet save my life.”
They went downstairs, Raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand, but Athos was silent.
She is all-powerful yonder; she will help me.
“I am—I am No.
Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.
that’s the thing!” replied the Gascon.
“Did I not tell you I wished for one?” replied the count, frowning.
Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travelling-carriage would arrive at six o’clock.
“You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo.
“You are welcome, monsieur,” said Milady, in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which D’Artagnan had just remarked; “you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude.”
“Is your steward also a Nubian?” asked Debray.
“Stuff and nonsense; we have seen plenty of dead men in our time.”
how strong one feels here!” said Porthos, almost burying his large feet in the sands.
The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.
Chapter VI.
“To find such a wife as my father found.”
Ali bowed in token of strict obedience.
“Ah,” said Andrea, “who knows?”
This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table.
Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow.
Caderousse rose.
“My fair friend,” said Athos, “allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war.
“Yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.”
Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage.
Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced.
“You will relate all the rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti.
One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit D’Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards.
D’Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and the two Guards following him.
“Gentlemen,” said Mazarin, “I join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects.
“Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness itself.”
“Here I am, sir!” said Athos, leaning and stretching out his arm to Mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him; “here I am, take my hand and jump into our boat.”
“Yes, and now I shall be more calm.”
Each of them, when the other was not looking, hazarded a sly glance.
He resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no success foreign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance.
No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilian’s situation, and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise.”
Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket, but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole.
Te Deum for the Victory of Lens.
La Ramee sent away the guards, desiring them to drink to the duke’s health, and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors, put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified:
It came from my brother, the King of Spain.
“One thing still puzzles me,” observed Dantès, “and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?”
Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall, he throws me another; that other ball contains a letter.
“Yes, for Mazarin has granted what I desire.”
Let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other.
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making nocturnal excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d’Angoulême important orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.
Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one else observed.
Morrel, I possess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a fortune you can attain every wish.
“By men of heart I mean men of courage.
“Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me!” said D’Artagnan, raising his sword.
And you say that by his will——”
He whose intellect was thus supreme, Raoul, was the actual sovereign; the other, nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul; and yet, so powerful is majesty amongst us, this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away.
Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,—a conversation which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation.
From that moment the old man’s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.
Full of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and, thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh recovered.
Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen.
D’Artagnan took charge of it.
Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf’s, and then he passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the way.
By Kitty’s chamber he could gain that of her mistress.
“Show him in,” said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that D’Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.
“Sir,” said Madame Danglars, “you can feel for my emotion, can you not?
We might say that was his dream.
Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere?”
About two o’clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a white waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown trousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features—a person, in a word, who, although evidently past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the porter’s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if he were within.
When he came within hearing, he exclaimed:
I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear the way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis will follow us by that of Noyon; as to D’Artagnan, he will go by what route he thinks is best, in Planchet’s clothes, while Planchet will follow us like D’Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards.”
“Why,” said she, “you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the Tuileries inside!
“In that case let us go,” said the shipmaster.
The Trial.
I?
“We have reached it!” repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness.
“Sir, I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not realize six per cent of this sum.”
At the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme.
“Have a care,” cried Porthos to his opponent; “I’ve still two pistols charged.”
Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen.
“If we have no news of them this evening, to-morrow we must start.”
“Mordaunt!
The Castle of Bragelonne.
Locusta
The papers had related his various adventures, both as the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains.
“In the whole house,” said Friquet; “the house belongs to him; he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals; he must be at dinner now; it is noon.”
“Where can you find them, then?”
I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.
D’Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry, but erect and haughty under her black hood.
Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world.
“Why, sir, a man of about fifty.”
Well!
The matter was arranged as D’Artagnan had suggested, and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table, where Parry waited on him, Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table, and, in a corner, places reserved for himself and his companions.
“Your eminence, it concerns the war which the king, my husband, is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects.
“But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.
Milady perceived a bed; she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas, but still further, her complexion.
“I have told you to hope,” said the count.
“Well,” cried his auditors; “at the moment you left his house?”
“Old enough to be ambitious, but too young to be corrupt.
“Monsieur,” replied the count, with a chilling air, “I am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me,—a favor which, however estimable, is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.”
“You think this house pretty, do you not?”
“Porthos’s plan appears to me to be impracticable,” said D’Artagnan, “inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you.
At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself, and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.
She thanked them both with a smile.
“Well, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the old one; and let us drink.”
“Bah,” said Beauchamp, “he played the prince very well.”
The sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.
But, since you say nothing remains but for M. d’Épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed, and the following day you will be his, tomorrow you will be engaged to M. d’Épinay, for he came this morning to Paris.” Valentine uttered a cry.
“I have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o’clock in the morning I must be in London.”
Fly, fly!”
The landlord sent out for every description of garment, as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe.
Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father’s abode.
D’Artagnan started on seeing these tears.
there’s another brave and excellent young man.”
The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.”
“But where shall we go?” asked Porthos.
My father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and yourself—whom he considered the first three personages in France.”
“Can he be inconstant before being happy?”
D’Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.
“I won’t hold my tongue!” replied Caderousse; “I say I want to know why they should put Dantès in prison; I like Dantès; Dantès, your health!” and he swallowed another glass of wine.
“You seem, sir,” she remarked, “to be making me undergo a course of cross-examination.”
“Hold your tongue, hypocrite,” said Andrea; “you love me!”
“I—drunk!” said Caderousse; “well that’s a good one!
He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly unknown to him.
But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Château d’If to this island.
“Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie, and speaks of his family.
“Farewell, then, or rather, _au revoir_, for I hope we shall meet again.”
Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever you leave your master, I will promise you a place in my service.”
“And give up your share of the venture,” said Edmond, “to remain with me?”
Athos shuddered from head to foot.
I recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while I managed to stammer forth:
We need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips.
“And you are a fool for having said anything about it,” said a voice from the top of the stairs.
‘Oh, make yourself easy on that head,’ said Ali, smiling; ‘Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter.
“If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my Musketeers,” said Tréville, “the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so well known that I demand an inquiry.”
“Your probity,” replied the stranger, “is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to see you.
“On the sea.”
If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
“All is well, I thank you; now leave us alone, Mr. Felton.”
“There are no horses.”
“But you will be resigned, my friend.”
Athos required no more.
Have they not obeyed me?”
“What, you talk of debaucheries, Madame Messalina, Lady Macbeth!
“That’s no doubt very fine,” said Porthos; “but deuce take me if I understand at all.”
It resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn, and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.
“Ah!” cried Porthos; “would I were but a baron!”
“I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was carried off.”
“Well, be it so,” at length said Eugénie; “return by the same road you came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.”
At this moment Emmanuel entered, his countenance full of animation and joy.
I knew very well that they tired out their executioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their lovers!’
“I!
“Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,” interrupted the count; “you have done a little of everything in your life.”
Come, let us talk a little about my father.”
This is the second time that Monsieur d’Artagnan has been in England.
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility.
“Ah, indeed!
There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.
“I don’t know; we separated, as you know.
At half past seven the retreat was sounded.
“Or?” repeated Morrel.
Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more.
“Adieu, then, to both, my good friends,” said D’Artagnan; “may God preserve you!
He then set himself to work to count his fortune.
“How old is she?” inquired the Vicomte de Bragelonne.
“I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées.”
They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis.
“I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.”

“Yes, my lord, and from pure devotion to the cause, for Monsieur de Bracieux is rich.”
“And has he found consolation?”
“And so he is in Paris?”
The blood had mounted to the head of D’Artagnan, and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.
Chapter 61.
A light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to the Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice.
“There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named Caderousse, but he was very drunk.
“What is my daughter doing?” asked Madame Danglars.
“Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a sleepless night, which has caused the minister’s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.”
A square table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the room.
“Perhaps,” continued Villefort, “he had put it in the foundling hospital.”
Andrea, on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera, was explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease, his future projects, and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy-five thousand livres per annum.
Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts, D’Artagnan.
“Yes,” said Athos, “that’s Grimaud’s business.”
He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o’clock she had not returned.
“There, monsieur, there is that letter!” cried the queen, with a broken and trembling voice; “take it, and deliver me from your odious presence.”
One arm was hanging out of the bed; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain Pillon’s “Graces,”23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed.
D’Artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys; he remained on horseback, feeling no inclination to dismount, and sat looking at the bars, at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat, but by which he had for twenty years been awe-struck.
“I am going to fire!”
“I believe so, at least.”
“But whither shall we fly—whither escape?”
“You are most welcome, monsieur,” said the Count of Morcerf, saluting Monte Cristo with a smile, “and monsieur has rendered our house, in preserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal gratitude.”
He will inform against you.
Milady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to erect her batteries for the next day.
“If you are determined,” said Athos, “do so.”
It was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory.
They passed close by the unhappy being, who, concealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercédès dress brush past him, and his son’s warm breath, pronouncing these words:
“What next?”
“Silence!” cried the Gascon; “do not utter that name.”
“Who, then, are you?
Section 1.
You jest!
“I must confess to you, count,” said Danglars, “that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.
The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him, the shadow that haunted him by day and night.
“A confession!”
“Oh, not the least in the world, madame!
“En route, gentlemen.”
The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre, and were told they were all let.
“And on what floor does he live?” asked Comminges.
“You are right,” said she, “I have often thought of it.” Then she added in a low voice, “And I will think of it again.”
Besides, we will have no words about it.
I understand what you say!”
In his time they armed gentlemen, not disarmed them.
I declare, I expect to look magnificent in it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.”
“If your majesty desires it,” said Laporte, “my sons, like myself, are at the queen’s service.”
“It is some cowardly assassination,” said De Guiche.
“M.
D’Artagnan fancied quite naturally, according to his custom, that he must be the object of their conversation, and listened.
“As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal, no one will believe you anxious to follow me.”
“Lord Winter.”
Edmond had one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided.
“You alarm me; his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings.”
“As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.”
“Haven’t you, then, a fourth companion?”
Come to us this evening and to-morrow we’ll return your visit.”
“This is all very well,” murmured the king, “yes, this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair.
“Yes,” said Villefort, closing the door after him, “it is I, who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone.
“Providence still,” murmured he; “now only am I fully convinced of being the emissary of God!”
(“He were a dead man” said the Gascon, “if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment; but for my part, before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once; the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me.”
“Yes, my lord.”
I once loved her much, and to do her justice, she was very useful to us.
Should it not be found in possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the _Pharaon_.”
In dying, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron: ‘_Eo rus_, and all will be over.’ But come, Franz, take courage, your wife is an heiress.”
“A tempest from the Fronde Did blow to-day: I think ’twill blow Sieur Mazarin away.”
The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his hand, “Heaven be praised, and his Holiness also,” said he in a loud voice; “here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!”
“Tomorrow!” replied the steward.
“You are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet—”
“Zounds!
You, madame, have only sought to increase your own, and I am convinced that you have succeeded.
“Count,” he said, “you are not the same here as in Paris.”
I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs.
“Talking of that,” said Debray, “Madame was making inquiries about that house, which for the last three months has been hung with black.”
“Of what did he die?”
“Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!” added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh.
In the street of Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of Quinze-Vingts.
Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting.”
His delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip; he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell, and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency.
Between the forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped here.
“Nonsense!” exclaimed Guitant, with a burst of laughter; “those men must be poets.”
I am the friend of the great cardinal!”
A strange thing is the mind, and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign, a word, a hope.
“Have you not taken a bastion?” said a Swiss, who was drinking rum out of a beer glass.
It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort’s look,—that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.
“And since your return to England?”
Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed.
“I am ready.”
Rueil was crowded with advocates, presidents and councillors, who came from the Parisians, and, on the side of the court, with officers and guards; it was therefore easy, in the midst of this confusion, to remain as unobserved as any one might wish; besides, the conferences implied a truce, and to arrest two gentlemen, even Frondeurs, at this time, would have been an attack on the rights of the people.

The bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would have required a screw-driver to take them off.
Planchet!
“Do I know M. Debray?—do I wish to know him?—do I wish to know that he gives advice?—do I wish to follow it?—do I speculate?
Have I, sir, comprehended your instructions?”
“It is then a service which you propose to render us, count?” asked Anne of Austria, after a moment’s silence.
But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak of you.
“Follow him,” said Villefort to Dantès.
50189m
The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire; and, as often happens on such occasions, from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king.
Poor cardinal!
The carriage stopped.
What must the mistrustful, restless, suspicious cardinal think of her silence—the cardinal, not merely her only support, her only prop, her only protector at present, but still further, the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance?
Besides, Kitty will tell nothing; will you, Kitty?
“‘And I will say that you are the Sextus.
so much the better!
“Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?”
Dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the Château d’If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed.
“Yes,” said Porthos, “let us break the door in and fall upon him.”
The other leaned against a tree, supported there by the two valets, and was praying fervently, with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven.
We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring voraciously.
“Come, no hypocrisy!
“At the Louvre, August 10, 1628
He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity, and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs.
Bonacieux.
He was going to throw the crawfish out also, when Grimaud snatched it from his hands.
“Yes.”
You cannot for a moment imagine, D’Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward—”
This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity.
Chapter 105.
“Excellent.
“You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute.”
Villefort immediately despatched a messenger.
“However, what had you to say to me?” he resumed; “let us return to that subject.”
Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed.
They will return,” said D’Artagnan.
She sighed, as she looked at him.
“On my honor.”
“Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels?”
“Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone, and never practices in the presence of anyone.”
Mordaunt bowed humbly.
“Indeed!” replied Porthos, “who?”
“Where do you wish to be taken?” asked the president.—“Anywhere out of your presence,” replied M. d’Épinay.
“Laporte,” said the queen, “it is time for his majesty to go to bed.”
“Is the Comte de la Fere, sire,” said Aramis.
“Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting.”
“And where?
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, “this is more than I can bear.
The sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule.
Good-evening, M. de Morcerf.”
“Have you any friends?”
To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation?
“You?” exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach—“you, who have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen her die in my arms!
“It is very strange,” said Albert, “to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly to be saying to one’s self, ‘This is no fiction, it is all reality,’ in order to believe it.
“My dear,” said Villefort, in answer to his wife, “you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod.
The old man’s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.

The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate opened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet long by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the other by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.
I am of a frankness of character quite French.”
That which I have to say is too long, and above all, too secret.”
“He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.”
“It seems you are right, Planchet; all this appears to be a little mysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us.”
“Die?
You must set out for Boulogne.
Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves; the something rose, uttering an exclamation of astonishment, and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old, who was plucking strawberries, which he was placing upon grape leaves.
“Do you think of escaping in the same way?”
Scarron and Raoul laughed.
“Yes, my lord,” he replied.
Porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of Athos.
“Here I am,” said the young girl, who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely.
“A pen, a pen!” said the doctor.
“Both, sir?” asked Raoul, astonished.
“Yes.”
But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became contrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhône.
“I threw, and I lost.”
“I present to you,” he said, “Monsieur le Chevalier D’Artagnan, lieutenant of his majesty’s musketeers, a devoted friend and one of the most excellent, brave gentlemen that I have ever known.”
“All?”
His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand.
It will be happier, I think, than ours has been.
You have once before thrown yourself in my path.
“I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance.
“That she is called so?
“I cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.”
“Have you read the _Arabian Nights_?”
At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people.
Number 34 and Number 27 Chapter 16.
He appeared to foresee all, to divine all, to anticipate all.
D’Artagnan saw that the moment was come.
‘Ah,’ said I, after four hours’ work, ‘since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.’ ‘Is that the example you set, Penelon?’ cries the captain; ‘very well, wait a minute.’ He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.
“No,” said Caderousse, “no; I will not repent.
“My lord,” said Athos, “do not let us disturb you.
Once outside the city, D’Artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood.
This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours, then?”
“If it but lasts, most capital,” responded Porthos.
Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry, but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak.
Debray, Maximilian Morrel, and M. de Château-Renaud.”
He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major’s little finger; for the major, like a prudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them into an available asset.
Thus all my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to these three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Mercédès.
He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was finished.
“All at once, a tall, dark gentleman—just like yours, D’Artagnan.”
But as soon as it was finished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the brilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady’s diamonds, which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly.
From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he at length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart.
“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever forgotten.
Weigh your words before you speak, for my eyes have already become brighter, and my heart beats strongly; be cautious, or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies.
the queen, my sister, is no longer queen, my child.
“The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud, Hotel du Grand Roi Charlemagne.”
These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room.
“What?”
Was that it?”
Madame de Villefort fell at her husband’s feet.
I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not deceived.
“And you have heard his fortune mentioned?”
I confess it, but pardon to every sin!
“Oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame,” said the magistrate; “I will not dishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you have heard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold.”
Obey that person implicitly.
for I think you told me it was a boy, M. Bertuccio.”
“Your hands?” asked Grimaud.
“I will go,” said the monk.
I heard the Chevalier d’Herblay say so.”
Married at eighteen to M. Bonacieux, having always lived among her husband’s friends—people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position—Mme.
“The deputy.”
That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated.
Villefort’s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary.
An instant after Dantès entered.

“The discussion is going to begin again!” said Mme.
He hastened to descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence.
“Sir,” said Planchet, “you must know; but, perhaps you ought not to know——”
At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads.
“There remains the valise,” added Porthos.
“What does your worship want?” demanded the host, pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made.
Haydée is a very uncommon name in France, but is common enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example, Chastity, Modesty, Innocence,—it is a kind of baptismal name, as you Parisians call it.”
Selim made ready his lance.
Athos and D’Artagnan watched their approach from the window.
With a little more heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride.
Still, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.
He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.
“What have I to do with politics?
Chapter LXXXVII.
D’Artagnan smiled, but made no answer.
I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long—it will happen one day or the other.”
“Ah!
“Hush!” said D’Artagnan; “the some one is coming.”
“Holloa, there!” cried he; “what do you want, you strumpet?
“There is the true reason!
On her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at the first words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.
Misfortune refreshes the Memory.
“You grow a little too warm, in my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux.
“How so?”
I am no relation of yours.”
when one thinks that for twenty years, during which time I did not know what to do with myself, it never occurred to me to come to study Rueil.”
“That cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when threatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman when I met her for the first time, he whom I was seeking when I offended our Athos, he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux was abducted.
PS.
Franz smiled; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion.
“That is not enough madame, it is necessary that your friends should be also mine.”
“But,” interposed Monsieur de Chavigny, “it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de Pons.”
At the usual time, Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier’s room.
“Speak lower, Aramis,” said Athos.
Milady sprang toward him.
If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur d’Herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder, I could have spoken out.”
“And do you know what has become of him?”
“Yes, yes,” continued Lord de Winter, “I understand.
“There is the other,” replied the queen; “and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right,” she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him, “take and keep this ring in remembrance of me.
“Lieutenant d’Artagnan.”
General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared.
Indeed, as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack, the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall.
“Decidedly, Monsieur d’Artagnan, you are the man I have been seeking.
“Danglars, as well as the rest?”
His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body.
“What do you mean?” cried D’Artagnan.
Chapter XXIV.
“I understand,” said Athos smiling, “midnight.”
“On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.”
“It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood.”
The priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master, or rather, the mistress, replied: ‘Thank you, monsieur le curé, I accept.’ ‘Sup, then, and make as little noise as possible,’ said the priest, ‘for I, too, have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to-night.’”
Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish.
None, on my word!
The stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth, D’Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold of the door.
“And that is the only reply you make?
“If she caused his death—you said that she caused his death?”
He awaited Mazarin’s promised visit to get some light on his present situation.
Andrea arose.
“From an apoplectic stroke.”
How happy you are in being exempt from all this!”
You have only to remain in Paris for about a fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread the report.
“A thousand francs.”
“I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one,” said D’Artagnan.
Chapter XXXI.
Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation, and asked D’Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in England.
“The conduct is infamously violent!
“You forget, my dear, you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself.

“Is he not a count?”
“My brother’s carriage will be here first.”

“I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,—the happiness of my son.”
Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us so at your breakfast?”
I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is going.”
Milady then perceived, with terror, that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed.
The count, with outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion.
Each person’s attention was occupied.
“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI.
“Come,” said he to the abbé, “I am anxious to see your treasures.”
Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in France.
She turned pale, and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master.
“Then,” said the coadjutor, “this evening, at ten o’clock, and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal.”
“Magnificent, my dear fellow, magnificent!
“Let us visit them all,” said the inspector.
I’m hit in the other side!
He has been hanged and quartered, I hope.”
Afterward Mme.
Oh, no!” exclaimed Edmond, “that will not be.
Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her, and pressed closely against her guide, not uttering a syllable; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance, she endeavored to repress her emotion.
That will do; I will be there.”
What is it, Grimaud?
“Oh, your excellency, your excellency!” cried the steward, struck with terror at this threat, “if that is the only reason I cannot remain in your service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go to the scaffold.”
“Yes, of you.”
Daggers and swords were just about to shine, when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway, accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak.
They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine, and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade.
“He laid a wager he would tame Médéah in the space of six months.
“How is that, my friend?”
“Yes.”
“Ah, he’ll come round,” thought D’Artagnan; “that’s not bad!”

“I think they have some esteem for me,” said the mendicant with pride, “and that not only will they obey me, but wherever I go they will follow me.”
“I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies; because they fought against me; because I did them all the harm I could and they returned it to the best of their ability; because one of them, with whom I had most to do, gave me a pretty sword-thrust, now about seven years ago, the third that I received from the same hand; it closed an old account.”
“Yes, the third.”
“No, madame, I will not thus waste your time.
On seeing him D’Artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.
“Well,” said he to the young girl, “are you willing, my dear Kitty, that I should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?”
“Oh, mon Dieu!” cried the executioner, “I think I am dying.
“Do not attempt it; he has revenged himself and has done well.
“This idea occurred to me, and did not leave me; it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment.”
“But where is your master?”
Caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder.
From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage, and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready.
Unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine.
“Not locked,” he cried; “that is well.”
“I have both reflected and decided,” answered he.

Mazarin wished to call out, but Porthos held him tight and passed him to D’Artagnan, who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him; then in a menacing tone, he said:
“Can’t you guess, my dear Athos?
“‘Thou hast done well!’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice; ‘embrace me, my son.’
“No; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for Mousqueton—”
“Before tomorrow?—that will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides, I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.”
“Let us talk like men,” he said, looking at the count.
Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it.
D’Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in their formation.
“’Tis settled,” replied D’Artagnan.
After a moment’s interval, Cocles appeared.
“And if we do overtake him?”
“Teresa uttered a cry of admiration.
I sank on my knees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I was lost.”
Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred?
“Well, then, your eminence,” said the queen, “I must inform you that Charles I., my husband, is on the eve of a decisive engagement.
Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room, bursting with laughter.
“At the lesser gate of the castle; he’s posted there.”
VOLUME THREE Chapter 48.
If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”
On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis, the friends found a vast concourse of people.
If, on the other side, it was not she—which was still quite possible—for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy—might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?
It was necessary that D’Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber.
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him into a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing his toilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary attention.
Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of Orleans—that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned.
“You were; you know how I settled the matter.”
“Thanks, sire, thanks,” said the duke; “but your Majesty may be assured that it is not those—I do not speak of Monsieur de Tréville—whom your Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.”
After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.
But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared in their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young companion, drove them back.
“The story sent you from Yanina.”
“When did you first feel that?”
The night passed in perfect silence.
“What is that noise?”
“Three hundred francs?”
The count is an affable man; besides, he is unarmed; at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance.”
There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event; it is to these powers we should rally.”
D’Artagnan mounted the staircase, followed by his prisoner, who in his turn was followed by the soldier, and entered Mazarin’s ante-room.
“Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,” said the man with the red handkerchief, “but I want to speak to you.”
“And I, too,” added Aramis; “but you must not think of that, Athos; what is past, is past.”
“But,” asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness, “how could that prevent M. de Villefort——”
Unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a furious gesture.
Good God!
At this moment steps were heard in the ante-room and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door.
“What!
Thank God, thank God!”
“Madame,” said Villefort, “believe me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is not so easily renounced.”
He found his carriage at the door, and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp, who was in his office.
“Egad, I know where he is,” said D’Artagnan.
His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed.
Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance.
Then Monsieur de Beaufort, who was so familiar with the interior of the Palais Royal, though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal, pictured to himself, in his prison, all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister’s cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria: “Monsieur de Beaufort has escaped!” Whilst saying that to himself, Monsieur de Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside, breathing the air of the plains and the forests, pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice, “I am free!”
“He quietly said, ‘What do I care if I am?’”
Let us pursue him, and we shall overtake him!”
“Why is it not done already?”
At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her.
“She had a son, that unhappy woman?”
“I see they kept their promise.”
Directly afterwards the moon rose.
“I come to you, my leader, my head, my father, and I ask you, master, are you contented with me?”

“No; of the French Academy.”
“But whence does he derive the title of count?”
These animals, though wild and agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz could not consider them as game.
“Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?”
Well, Edmond, I swear to you, by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pity,—Edmond, for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold.
Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.
“In a house in the Allées de Meilhan, No.
The young man bowed.
The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on.
“At the house of M. de Morcerf.”
“In short, if I go, will you go too?”
“Yes, sir.” he said.
“What I have heard, then, from our good mother is true; you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest.”
“Ours, egad!” exclaimed Athos.
“She was no longer there, but she had left her new address.”
When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that, you come to Paris.”
“Who goes there?” cried a hoarse voice.
“Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of San-Felice’s daughter.
A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond.
“And very princely,” added Château-Renaud.
His sight was dimmed, his legs sank under him, and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him.
“But the dead cannot return their fire.”
“So I think,” replied D’Artagnan; “but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies; nevertheless, since they are the ones who have riches and honors, we are devoted to them.”
Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly.
“Your goodness confounds me, monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and I am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely—”
“Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay, No.
“You said, then, by the word of Bonacieux.
“I felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the serpent.
“Let him signal.”
As you pass the lodge, wake the porter, and send him for a surgeon.”
“Ah!” exclaimed De Guiche, “you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers, who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them; they are mostly foreigners—Scotch, Irish or Danish.
But a recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips.
“Well, and why should not you be free, too?
Anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the Prince de Condé, who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from Rueil, in whatsoever direction it might be.
“Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.”
Have I not my talent left?
The duke, more and more bewildered, let Grimaud loose and took the note.
He stooped, and with the most gracious air he could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the Musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out to him, said, “I believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose?”
“All the same, it is well to be certain.”
I’m beginning to feel queer!” cried Blaisois.
The color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his Eminence.
Ay, and observe—it just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham, and their preachers designate him as the Antichrist.”
“‘“Sir,” said the president, “you have been invited to join this assembly—you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come blindfolded—you accepted.
“Only remember——”
He will be delivered to the parliament, members of which can, of course, be bought, but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body.”
“But if I am not hungry?” said the young man.
He labored and toiled until he had amassed 250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object.
Villefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.
I accelerate your ruin?
“Oh,” said he, “is it you, captain?
Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.
She held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion.
After breakfast two letters arrived for Athos, who read them with profound attention, whilst D’Artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles, in one of which, there being at the time a very strong light, he perceived the fine writing of Aramis.
“Well, sir, I will obey you, although I do not understand you.”
“I have no greater regard for the Bastille than you.
Where—on the balcony?”
You are pale.”
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de Villefort; all I seek is happiness.”
Mazarin looked at her, and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts, he read her thoughts in her countenance, as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass—reflections, like thoughts, of the heavens.
“Yes.”
“I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them.
“In stock?”
“And the Spanish woman?”
“You smile.”
Each man had stabbed him separately, and, intoxicated by their crime, though still pale with fear, they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire, after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold.
Adieu, sir.”
“I am all attention.”
“Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,” replied Château-Renaud.
Already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht.
“I am sure of it.”

Athos is going to examine the castle, which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege; Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison.
Danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions, and who is rendered brave by fear.
“I am completely ignorant of it, madame,” said the cardinal, accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders; “alas, our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor, incapable, infirm old minister like me.”
“Imagine my astonishment,” continued Milady, “when I found myself face to face with this woman!”
“Without reckoning,” said Athos, “that if he had not rescued me from the hands of Cahusac, I should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your Majesty.”
It was thus with Milady.
“I believe so.”
“No,” replied Athos, with a singular smile.
“Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio?”
But even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally but too fatal.”
“We are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?” said the procurator, rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.
Oh, how feverish you are; we must not send for a notary, but for a doctor!”
“Let us understand each other,” said Albert; “it is agreed—is it not?—that you are to be at No.
“Well?”
If I were I should do for you at once the most that you deserve.
Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?”
“Alas,” stammered Villefort, “I do not lose a single word.”
He ran towards her.
The count’s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man.
1.A.
“Go to sleep soon, Louis,” said the queen, “for you must be awakened very early.”
“Yes, sire.”
“There is no harm in over-precaution.
I was expected at sharp midnight, and I am late.”
Jealousy, fury, offended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination, and above all, that D’Artagnan would also be lost to her forever.
“Sir, the favor I have to ask of you is, not to call me ‘Mousqueton’ but ‘Mouston.’ Since I have had the honor of being my lord’s steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me.
“A young man?
“Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?” asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.
Athos was the first to leave him, in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois; Porthos, the second, to marry an attorney’s wife; and lastly, Aramis, the third, to take orders and become an abbé.
Winter then left the tent; in the meantime the king finished his toilet.
“Very good,” thought D’Artagnan, “’tis our road likewise; we will go together.”
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, becoming angry again.
He had made up his mind to write to her the next day.
“What!
“Well, then, wretches,” cried Danglars, “I will defy your infamous calculations—I would rather die at once!
You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are a Gascon, and the second is that you are my son.
And you really mean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?”
And yet it is very hard,” added she, “that a man upon whose affection I thought I might depend, treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies.”
“What next?
And the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer, “Sinbad the Sailor.”
“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words.
Oh, merciful heavens, was I not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for him, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer?
The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water, and the rider, who had lost the reins in struggling, fell with his head back and his arms extended.
“My king,” said Aramis, “they well may raise a scaffold, but they cannot make an executioner.”
If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.
“By a tailor, a coachmaker, a brewer!
And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?
“No, sir!
In a moment they were at the Canebière.
“The cable is cut!” he cried, “no boat!”
A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of his heart, that he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only caressed till he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs.
Albert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm.
“From Heaven,” replied D’Artagnan, shaking his head; “you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there.”
The Scotchman.
“I go,” he said, “only, shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are?”
Do you know what that warning was?”
my mother,” cried Mordaunt, with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint, “I can only offer thee one victim, but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen!”
It is only shown to me to terrify me, that’s all.’ You are mistaken.
“Where do we sleep, colonel?”
“Well, that’s something, for I have not the shadow of one,” said Athos coolly; “but as to D’Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to _ours_ has driven him out of his senses.
Monte Cristo listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness.
“Ah!
“Madame,” said he at length, “I pray you to excuse my emotion, which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here; but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband.”
do you see?” cried the lieutenant.
D’Artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit, but Porthos did not even look toward him.
Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.
“But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.”
Perhaps God will pardon you, but I, never!”
But you are not the king, my son, and can never be so while they are alive.
I drew my knife from my pocket again, opened it, and made ready to strike.
and then must not all be over?
“That would be to charge Monsieur de Séguier, the keeper of the seals, with this mission.
“What?”
Grimaud fell—precipitated into the moat.
So, without losing time, tell me, have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?”
“That is but fair,” replied Monte Cristo.
“What next, madame?”
“Sign, my Lord!”
Parry, who accompanied him, stood behind him.
“I go out?” he said.
“The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to humanity.
“I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held.
1.D.
“Be satisfied,” replied D’Artagnan; “the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what I have to tell.”
For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow.
But what can I do with you?
“Now,” said the count, “let us follow him.”
He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive orders.
In the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are cigars—contraband, of course—try them, and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves.”
You understand this, do you not, my most precious wife?
“Give way,” said the traveller.
“You put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the door, and run as I told you.”
“Do you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges?
“Oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, I would fight a duel for a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man.
At this moment a patrol passed by.
Breathing that sea breeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to combat alone—she, a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared herself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots, horses, men, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke.
At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers.
The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence, whilst that of Aramis, which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill-humor, irritated him.
0019m
With some gentleman who was traveling this way, to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet_.”
The days of expectation are long, and D’Artagnan, in particular, would have wagered that the days were forty-four hours.
The insult was terrible, and although unknown to the rest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart.
“I think,” replied Porthos, “it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again; it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way, and a failure would be ruinous.
I don’t very well know what, but still something.”
Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and, unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up Albert’s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.
Anybody may possess a five-franc piece.”
“Eight or ten.”
“Let us examine the enemy’s army.”
“What’s the manner?” cried Athos.
It was the queen!
“I swear to you again, rather than betray you, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!”
“To me, to you, to us!
Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure.
Then, after seeing her eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she had dropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door after him with the utmost precaution.
She read:
D’Artagnan did not budge.
“No?
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage.
Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests.
The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired.
I believe that this singular man, who appears to fathom the motives of everyone, has purposely arranged for me to meet M. and Madame de Villefort, and sometimes, I confess, I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love.”
“Capital—nothing!” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile.
Ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers.”
My God!
He pointed his finger to the lighted window.
Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.
There remained in the banker’s house only Danglars, closeted in his study, and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes; Madame Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we are acquainted; and Eugénie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.
“You seek me, sir,” said he.
“Really?” said Franz.
Ha, ha, ha!”
Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela.
No, sir.
At the letter S the old man stopped her.
“Yet,” continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Mercédès had accepted, “yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love, or rather delirium.
He jumped out of bed and ran to the window.
And he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked nothing better than to believe him, did believe him.
Moreover, he had this advantage, he was master of the count’s secret, while the count had no hold on Franz, who had nothing to conceal.
D’Artagnan believed him to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point into D’Artagnan’s breast, crying, “One for you!”
Caderousse looked at him with amazement.
The young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when they had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued to do so.
And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner.
A mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment.
“Well, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things.”
“She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!”
I have asked for no leave of absence.”
Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count’s heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat.
“I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore,” said Monte Cristo; “think again,—do you not recollect me?”
As soon as the door was closed:
“It would be a difficult matter to arrange,” said Monte Cristo.
“Then indeed we are lost!” cried the queen, in the fullness of a broken heart.
Nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past?”
“Or he will forget us,” added D’Artagnan.
Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing.
It is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune—at least, so it is said—and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely repeat;—it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world.”
A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of D’Artagnan and Mme.
If, when you arrive at Cours la Reine, you find no one, you must go on to Saint Germain.
“Go to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.”
“Well, sir?” he said.
“And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.”
“Sir,” said Beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, “you appear to accuse the count, who is absent from Paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself.”
“Why?” asked Blaisois.
“Madame, madame!” cried Valentine, calling her step-mother, and running upstairs to meet her; “come quick, quick!—and bring your bottle of smelling-salts with you.”
“Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!”
“You said just now that you had a hundred friends.”
“Listen, Louise.
“I ask pardon of your eminence,” said D’Artagnan, “but I was so fatigued——”
Mazarin bent low before her.
“This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor, my lord; the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything.”
Well, then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson.”
In the meanwhile I am a Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me.”
“Well, I will take it, then,” said D’Artagnan.
“Come,” he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife’s room, “nothing is changed here.”
Athos, therefore, commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same manner.
“What I require is, that justice be done.
“Ah, you think very lightly of it; I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house.”
Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other.
We render service to God, madame, in serving a prince so unfortunate, a queen so virtuous.
Be brave, faithful and loyal,” he said, “You are brave, faithful and loyal.
You see I give you a wide range.
“My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,” replied the inspector; “keep them until you are liberated.” The abbé’s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector’s hand.
I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him; had it not been for an adverse destiny, that beloved monarch would this day have been among us.”
My honor will not survive it!
The moment of your deliverance is at hand; have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained.
“Not before me, behind me.”
“By whom, then, were we beaten?” asked Porthos.
Dispose of me, then, as a friend.”
Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking.
Ah!
Is monsieur your brother?” said D’Artagnan, not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing.
“Yes, were it only out of curiosity.”
Bonacieux.
Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.”
Each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.
“You know that I am not alluding to you; you are the pearl of brave, bold men.
How happy I am!”
look!” cried the king, drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk, which threw it on its haunches, and seizing the bridle of Athos’s horse.
“That M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does.”
D’Artagnan himself was moved by them.
He lighted it and retired.
“Some traveller seems impatient,” said the host.
“Speak, sir,” replied the queen; “the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available.”
“I think so,” answered Albert in a firm tone.
“Come, Louise,” said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend.
“His things and his bag are with him?
thou man of noble heart; woe is me!
Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence.
This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same direction.
“My father is king’s attorney,” replied Andrea calmly.
Madame de Lannoy, whom, according to your Majesty’s command, I have frequently interrogated, told me this morning that the night before last her Majesty sat up very late, that this morning she wept much, and that she was writing all day.”
“It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fête?”
Let us try not to jest, if we can.
Do I regret life?
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said he, “if you please, we will join our friends; as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again, expecting that you will be rich in your turn.”
“By thieves.”
“Yes.—in the principality, but not in the prince.”
Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of Saint-Méran; I say hers, for she inherits it today.
“But, my dear friend, put yourself in my place,” replied the Musketeer.
At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_.
Grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it.
I took a week to go, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours to stay there; that makes three weeks.
But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,” added he with a smile, “she will take her own.” So saying, he leaped into a boat, desiring to be rowed on board the _Pharaon_, where M. Morrel had agreed to meet him.
“You know that you are, madame,” said Villefort, whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance.
Emmanuel went towards the pistols.
The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape; he called out his name and cried for help.
Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked towards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token.
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart, one of the Guardsmen fell.
While waiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son should live, have you not?”
That little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers.”
“If that is the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum.”

Raoul didn’t wait to be told twice; he knew that with superiors, especially when those superiors are princes, the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument; he went down to the stables, picked out a pie-bald Andalusian horse, saddled and bridled it himself, for Athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger, and went to rejoin the prince, who at that moment mounted his horse.
The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends.
“Nor I,” said Athos.
“Is there any answer?” inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.
It is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full application.”
“For what purpose?”
“I think,” returned Anne of Austria, fixing upon him a glance, which in any woman’s face would have expressed disdain, but in a queen’s, spread terror to those she looked upon, “nay, I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign.”
On their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege, were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life.
“Oh, yes,” he cried, “that was my only prayer at last; I no longer begged for liberty, but memory; I dreaded to become mad and forgetful.
“It is a matter of indifference to me,” said Aramis; “I came here only to meet De Chatillon; I have met him, I am contented; ’tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel!”
“Yes, sir.”
“Certainly, madame,” said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.
“If I should not be in, wait for me.”
I have,” returned Guitant.
Aramis was right; they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine; they gave them three hours’ rest and then set off again.
“Then Monsieur takes his horse back again,” said the Englishman.
“Indeed, sir,” continued the stranger, more calm than ever; “well, that is perfectly right!” and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the hostelry by the front gate, beneath which D’Artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse.
The joy of the king was lively.
“Come,” she added.
“Still my three brave fellows!” murmured the cardinal.
“From Tours!” cried Aramis.
“Taste some of this ham, D’Artagnan; it is exquisite,” said Athos, cutting a slice, which he placed on the young man’s plate.
“The president paused, and the count turned pale.
“What is that?”
At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis, and stopped underneath the window which had light in it.
That has weakened my purse.”
“Yes,” said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity, “but is it not to have me hanged?”
“Perhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there will be four.”
But the more the young woman excused herself, the more important Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him.
The footman obeyed his orders.
There are the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Longueville, the Duc de Beaufort, the Duc de Bouillon, the Marechal de la Mothe, the Marquis de Sevigne, and I don’t know who, for my part.”
I heard the door open and shut, and I remained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself.
The Man in the Mask.
Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness?
“Very well.”
“I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures.
Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the spot, I assure you.”
“Oh!” said Scarron, “he may die now.”
Pray tell me how it happened.”
He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and conducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti.
“Just so,” returned Franz, “you have guessed it.”
“Well,” replied Athos, “have you not heard what D’Artagnan said?”
“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”
“Well, but put on this dressing gown first,” said the Musketeer to his friend.
“Well,” asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, “tell me what it is?”
At first, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.
D’Artagnan, half stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs; but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two large Norman horses.
The city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the mutineers.
“_If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands, by seven o’clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live_.”
The unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, “I told you well that she would know me.
What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously.
“Pray, Signor Pastrini,” asked Franz, “is not some execution appointed to take place today?”
“Yes, but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris.
“There,” said he, “it’s done.
“And grandpapa?” inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.
D’Artagnan ran after her.
“However,” said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind, “perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to M. d’Épinay, in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villefort.”
At three paces from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled.
I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it has not always been consistent.
We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united.
“Ah, then you at length understand?”
But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him on foot.
As he was finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard, and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his attention.
“When I am your wife.”
“Athos,” said the Musketeer.
“I know it.”
My faith!
those who love me, follow me!”
“Tell me their names; perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them.”
Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter.
If I only were a——”
The Abbé D’Herblay.
“Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I can tell you.
“And you will always love him?”
“How could that be, monsieur?
“Have we come to any?”
“She was not at home.
Porthos rested his chin on his hands, placed his elbows on the table and looked at D’Artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good-fellowship.
“And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?”
“Himself!”
“Well, my poor friend,” replied Beauchamp, “I expected you.”
“Stop!
“Thou seest, simpleton,” said D’Artagnan to his servant, “that they wished no harm to us.”
“M.
“Four devoted, resolute men can do much, assure yourself, madame; and those of whom I speak performed great things at one time.”

We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with tears.
But what happened after my departure?”
Do not forget that.
All this savors of his Eminence, a league off.”
I have a sure method of limbering tongues.
“Thank you,” said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven.
“What am I to do?” she said, bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant.
“Bah,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “that’s a fine reason to give.
“And you would act rightly.
The king went out, accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin, bearing the candlestick, and then the queen returned to her own apartment.
“No.”
Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?”
“All my oil is lost!”
or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!”
“Tell it, Athos, tell it.”
“Discontented, sir!
You speak of him very much at your ease, Aramis; he has probably been killed.
“Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,” continued Beauchamp.
“The door is locked.”
“What did your excellency say?” inquired the other.
“Ah, yes,” said Monte Cristo smiling; “it is all a matter of imagination.
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many-colored scarves, whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles.
D’Artagnan did the same.
“I will not promise,” said Milady, “for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep it.”
“That’s all that is necessary,” said Athos; “now for my idea.”
Dantès did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him.
On the other hand, he was about to land, without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed, a very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits.
The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits.
“This affair does not, then, weigh upon your conscience?”
We will take possession of it and cut the cable.
“Hurry, hurry!” said Andrea, “we must overtake him soon.”
“My first impressions were favorable to the minister; I said to myself that a minister is never loved, but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared, which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved——”
What do you intend to do?
“At your ball.”
“Yes, it’s true.
“Shall I find you here, then?”
“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.
taste this, and in an hour you will be a king, not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France, Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth.
She had only one day left.
Bertuccio appeared.
“Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?”
“I begin to think so, particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal.”
“Very well, let us go,” said Caderousse; “but I don’t want your arm at all.
She is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist another like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure you, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf.
“A handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild, amiable, and well made?”
“’Tis well, we will see if the king’s name is not a passport everywhere,” replied the Gascon.
“His name?” asked the queen.
They parted, laughing, she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest, he looking after her with eyes of love.
“I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,” replied the countess, “and those who are here will complain of but one thing, that of its too rapid flight.”
“Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere?” said Monte Cristo.
Lord Winter was seated near an aperture, arranged as a window to let in the night air, his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon, intermittently veiled, as we before observed, by heavy clouds.
fire!
“No; I only brought you here to ask you,” returned Mazarin, smiling, “if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers?”
The count praised Bertuccio’s zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure, as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a month.
He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.”
“Yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking impudently at the youth; “I have taken the whim into my head; do you understand, Master Benedetto?”
An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation.
“An enemy!” cried Mercédès, with an angry look at her cousin.
One of my friends—one of my friends, please to observe, not myself,” said Athos, interrupting himself with a melancholy smile, “one of the counts of my province—that is to say, of Berry—noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.
“Madame de Saint-Méran’s last request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must I let things take their course?” Noirtier did not move.
“You want the cardinal to come here?”
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the wound.
Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment.
ho!” said he, “good advice, advice of a friend.
An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb.
Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other.
“I knew it from the fountain-head—from Planchet.
The arts change about and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the vulgar do not follow them—that is all; but there is always the same result.
What to do?”
“A garden with two acres of land!”
Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville, which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night.
We shall serve in a campaign, seek out all sorts of adventures—return, in short, to our former life.”
Soon the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea.
“At two o’clock.”
“Yes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.”
“At the very moment when I was about to pay you, I had placed my purse on the table.”
The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was favorable.”
Grimaud, finding that his master had been arrested, fell back into the ranks near Aramis, without saying a word and as if nothing had happened.
This time it was not a host but a hostess who received him.
‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another step.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the figure.
As for Monte Cristo, his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude.
He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price.
And Morrel was right, for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal.
Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested, the instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the Musketeers.
M. de la Trémouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.
Sometimes, when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit, the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians, all fully armed, appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison.
“There now, again you degrade me.”
“Well, I shall see.
Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre, where they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu—the French minister, the national minister—would be ruined.
“And shall we arrive there?”
“To Mademoiselle Valentine?”
“This is serious,” answered the three friends; “it is a family affair.
The French army held all between Pont-a-Marc as far as Valenciennes, falling back upon Douai.
He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick moustache.
She allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves—that immense breaking of the ocean—with her pure, harmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the Puritans:
“A favor from me?”
“Oh,” exclaimed Haydée, “is it not yet over?”
Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman.
“Mademoiselle Danglars?”
“It was the fault of their horses, not theirs.”
He turned.
“Do you say,” asked the Gascon, timidly, “that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself?”
“As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,” replied Maximilian.
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder.
“But,” asked Morrel, “will the house of Thomson & French consent?”
They were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.
So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness.”
There, disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs.
“Now let us go.”
Bonacieux.
Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor, that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?”
Athos recognized Grimaud.
Yes, as you said, you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you.
He called Porthos to look at it.
Again, the moderate fortune which Athos possessed, concealed as it was, so skillfully, seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused.
“‘To the world’s end.’
“Listen,” said the baroness, smiling; “speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be.
An innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad.
“Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself!
Dantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand.
His devotion, and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and this was now strengthened by gratitude.
If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person; and that, you know, is Fernand.
Have no more concern about me; I exist no longer for you, any more than if you had never seen me.”
“And do you understand them?”
The count, however, has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days’ rest, with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that is as terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday.
End of the Port Wine Mystery.
“Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life, and since an opportunity presents itself——”
As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the sick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little Edward.
The officer who commanded the post of the Red Cross was sent for, and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos was then lodged in Fort l’Evêque.
“The hôtel, then, is far away?”
The young king leaned toward the door.
“That is our brave Musketeer, I think,” said the cardinal.
Planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but the horses were all used up.
“Oh, merciful Heavens!” murmured Villefort.
“That’s my concern; I will make him speak.”
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with fright.
“True,” said D’Artagnan.
“But they have corresponded; it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day.
“Oh,” replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, “the prosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart, I pray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy.
“I am to be a soldier then?” said the young man.
if I knew that he did I should know all.”
“That’s agreed; you have my word.”
At this moment the door of the minister’s box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to their seats.
I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I am still owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference.
“Dantès,” repeated he, “Edmond Dantès.”
“Not even to your mistress?”
Villefort caught his arm.
Long swords but light purses.
“It is I,” said Athos, “and what is the name of the person?”
“I listen.”
The vicomte and myself will go and find a priest.”
Some ham, my boy, or we can’t drink.”
Are you ambitious?
So much the better; it proves that we know how to keep our secrets.”
“Thank you, gentlemen,” replied Albert, with a smile of indifference; “I shall follow your advice—not because you give it, but because I had before intended to quit France.
“Why?” said Gaetano with a smile.
“Tell me,” continued he, “was he not about my height, perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?”
Who has paid me this attention?”
“The count.”
Mazarin resumed his reading:
He was the worst Musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable.
an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves.
“You may make your mind easy,” said the doctor; “he is dead.
D’Artagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive; then, as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant, they sheathed their swords.
“I am called,” said Andrea.
Is he afraid of me or of his father?
“Here, my Lord, here,” said she, “keep this in memory of me.”
“My dear fellow,” said Albert, turning to Franz, “here is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and double-barrelled guns.
“Ah!
And you?”
Villefort burst it open with a violent blow.
It was, then, in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate.
“You did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself, I shall know if you have told me the truth.”
“No, indeed,—I am calm,” said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; “my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual.
“Chevalier,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “you could eat a piece of Mouston, couldn’t you, especially after two or three days of fasting?”
“Would anything retain you particularly in Paris?”
“Yes,” said Valentine, “he was very fond of me.”
“Well,” said Porthos, “this is my advice—”
“Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person you please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding.
He made haste to pass out by the opening, still thinking himself in a dream; but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare.
He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter, signed “Baronne Danglars, _née_ Hermine de Servieux.”
This was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this was, in case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions.
“Very good,” said the prince, understanding the reason of that ignorance; “the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery; he might have purchased his life by speaking; he doesn’t wish to speak.
“Certainly; go on.”
It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather Frenchwoman—for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have not questioned her.”
It was a mistake.”
“Were you present during the last struggle?” asked M. d’Avrigny.
help!”
D’Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.
So, if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first——”
“Oh, I recollect him perfectly,” cried M. de Boville; “he was crazy.”
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to D’Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, “Monsieur, I have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening.”
But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night?
“The king’s room?” cried Athos.
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood.”
Its purple visage, and its violet-colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.
“How is King Otho getting on?” asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.
Athos killed his adversary first.
“And why, I should like to know,” persisted Caderousse, “should they put Dantès in prison?
Valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying.
“That’s well, Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal; “pray let that napkin be sent to me.
“What do you want?
“Egad!
“Have the goodness to send mine to Athos’s residence.
HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII.
“And he did not see Raoul?” asked Athos.
“What may that be?”
“What vessel is that?” asked Milady.
She knew her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold hunter, an intrepid player, enterprising with women, but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues.
Raoul, without dismounting, called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful.
Hey!
“Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of race, which should arrive first.
Porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure of Chantilly, played with skill and prudence.
Villefort’s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire.
As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low tone:
At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head, but it was too late.
1.E.9.
He then gave his friends minute directions as to their route.
The old servant came.
There was, to be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as the cardinal’s familiar was called.
“Yes,” said Madame Danglars, “that is she.
“Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness?—why, we cannot tell.
At the same time the fever, which for an instant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to her cheeks, and vermillion to her lips.
On one of those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of Paris, who ran after any sort of favor—gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing and carrying messages between their masters and M. de Tréville.
I cannot hear such things said as that; this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king!
But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion?
Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes, under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth, and had procured a whole holiday from Bazin.
“What, you, count?” said Madame Danglars, signing; “if you are, take care, for I shall never forgive you.”
“It is impossible,” said Comminges; “the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant.”
“At ten o’clock.”
You were among them—you were!
I am mistaken?”
Porthos had his fits.
The article was not inserted by me—I was not even aware of it; but you have, by the step you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph in question, and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so.”
“Madame, I have never been false to my word; when I say I will not do a thing, I mean it.”
The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity; the thirty-two horses, dispersed over seven stages, brought them to their destination in eight hours.
But to you, D’Artagnan, I am, I hope, still dear Athos, your comrade, your friend.
The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars at the other, and Eugénie in front of him.
Then sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:
Have we relations with the court?
15, ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father.
He questioned him, and as the boy had no interest in deceiving, D’Artagnan learned that he exercised, from six o’clock in the morning until nine, the office of chorister, and from nine o’clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern.
“Eighteen thousand men and thirty-six cannon.”
Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily.
He believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he saw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his commissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was ready to embrace them both.
Nevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths.
Planchet, prouder than ever of his new duties, deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place Royale with two hundred men, forming the rear of the army of Paris, and to march on Charenton when necessary.
The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others, in case of pursuit.
It was about four o’clock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne; there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them.
M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.
The morning’s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby-tinted light.
Order; I am ready.”
You do not know these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers.
Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the telegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count reached the tower of Montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the highest point of the plain of that name.
Has anything particular happened in the neighborhood?
It would have required the penetration of Œdipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words, apparently uttered with the greatest politeness.
Under the oldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle.
“Do you hear nothing?” whispered Planchet.
“And who is the person whom you suspect?”
“We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.”
“Something of this I heard in Epirus,” said Monte Cristo; “but the particulars are still unknown to me.
“He was found in your lodging; they took him for you.”
Then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:
We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece of advice; take care of yourself, Monsieur d’Artagnan, for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an _obolus_ for your life.”
Perhaps you would prefer being alone?”
“Oh, unfortunate creature!
“My friend,” said Athos, “he has given me news of Raoul.”
“I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not.
D’Artagnan and Porthos obeyed.
There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son.
I know you are not quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.
He knew his time well—the hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty.
“Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field, the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself.
“Ah,” said Monte Cristo, “1815 is not yesterday.”
“Without that, what would become of me?”
In five minutes they gained the land.
Give up this letter you have brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and rejoin your friends.
“I have your word, then?”
“I was not deceived,” said he; “here is Monsieur d’Artagnan; and you are his friends, Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”
Athos remained alone in the vast chamber, where, according to the cardinal’s directions, he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman.
Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him.
My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard—I am a cosmopolite.
Then all was dark again.
“Doubtless.
“She remembered that she had a son,” said he; “and I forgot I had a daughter.” Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, “Poor Haydée,” said he; “she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared or guessed something.

“Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!”
“What think you of that?” inquired Franz.
He was superintending the grooming of his horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the count’s carriage stopped at the gate.
At the sixth cabaret, then, as we said, D’Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again his hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his ears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which passed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him.
“Well, what is it—what is going on here?” said he, in a jeering voice, on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out.
“You may retire; we consent to that.
As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land.
Either I misunderstand you or you are very shameless!”
[5] Scott, of course: “The son of an ill-fated sire, and the father of a yet more unfortunate family, bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death.”—The Abbot, ch.
A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this announcement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her resentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her countenance.
“That is true,” said D’Artagnan, “let us call the others.”
“That it is no longer a riot, madame,” he replied, “but a revolt.”
The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on.
“I cannot consent that this woman should die thus!”
“Where forbidden?” asked Mousqueton.
“Suddenly?”
“It was five o’clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room, and waited for night.
“Au revoir.
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not exceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to M. de Tréville.
It appears that after having challenged M. de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground today.”
“Never.”
“Be assured,” answered Mazarin, “that I shall attempt nothing; I give you my word of honor.”
“True,” said Monte Cristo, “the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your philosophic spirit.”
old woman!” screamed Nanette.
“I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning.”
“Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period, when I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.”
“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars.
“I think, monsieur le comte, that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of Bragelonne, and that gentleman”—he pointed to Aramis—“had also something to tell me when I was in his convent.
“I shall be at your orders,” said Monte Cristo bowing.
I am John Francis de Winter,” he repeated, “and that woman——”
“But you may use it,” replied Lord Wilmore; “I understand it.”
“Reply to them, my Lord,” said Felton; “the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe.”
At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, “A letter from France, my Lord.”
“My dear Aramis, you have the pen of a secretary of state.
“My uncle,” answered Mordaunt; “but traitors to England are no longer members of my family.”
He was introduced.
The result was, that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.
And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself, gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard.
“From the queen,” replied the servant.
Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the _Pharaon_, under bare poles.”
M. Noirtier de Villefort Chapter 59.
Porthos maintained a majestic silence.
“Yes; madame and I were there two years ago.
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.
His disposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them) kept him aloof from all friendships.
Well, for my part, I, a bloodthirsty ruffian, who can go and stand close to a scaffold, in order to have a better view of the king’s execution—I remain.”
“Alas,” returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity, “we ought always to help one another.
Besides, that does not concern the home but the financial department.
“Stop—an idea!” cried Porthos; “indeed, my dear D’Artagnan, I don’t know how you manage, but you are always full of ideas; let us go and embrace Raoul.”
Paternal Affection.
“The spade, perhaps.”
“Oh, don’t let that disturb you,” cried Mme.
“It is true,” said the baroness, with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them,—“it is very true that had not the Morcerfs hesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert.
Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying.”
Do you understand?”
“In that case,” replied the abbé, “he should be a man blessed of God, rich, happy.”
Time, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to awaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner.
“My dear friend,” said the cardinal, leaning, as they walked through the garden, on his friend’s arm, “you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen’s service.”
D’Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the following week.
“Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning?”
“_Au revoir_, then; that is all I have to say today.
This formal announcement, which implied or appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted.
Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?”
D’Artagnan bowed to Mme.
However, accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian life—a life of politeness, visiting, and introductions.”
“I will answer for everything.”
Rochefort and D’Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.
“But in the meantime saves the country,” added Athos.
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I shall discover them; as these secrets may have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine.”
“No, if it does not lighten.”
“Poor creatures!” said Athos, “who are going to be killed, in order that Monsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him, that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort, and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal.”
Grimaud was left alone with the executioner, who in a few moments opened his eyes.
“She was forced to return to Tours; she is not faithless; she still loves me!
Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs apiece for his horses.
Morrel had long thought of Danglars, but had kept away from some instinctive motive, and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource.
“I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Château-Renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance.”

I must confess that I was mistaken.
“Good,” said Milady to herself; “without thinking what it is, he calls it a crime!” Then aloud, “The friend of that wretch is capable of everything.”
“My friend,” said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal to his own, “listen to me.
“Ah, sir!” cried the countess, “how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit!—for I am the only culprit, Edmond, and if you owe revenge to anyone, it is to me, who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude.”
However, I swear I was not guilty, I swear it by——”
The young people uttered a cry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again immediately.
I have lent him to a friend——”
Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance in quick time.
The Inquiry Chapter 70.
“Whom shall I announce?” said the attendant.
“How?”
Buckingham gave D’Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own.
The king was already sanguine, but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy.
“If I give you time!” cried the duke, spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword.
“Then you had better come with me.”
“You see, then, why I must decline your polite invitation, which is especially attractive to me, because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person; the chances always balance and at the month’s end nothing is gained or lost.”
“Bah,” said Caderousse, “when you have access to countless stores.”
I shall not go.”
Madame de Villefort was dead.
Besides, the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That.
The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer.
And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible.
The Battle of Charenton.
“Yes; a young man who loved her.”
“Who made the lemonade?”
“Maximilian,” said the count, “the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts, and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them.
THE WIFE OF ATHOS
Albert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword.
Then from the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.
by Jove, my lord,” said D’Artagnan, “you have well said, but these are only words.
“What,” said the count, “do you still regret anything in the world, and yet die?”
Morcerf took his hat, and left the room.
With you, D’Artagnan, with you, Porthos—all four reunited for the first time for twenty years—we would dare not only England, but the three kingdoms put together!”
“Gentlemen,” cried Aramis, “listen to this.”
“How, you will go!” said Mme.
“Yes, fair lady!” replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous, half ironical; “it is I, myself.”
Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, “The chief, the chief!”
“She will soon get over these things.” So saying, Madame de Saint-Méran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law’s respectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as to say, “I must try and fancy ’tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.”
But at the very moment when D’Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, “S’blood, he shall not escape me this time!”
Some time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general.
Monsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your friend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting with his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it.”
“May I be hanged,” said Danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner through the crevices of the door,—“may I be hanged if I can understand how people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.
“We will be with you at six o’clock, my lord.”
“We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale,” said the wounded man.

“If I judge for myself, my lord,” she said, “the cardinal will do nothing, and will even, perhaps, act against us.
“I had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.
Rare birds, retaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon massive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the Archipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,—all these, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians, who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls, like Cleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo de’ Medici.
But stop!
The young count, witty and caustic, passed all the world in review; the queen herself was not spared, and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule.
“‘Now, then,’ cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and approaching the corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols, ‘does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me?’
“Monseigneur,” said Athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply, “the letter is a woman’s letter, but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme, nor Madame d’Aiguillon.”
Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of Buckingham.
“The one between the pillars on the first tier—it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh.”
“Yes, my lord, and I feel the whole responsibility of such a charge.”
No, positively I will not go.
“And you, too,” said he, “come, if you like, monsieur; you have a claim, being almost one of the family, and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them.”
Twice you have pronounced that word!”
“Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.
No reply.

“Oh, you are an angel!” exclaimed the young man.
“Farewell, my son,” said the curate, “till tomorrow.”
“Bernajoux, at your service.”
“No, Maximilian, I am not offended,” answered she, “but do you not see what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in my father’s house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for, even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself.
“And don’t you know where he is?”
Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds.
Close to him, dressed in entirely new clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son, whom we also know.
Let us do justice to D’Artagnan.
Every few minutes he turned around, and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves.
“And why not?” said Monte Cristo coldly.
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in.
“Your grandfather knows, then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.
_Peste!_ I thought you somewhat Corsican, a great deal smuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have other strings to your bow.
“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”
“And therein consisted the infamy,” replied Milady.
“It is only the dead who do not return.”

“This temporary sepulture is,” he said, “that of a man who was of feeble mind, yet one whose reign was full of great events; because over this king watched the spirit of another man, even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it.
“We have the gates.”
“Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,” said Franz, “to ask you the particulars of this kindness?”
Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Château d’If, but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume.
The officer entered, a large fat man, with an open physiognomy.

‘You can sleep here.’
“So much the better,” cried Porthos.
I was compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition; I reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.
“Athos, you are not in your right senses, I swear.”
On the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having reappeared, M. de Tréville was informed by D’Artagnan and Porthos of the circumstance.
“The cargo on board?”
I only ask you one favor; and if you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in the next.”
He mentioned this to Gaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a good fire to roast them by.
Why was not M. de Saint-Méran also grandfather to Mademoiselle Danglars?”
I have never been understood, and no wonder.
I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics.
Then, I confess, curiosity mingled with hatred; I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there, and I remained motionless, holding my breath.
“Every one, madame.”
Never had Anne of Austria appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fêtes, or carousals, as she appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white satin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania—the only one of her Spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of Richelieu.
He found Tréville in a joyful mood.
“But pray, sir,” continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, “do not say that Athos is wounded.
“Yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king’s Musketeers—one of whom was wounded—and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal’s Guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.”
Bonacieux; that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at about ten o’clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M. d’Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Tréville’s, where he had dined.
Milady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and then returned and seated herself close to Mme.
“I asked you,” continued Villefort, in a perfectly calm tone, “where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father-in-law, M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, and my daughter Valentine.”
Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the contrary, Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover.
But he does wrong to use his privilege.
D’Artagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos, still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed.
“Open; it is I.”
“The symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous spasms, excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres.
Oh, if you refuse my advice——”
“And what will she do now?” asked the young man.
“Oh, Faria, Faria, how well did you judge men and things!”
“Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion.
“Now to horse, that I may see you depart!”
When they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.
The road was long, but the horses upon which D’Artagnan and Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of Bracieux; the master and servant rode side by side, conversing as they went, for D’Artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant.
“Why, yes, very nearly.”
Speak, my friend; I listen.”
Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage.
“But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?” said Beauchamp.
He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric, and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way.”
D’Artagnan bowed with respect.
“What is the matter, my lord?” said Athos, “and what puts you out of breath thus?”
“A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could reckon back to the _Divina Comedia_.”
“Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten.
D’Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms.
Maximilian tried to speak, but he could articulate nothing; he staggered, and supported himself against the wainscot.
“Ah,” said Buckingham, “God be praised!
“You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long that arrest lasted.
“Real?” interrupted the count, smiling.
But, D’Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him.
“By the way,” said the major, “you know I have only the 2,000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses, and——”
My father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her.
Mademoiselle Danglars’ charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men, and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor.

Lord de Winter came toward five o’clock in the evening.
“And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?”
Cæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers; there is a will.’
“Ah, it’s all over!
Ask Porthos.
“I know nothing about it myself.
There’s only the price we are not agreed about.’
The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie; there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray, according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie.

Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand, and alarm the house with his cries.
“You did not see her?
The abbé replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same.
The queen walked first, every one followed her.
“I rave?” said Morrel; “well, then, I appeal to M. d’Avrigny himself.
“Here I am, your excellency,” said Peppino, with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to him.
Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father’s love.
We will not constrain you to help us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel you to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.”
“It was worn by my father, a loyal gentleman.
“And how do you know it?” asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.
“I have one, the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London; but since you tell me to whom it is addressed, ’tis useless to wait till then.”
“I will descend with my eyes shut.”
Valentine?”
Thomson & French?” inquired the stranger.
“Well,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “I am delighted that De Rochefort is free, but as for thee, if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king’s servants they will hang thee without mercy.
A shot was fired that moment; Mousqueton shrieked with pain.
“Besides,” said she, “the sum you required me to borrow was rather large.”
“I have just had the pleasure,” replied the count; “but I have not seen your father.”
“It is useless,” replied Henrietta, “the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no.
“Where you please, my dear child.”
The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display, looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy—the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles.
Mousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton.
“No.”
“Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.”
People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world.
A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say, keeping his hand in.
However, he continued all the same, but with increasing warmth: “Yes, I can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me to be killed, my precautions are taken.
Poor Edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on his deathbed, to pardon his enemies.
“’Twas so, then—’twas so, then,” murmured the abbé.
He had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning.
“I cannot wait.”
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at nearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the morning, with its houses and towers.
“But,” said Franz to the count, “with this theory, which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law.
“On the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary.”
“How so?”
“Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!”
Possessed by one single thought—that of the promise he had made, and of the responsibility he had taken—he retired last to his chamber, begged the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different roads from Béthune to Armentières, and summoned the lackeys.
“Never!” said the queen, “never!”
A parliamentary officer, clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill, entered, bowed to the king, and unfolding a parchment, read the sentence, as is usually done to criminals before their execution.

He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country; some contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote their blood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause.
I fix on Boulogne because I presume that every town in France is indifferent to you; if you prefer another, name it; but you can easily conceive that, surrounded as I am by influences I can only muzzle by discretion, I desire your presence in Paris to be unknown.”
Before this day closes, if M. Danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or I shall die.
He was yielding to your infernal influence; but I will save him.
“Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”
Sell the crown diamonds.
“Amen!” exclaimed D’Artagnan, stopping the carriage.
Certainly neither I nor Fernand,” said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner.
On the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues from the coast of England.
God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.”

His soldiers formed a legion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself.
“Was he liberated, then?”
As for Albert, he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him.
Albert reflected.
You know the rest.
“Ah, yes, so I was.
He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear, the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood.
Mademoiselle Danglars!” exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.
Are you too proud to accept it, young gentleman?”
“Is one friend forbidden to visit another, or a Musketeer of my company to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart’s company?”
“Do you wish for a proof?”
The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, “I have a wife who is seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty.
woe is me!” cried the lieutenant; “there’s only one man in the world who could stay my hand; by a fatality that very man bars my way.
See him, and hear what he says.”
Château-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of the other.”
In fifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends.
“You knew him?
“Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.”

Then they were both silent.
“So much the worse,” said Valentine, smiling.
So much the better, Duke, so much the better,” said the king, advancing toward the door.
“Where are we to go?” asked Porthos.
Why should not the king of France have the same chance as the emperor?”
I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound, and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion, too, that death would follow.”
“The king,” muttered the wounded man, “the king is a prisoner.”
“Then I paid the host six.”
I made them, but you know, my dear friend, Madame du Vallon——”
“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And Albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at her.
D’Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote, or rather corrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his fingers.
“A Nubian?”
I shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms!
“Well, then, come here, my dear,” said D’Artagnan, establishing himself in an easy chair; “come, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest _soubrette_ I ever saw!”
“Very well, sir,” said Comminges, “you shall hear of this anon.”
“He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not even find his father’s grave.”
“What!
“The minister’s wife, _pardieu!_”
In the midst of this chamber were four stones, which had formerly served as an altar, as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them.
Since my convalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am forced to regulate them a little.
“I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect, on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South.”
“I should think so,—a horse that cost 5,000 francs!” said Monte Cristo, in the tone which a father would use towards a son.
The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter.
“You have forgotten then?”
“Down with the officer!
“Yes,” said the duke, smiling, “and I even believe that I know that other person; it is—”
Does not his appearance speak for him?
“Well?”
“The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious.”
“About my height; thin, pale, with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair.”
Milady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.
“Well, then,” replied the major, “they paid me 50,000 francs down.”
“This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to marry her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.”
“Die?
“Good Lord, how cold I am!” cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost sight of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern, and knocked at the door.
We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend’s chateau and there we have come to an understanding.
“In the hands of the devil, you mean!” cried Buckingham, raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely shouting.
The Return.
“That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either.
“No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall say, ‘Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence, watch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.’”
“There is half-past ten striking, Albert.”
“Who has been here?
“In a pate, for example.”
“It must be worth one’s while to stoop, Andrea, when that good M. Monte Cristo lets fall his purse.”
“You have been free to choose your career,” observed the Count of Morcerf, with a sigh; “and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers.”
The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded.
“Dear Wife,—We have now reached the moment of decision.
“So,” cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation, “you, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you ask but one thing—and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed, by my death!”
“Infamous!” said Mme.
“Already up, Raoul?” exclaimed the count.
Do not let us despond, but wait at Rueil, for my conviction is that they are at Rueil.
And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to walk alone here in the garden.
“I am giving them the slip,” said Eugénie; “this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our direction.”
“Backhanded.”
“Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the commissary, looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts, “you have a wife?”
The next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin.
“I am for no one.”
Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the boy.

“That is reasonable, since he is an only son.”
And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared in the darkness and took the road to Paris.
“_Pardieu!_ to transport me for life, how merciful!”
Coquenard filled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks.
“Perhaps.”
“Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?”
“Mademoiselle Valentine.” D’Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand.
“Why,” replied Porthos, “Mouston, of course.”
“What is his name?”
“Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea that it was so much.”
On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so far as to say, ‘Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you will never see me again.’”
It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle.
“Are you a large party?”
Patrick, let no one enter.
Who occupies Number 3?”
“Nonsense!
‘Vasiliki,’ said he to my mother, trembling perceptibly, ‘the instant approaches which will decide everything.
The executioner walked behind them, and Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis walked behind the executioner.
D’Artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise.
I broke my word, it is true; but what signifies that?
“And you of me, sir,” said Louvieres; “and we shall see then who can speak the loudest.”
“I will not fail.”
“And you know who she is?”
If there are three, let yourself be slain, but save the king.”
“Yes.”
Do you, Aramis, order the servants.
The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left, and seeing that it was empty, she said:
It was thus worded:
“To do what?
The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion, gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.
Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though well-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.
At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière.
Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard.
“Monsieur le comte, monsieur le chevalier, if ever I am king——”

Therefore let us separate.
Who was the invisible chief?
“Go to!
At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “He is not here!” But venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching with increased attention.
I forget.
“I see them about twenty paces behind my lord.
“For you,” he said.
She would have questioned him as he passed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed:
“You wish me, then, to relate the history of my past sorrows?” said she.
“When does M. d’Épinay return?”
Villefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes, and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.
“My dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories, it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning.
“How so?” said Andrea.
“You have guessed it,” answered Aramis; and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything; he thought they were fighting.
“Yes, you are right,” replied Villefort, surprised; “he sleeps, indeed!
As she uttered that bon mot, she arose and asked for her carriage.
“Will your excellency deign to open it?” said the delighted Bertuccio, “and you will find gloves in it.”

“Then did you see him, Edmond?”
All fell to their knees.
it is his voice!”
I may sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?” added Monte Cristo.
But tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining unmarried?”
“Listen,” said he; “just now I told you it was of M. de Monte Cristo you must demand an explanation.”
“Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?”
All night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his way.
You are dressed; it is now my turn to dress myself.’
“I?
“Sir,” answered a voice from the depths of the earth.
He saw a little dark man, ill made and awkward with his hands in everything—except drawing a sword and firing a pistol—with something haughty and contemptuous in his face.
Well, while taking my walk I will call on him and we will talk.
“Condescend to listen to me, and you shall know all.”
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger, the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, “it is false; he has just written to me!”
D’Artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger.”
“Well!” resumed Mme.
“Have you it?” asked Raoul
“But if they are numerous,” observed Mousqueton, “’tis not we who have them, but they who have us.”

“I have not that honor, monseigneur,” replied the latter, his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which D’Artagnan traveled.
“No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said Madame de Villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M. de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies.”
“What are you about?” said D’Artagnan.
“I, too,” cried Mousqueton, “saw them also.”
“Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with you?
“Then you suffer a great deal?”
“What is that?” asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was not willing to understand.
Athos took the letter from the hands of D’Artagnan, approached the lamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder.
He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, “My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions.
“I will do better than that,” said Albert; “my mother is wishing to go to the sea-side—what day is fixed for your dinner?”
“At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness, in case your excellency should fail.”
“Ever since there were prisoners in it,” answered Comminges.
“Yes,” said Madame de Villefort, “the door was towards the road before, and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road, I remember.”
But the Revolution of July was, it seems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period.
Bazin, my friend, come here.”
D’Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence.
When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced; when M. de Tréville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade—he stopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, “Do you know what the king said to me,” cried he, “and that no longer ago than yesterday evening—do you know, gentlemen?”
You will take your place in the _coupé_ to Châlons.
“What, not asleep!” said Felton; “what is she doing, then?”
“And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,” added Caderousse.
Maximilian uttered a cry of delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss.
“What ails you, my lord?
do you not know him?”
“Nothing easier,” said Peppino.
“But in order to go to London,” added Porthos, “money is needed, and I have none.”
“Why, here is the simple fact.
Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you not to persuade them to stay.”
Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.
“I will continue, then,” resumed Aramis.
“Only that?
That’s where we are.
But he has wealth, I believe, already.”
“What can be done with four?”
“And besides,” said the countess, “accustomed as he is to burning climates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.”
“But let us go,” continued De Winter; “let us be off; the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor—do you see it there?
The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice.
Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight.”
A Nightly Patrol.
“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the alarm gun,” replied Dantès.
But, dear friend, if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to you.” Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades.
“I shall pass all my life,” thought D’Artagnan, “in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot.”
Mme.
I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king.”
“I am not only the most miserable of queens, but the most unhappy of mothers, the most wretched of wives.
It is enough.
Chapter 97.
she was poisoned on my account.”
Is it not so?”
Everything was as we have said, a question of arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.
“Well!” replied La Ramee, “your supper is ordered.”
“Ah, monseigneur.”
The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him.
A second scream, more piercing than the first, now sounded.
oh, my king!—and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people.”
How could I help being astonished when, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you face to face—you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he loves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I had seen you!
“Oh, sir!” exclaimed he, “thank Heaven I have arrived in time.
But Pistache, as at first, turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane.
Athos was more delighted than can be told.
“Did you observe, D’Artagnan, that three days running they have brought us braised mutton?”
The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and contained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding.
The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his _coupé_ did not appear.
One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to D’Artagnan’s deliberations; this was the name of Madame de Longueville.
Milady raised her head, saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.
“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”
“Talking of countries,” replied Franz, “of what country is the count, what is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune, and what were those events of his early life—a life as marvellous as unknown—that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy?
Now, Monsieur de Vallon,” said Mazarin, “what service do you prefer, in the town or in the country?”
If you were to die, I should die too.”
Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly fashioned, and worthy of its mistress.
“Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?”
“No.
“Oh, we can scarcely say.
The outlook was sad.
He was compelled, then, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. D’Artagnan, be it remembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the saddest hearts.
But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.”
“And the goldsmith?”
He had entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants.
“Sire,” said Athos, “we foresaw this; and if Lord Winter’s men but do their duty, we are saved, instead of lost.”
“Has got off without any accident.
“Yes.”
“To be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters,” said Aramis.
“Monsieur le comte,” said the duchess, giving him a letter, “here is what I promised you; our young friend will be extremely well received.”
Well, I can weather the storm—I, whom, notwithstanding, you tax with fear—not with bravado, that is not my way; but I am firm.
“You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow upon it, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body.
Listen, then.”
“Certainly.
THE ANJOU WINE Chapter XLIII.
“You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet.”
Take a cigar.”
“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!”
“You?
The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into the abyss.
“In Artois, where I fought for years.
Chapter XXXV.
The most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly D’Artagnan, although he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily equipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but our Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and almost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction) so vain as almost to rival Porthos.
“Take all, then—take all, I tell you, and kill me!”
“Oh, sir!” Planchet only touched the tips of the count’s fingers.
“Odds fish!
“I do.”
“Guilty?
A man has carried off your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your brain, and despair in your heart.
His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed his forehead.
I carried the infection of crime with me, and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever, the cholera, the plague!
“You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?”
“To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine.”

Zounds!
“Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?”

And they separated with courteous gestures.
“Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,” she said; “they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.”
Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton, that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another, he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared.
“Yes; the conditions will be better than afterward.”
Franz smiled; an instant after the count entered.
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer.
“Yes, and important.
“There are special reports on every prisoner.”
You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return you the like, and not to fail.”
“Ah, it is No, then?”
Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box; so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other would still have hers left.
“And whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,” said Kitty, “you will find me loving you as I love you today.”
“But I am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed.”
“My poor mother!” said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, “I know she would; but better so than die of shame.”
“I will denounce him!” exclaimed the young man hastily.
Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and the old servant of whom we have already spoken.
Shall I leave you?
He is an upstart, a man of no name, who will only be the tool of a party in France.
“To congratulate me—what for?”
He was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under arms.
I say, why is the king taken prisoner?
“Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a case; my selfishness will blind me,” replied Morrel, whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation.
D’Artagnan, whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies, swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy.
A gesture, a smile and a word from Grimaud, all at once, were so unusual that his highness stopped short, astounded.
Should anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but do not breathe a word of this letter.”
“_Ma foi_, spread that idea,” replied the Count of Monte Cristo, putting his foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage, “and that will be worth something to me among the ladies.”
Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited the event.
“Some lackey,” murmured D’Artagnan.
“Well?”
1.E.4.
“They are bad managers,” said D’Artagnan, shrugging his shoulders.
“Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that I ordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one—and now the mystery is solved.”
“Oh, Valentine!”
“Tell us what,” returned D’Artagnan, “but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains.”
Athos never received any letters; Athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know.
“Finally,” said Felton, “finally, what did they do?”
“She loves him devilishly,” he murmured.
As to my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; I have them.”
“Oh, sir, twenty-five years.”
“Good heaven!
“‘Here they are,’ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon the table 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.
Why, that is a fortune!”
But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the banker’s daughter, though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company.
Besides, as M. de Tréville saw the queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.
“While fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he took out the key, and barricaded himself inside.
“Ah, ah!
The young man’s eyes kindled in secret, but he restrained himself.
On entering the court of his hôtel, Buckingham sprang from his horse, and without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his neck, and sprang toward the vestibule.
Since my misfortunes I have been subject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have just felt a cold shiver.
D’Artagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris.
“You have suspicions, nevertheless?”
The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked black and deep.
Many a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself.
The queen remained silent.
“Sir, you are tempting me?”
As D’Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, “My faith!
The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking with a strong Italian accent, “You are, I presume, M. Caderousse?”
Are you not well?”
“No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I left my office.”
Take a post-chaise or a carriage.”
“I swear,” she said, “by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my lover.”
It was her first, and on what an occasion!
I have corrected the vices that I had; I have assumed the virtues that I had not.
“Then——” pursued the young man eagerly.
“A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place.”
Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible.”
I think these fellows will never come.”
“Ah!
The doctor went out first, followed by M. de Villefort.
An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the remains of a hat between his hands.
His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons.
“Would you like to have a physician called?” said the woman.
“Take one step more,” said I, “and in addition to my dishonor, you shall have my death to reproach yourself with.”
“What have you to offer to me, my friend?
“He will sully it then,” returned Lucien; “for I am low—very low.”
The next morning, when Kitty presented herself at D’Artagnan’s, she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the contrary sad as death.
“Never mind; let us go on.”
This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord, for which I should never console myself.
Yes, sir.”
“Sire,” continued M. de Blacas, “if it only be to reassure a faithful servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné, trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces?”
“Any way, mother.”
“The young man is here,” said the valet de chambre in the same tone.
Charles, who is my prisoner, may still have friends, but I have none!”
You’ll excuse me, I know.”
Lack-a-day!
D’Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and he felt inclined to return.
“Bah!” said D’Artagnan, “they will have left a chicken, at least.” He dismounted and knocked on the door.
When I am insulted I do not faint; I avenge myself!”
The count fancied that he was yielding, and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the Château d’If.
Has he built one here, then?”
Yet he did not return home.
“‘On his murderers.’
“‘How,’ do you ask?
One of them lifted the plank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his companion.
The post-chaise——”
One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without touching the money?
“You have suffered a great deal, sir?” said Franz inquiringly.
Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words.
“No, sir, they were carried off instantly, and had not even time to tell me why; but as soon as they were gone I found this broken sword-blade, as I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones.”
“By whom are you charged?”
“Yes, we are devoted to them,” repeated Porthos; “and you—to whom are you devoted now?”
“And so, Aramis, you are decidedly going into the Church?
“Well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt.”
When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante-chamber.
And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.
Andrea assumed his gayest manner.
The next morning, on awaking, Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance.
“—of intrigues and secrets of state,” continued D’Artagnan, complying with the recommendation.
“I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred.
“Bah!” said Athos.
D’Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.
It wounded the pride of the parliament, which, supported by the citizens, replied by declaring that Cardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent; denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state, and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from France within a week afterward; enjoining, in case of disobedience on his part, all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him.
They never overtook the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are green, the inquiries increased at every step.
“Mordaunt,” replied Grimaud.

This excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost.
Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent.
Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage, from which he made the people inside dismount, and brought them to the vehicle which had upset.
“Really?
“Yes and no,” replied Mousqueton.
She will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies!
Speak!”
Among them was one of a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance.
On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall:
Morcerf smiled.
“Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences.”
The president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the clever and implacable pen of Villefort.
In fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman; and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock.

“Yes,” said Valentine; “besides, it will not be for long.”
On his side D’Artagnan became more cautious also.
Chapter XXV.
Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration; for that which almost proved that he was the son of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension; he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows, thin lips, hooked nose, and prominent cheek-bones of Grimaud were favorable signs.
On a table in the next room were lighted candles, cards, two dice-boxes, and dice.
“You cannot take me with you?”
“I repeat it, you must really be a very strange and superior man, for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited, that when I am with her she speaks of no one else.”
At length, M. de Tréville himself returned.
The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends.
“Had treated with the Seraskier15 Kourchid, who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that Ali Tepelini—after having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom he reposed great confidence—resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself, and which he called _kataphygion_, or the refuge.”
Why did you talk of a regiment, Athos?
“And the matter seems serious to you?”
And who?”
It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend, or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain, or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant’s visit.
Was there nothing to fear?
“Of what kind, in the name of wonder?”
“Swear what?”
“It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.”
“Certainly,” said Morrel, “I am at your service, count; still——”

“I will show you the way back myself,” said the captain; “that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency.”
Whilst he thus hesitated the host re-entered the room, followed not only by a surgeon, but by many other persons, whom curiosity had attracted to the spot.
His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget it ever can be bitter to others.
If you die, I will die with you; that is all I can say to you.”
“On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.”
“My dear count,” said Morcerf, “I beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely.”
In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.
In what am I benefited by accompanying my son so far, since I now abandon him, and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of Africa?
“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place in the church of Accoules.”
It was intensely dark; still Ali, thanks to his wild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement, could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees.
“Most decidedly,” said he, “men are not equal, and I must beg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.”
“What was it that you thought?” asked the young man anxiously, in his turn descending from the table.
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow.
“Ah, monsieur!” said she, “you have saved me; permit me to thank you.”
The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air.
However, this is much, and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.”
Renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover.
The curate then entered, followed by Planchet.
“Oh, well, I don’t know; but I understand that she is going to Italy.
“The king himself.”
“Oho!” said Porthos, his eyes glistening at the news.
Chapter 103.
“Look,” said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard, “here is in this cup some syrup of violets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook.
Milady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.
“Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends.”
Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written these words—‘From Lord Ruthven to Countess G——.’”
The lackey bowed and let them pass.
They have vexed you, and you are angry?”
It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man’s favor.
“Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been deputy procureur.
“Stop,” said he; “I will go with you.”
“Kitty,” said he, “I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like; don’t let that disturb you.” And he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry.
And the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash into the ditch.
“I am (as you have said) the Count Andrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence.

“Ah, his friend is with him?” said Raoul.
thou hast prospered and grown stout!” and D’Artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one.
“And Beppo led him outside the walls?” said the count.
“Yes, indeed.
“Are you sure that we are not its objects?”
The major’s eyes sparkled brilliantly.
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him.
“Mercédès!” repeated Monte Cristo; “Mercédès!
The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire.
The young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again, rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and rosemary—for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before.
“I shall return thither, my lord, but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me.”
Athos counseled D’Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.
Alight, Planchet, and inquire, for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to do.”
“It matters little.
Mazarin, as a statesman, will understand the politic necessity.”
The Ball Chapter 71.
“I am wholly a stranger to Paris—it is a city I have never yet seen.”
“Hum!” said D’Artagnan.
He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased.
The old man recognized his child, and Carlini recognized the old man.
And Athos confessed to himself that, he was unprepared for so prompt a departure; but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian.
“An opportunity will come,” replied Rochefort.
“Because, while you were talking with him, I watched you without listening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or three times!”
You evidently know her.
After the most disheartening news of the king’s health, a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward.

“Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend.
Have you the diamond?” continued Athos.
Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after him, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his light hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume the black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo.
Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos; and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain.
“All this looks suspicious.”
He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check.
He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed.
The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.
“But how to take them, sire?
Today is the 29th of August; the 21st of September will, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that time arrives—and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give you—till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other.”
“I will stop at the first posting-house,” said Danglars to himself.
“Yes, pray, accursed woman!” cried the baron; “your prayer is so much the more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a man who will never pardon you!” and he went out.
Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.
“I will compensate thee for the loss of thy place.”
Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating.
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church!
It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminence’s Guardsmen had received.
“I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes, passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house, in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship.”
At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornélie, her confidential maid.
Faria followed him with an excited look.
It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king.
“My friend,” D’Artagnan interrupted, “as I don’t understand English and we all understand Spanish, have the kindness to speak to us in that language, which, since it is your own, you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance.”
Milady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door.
“Bravo,” cried Château-Renaud; “you are the first man I ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism.
“Come my brother, go with me,” added D’Artagnan, “and I will see that you are made a duke!”
“He appears cool.
Thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took part with the king’s Musketeers in these quarrels.
Chapter 111.
When he saw his employer, the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed, drew on one side into the corner of the landing-place, passed his quid from one cheek to the other, stared stupidly with his great eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return.
As for Aramis, he went off to the bishop’s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the king’s presence.
As to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as we have said, in a very bad state.
Do you say that M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry M. le Baron Franz d’Épinay?”
Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage.
The abbé saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,—“No one; but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an eye-witness.”
“Yes, that first, and other things afterward.”
“Never!
“One only needs to be sharp, that’s all.

“Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.”
Felton did not enter.
Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf.
In truth, that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man.”
“That’s not needed.
M. de Villefort entered his father’s room, followed by Madame de Villefort.
“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought?
“The devil!
Tell me what it says.”
Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure you!”
Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say:
Louis XIII.
“No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race.
“Very well, my dear sir, you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman.”
“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”
“Speak to the governor, then.”
He took the opportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the musketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the quays, and on the Pont Neuf.
Now, will you taste our wine, and without prejudice say what you think of it?”
“It is miserable—do you see?—always to wait till the end of the month.”
Baron, send for the minister of war.
They then embraced each other like two brothers, and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds, flowers and infants.
“Don’t be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure.”
Caderousse’s knife, dark lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was conveyed to the morgue.
But too late by a minute, unfortunate, unfortunate that I am!”
“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator.”
“’Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby.”
“He sets sail tomorrow!
“In Italy?”
I have come, therefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.”
At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity.
“Me?” said the young girl, “he never even glances at me; on the contrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid me.
Faria smiled.
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined for some days; but I accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou wine, with which they are much pleased.
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, “you are insupportable.
D’Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:
You marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter?
“Ah!” said D’Artagnan to himself, “can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds?
“Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!”

“Arrived in London, you will seek Buckingham.”
Except the knowledge of blazons, that enables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry—I, a count of a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery of St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been told that when you travel much it is necessary.
“To me?”
“Still?—Always!
my lord the cardinal!”
D’Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos’s last remark he stopped short.
The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them.
“Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!”
“The only chance for Albert’s safety, then, will arise from your emotion.”
Groslow jumped in, followed by Mordaunt, and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London; and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs.

I have heard here and there that this sister-in-law was a hussy.
Come, let us come to the point.
“Then,” continued the host, “I replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, I hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but Monsieur Porthos replied that, my house being the best, he should remain where he was.
On seeing this figure, mute and immovable as a statue, Milady was frightened.
“Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself, madame, or this charming little merry boy.
Felton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body.
“Oh, _mon Dieu!_” said Monte Cristo, “and I have forgotten my smelling-bottle!”
“Your name?”
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough.
“Pray take notice,” said the countess, “that my present residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening.
But by what means?
There, caressing as he pretended, the animal with his hand, he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear.
I have sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all.
He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial.
“Read the address.”
There remained, then, no other place to fear but the Traitor’s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road to it.
“The same, perhaps,” said he.
“Do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud.
“Well!” said Aramis.
“This doctor has a niece,” continued Aramis.
Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d’Armilly’s fingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio’s malediction on Desdemona.
Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead.
“Ah!” exclaimed the king, “to fight?”
“You are right,” said Monte Cristo; “and I have none.” These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder.
“With your brother?”
Such news was decisive; it destroyed, in favor of the court, the struggle commenced with parliament.
And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meilhan was obtained.
“Well, sir,” said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully, “may I hope?”
There were no questions.
Louis XIII.
“Why so?
D’Artagnan was looking at Athos, whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king, possessing more self-control, had banished from his own.
“Is it possible you were so kind?”
“I will give it to none but the king, monsieur,” said Anne.
“Why do you do so?”
At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him, approached; it was M. Morrel.
Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himself—an intervention which had saved them from despair.
Say when shall it be?
“What is your name, my friend?” she said.
“Well,” said the baron, on leaving her “you will not escape tonight!”
“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial.
“But,” said Mordaunt, looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes, “these are Frenchmen, I imagine.”
They called upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer at heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would remain with Messieurs the Musketeers.”
Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper, Beauchamp—as it sometimes, we may say often, happens—was his intimate friend.
If you refuse this right you may kill me, but I shall not fight.”
He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of Milady.
Villefort took a chair, but Valentine remained standing by her father’s side, and Franz before him, holding the mysterious paper in his hand.
We have served them to the best of our poor means, and God will recompense the will, forgive the want of power.
“How, monsieur?” cried Bazin, “a poem sell so dear as that!
But one of these balls, launched by Porthos’ herculean hand, passed so close to D’Artagnan’s face that he thought that if, instead of passing near, it had hit him, his audience would have been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king.
Edmond Dantès.
“Is it not almost incredible,” said Madame Danglars, “that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command, should possess so little information?”
“You will speak in Italian,” said he.
“And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?”
“What is his name?”
“Say on.”
The prisoner did not understand, or seemed not to understand, what Raoul said to him; and Raoul could hardly understand his replies, containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsatian.
“What do I see?” cried the lieutenant.
Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening.
I assure you that, as long as I live, I shall never love anyone else!”
You know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty.”
“The more so, as it will be the prelude to a better.”
“The deuce!—and what is this condition?”
“I will come myself.”
“What sort of a man is he?”
“Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?”
“I am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he has given me, and I promise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses—”
“An hour after sunset.”
But listen to me—listen—and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal, without casting the least portion upon you.”
When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadjutor.
I am obliged to you Guitant, although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me, for such an opportunity.”
“Which are your windows?” asked he of the count, with as much indifference as he could assume.
“Shut up, there!” cried the pit in chorus.
“Some full, others empty.”
“Dear grandfather.” said she hurriedly, “you know poor grandmamma died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.”
“Do you hear, baron?
They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a triumphal march.
Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came into Milady’s apartment before nine o’clock, and it would require three hours to go from the castle to London.
“Then you must come up into my room.”
If you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain.
Leave me, then, to act, and have no fears for the result.”
“Do you believe in apparitions?” asked Athos of Porthos.
He did not then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness, one cannot incline one’s self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI.
Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination.
As he spoke, Dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked, and started.
“And your two other friends?” he asked.
Oh, no self-love, Beauchamp.
“So, my dear Bazin!” said the officer, laughing, “this is the way you receive an old friend.”
He was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows, the memory of his father, Henry IV.
“Faith, no, thank Heaven!” replied Raoul; “but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering?”
The fool!
“When she chose.
“No, monsieur,” returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea.
“I was chosen.
“Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.”
They all set off, swift as the wind.
I say your troops, for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs?”
But I am not selfish, and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter.
“You discovered what had become of your mother?”
“The ground is soaking wet; yet I fancy, as thou sayest, that I see something.”
All four once more together.
“But methinks I need wine!” and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an ordinary glass.
“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”
[7] Dr. Guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in Italy.
On her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously.
“This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and his father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.”
“I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night—the night of the 20th of September—a child had been brought there, wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half.
The door at last opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears were vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count exclaimed: ‘Ah, here is the Baron Franz d’Épinay!’ I summoned all my strength and courage to my support.
“I—did I promise you anything, my lord?”
“See what good fortune I brought you!” said Morrel, when he was alone with the count.
“He did; saying at the same time, ‘You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.’”
“His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000 francs for his horses?”
“Hold your tongue, imprudent man!
“Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet.”
Let us separate, and let us seek the mercer’s wife—that is the key of the intrigue.”
Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf’s, when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort.
Lead two sheep to the butcher’s, two oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his companion will not die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy.
“Well, sirs!” cried the queen, on perceiving the two friends, “you have come, faithful friends!
“Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer, as we did in straw,” said Porthos.
Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”
I shall work, doctor—when I work I forget everything.”
It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one’s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.”
The queen and her minister, more especially the latter, had reason to feel anxious.
This was all that M. de Tréville wanted.
At that moment D’Artagnan opened his eyes.
D’Artagnan found his advice prudent.
Jackson,” said he, “go instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell him that I charge him with the execution of these orders.
“What is the meaning of that noise?”
Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.”
“We will say no more about it, then.
Bazin was making, with his spare little short arms, ridiculous gestures.
Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm-chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand.
“You see,” said Athos.
The Bell and Bottle Tavern Chapter 99.
Raoul, learn how to distinguish the king from royalty; the king is but a man; royalty is the gift of God.
“Return, then, at five o’clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you.
The author of this history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries.
If he proves himself worthy of it, I will do what I can to advance his interests.
(D’Artagnan turned to Porthos.
What have you done with her, then, if you have her no longer?”
“The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.”
He recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard.

“You know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in Italy?” (This is the name of the lower class.)
Madame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment, and from astonishment to stupefaction.
Julie made a pretence to feel for the key.
It is done,” cried she, wiping away her tears, and resuming her firmness, “I am resolved not to die of remorse, but rather of shame.

When one is eating, ideas flow easily.
He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends.
30203m
His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.
“Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy—a storm which menaces no less than your majesty’s throne.
Yes, here it is.”
In the first place you have plenty of money, haven’t you?
fire, then!” when the shot was fired.
“Oh, no, no,” said the general, smiling faintly, “I did not come for that purpose; you are right.
“‘Thanks,’ replied the jeweller.
“And Dauphiné, sir?” inquired the king, of Villefort.
The crime was depicted in the most vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur.
“And I _idem_,” said Aramis.
At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal.
“Where do you come from?”
It is God’s pleasure that things should be so.”
More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.
“Come on, then,” said Athos, “for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go.”
“To meddle in politics,” he exclaimed, in a languid voice, leaning back in his easy-chair.
“Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.
Do you want anything?”
“Yes, monsieur.” Villefort opened a large register, then went to a table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to Morrel,
I know the French as well as if I had made them myself.
“And you have seen him?”
How is it that we, four men who have faced armies without blinking, begin to tremble at the mention of a child?”
“He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,” said Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie’s voice; “but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.”
He answered therefore:
“Go, then, my friends,” said the former, sighing.
Come, there cannot be too many.”
“A moment,” said Athos; “with your permission, monsieur, I wish to speak a word with my friend.”
“Is Monsieur d’Artagnan there?”
“Mr.
Of course you stopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.
“Why not, sir?” asked Charles.
“Lord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges.
1.E.7.
On!
Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name?”
“Not the least in the world,” said Aramis and Athos at once.
“Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?”
Ask Baron Franz d’Épinay; I think he tasted them one day.”
“That is true; we should need clothes and arms.”
Believe me, you ought now to take a rest.
“From London.”
30111m
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Villette.
Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before the window.
D’Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.
“Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the less alarm my father and myself.”
Ah, believe me, Edmond, as I told you, I too have suffered much; I repeat, it is melancholy to pass one’s life without having one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that proves that all is not yet over.
The cousin was received with resignation, that was all.
“The horse?” said Morcerf, laughing.
The Indictment
Bernouin was waiting there, impatient for news of his master.
Edmond had all the night to work in, but in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited for day.
“Well, search, my friend, search; and when you have found, you will tell me, will you not?”
Then Caderousse, feeling that he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and with a dying voice cried with great effort:
So D’Artagnan began:
We make in our case a deposit, on a mortgage, which is an advance, as you see, since we gain at least ten, fifteen, twenty, or a hundred livres’ worth of iron in exchange for our money.
If he could have made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in Paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;—therefore he has gone, and I am free forever,” added Madame Danglars, in the same supplicating tone.
“I do not understand you, baron,” said Morcerf.
Raoul, his hat in ribbons, his face bleeding, felt not only his strength but also his reason going; a red mist covered his sight, and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him, ready to seize upon him when he fell.
It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot, but a concerted organized attack.
Bonacieux.
“I mean a young man whom you patronize, Monsieur de Tréville.”
“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons.
All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house.
These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept.
“All?”
The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other.
They entered.
“You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon_.”
“But you said that your name was D’Artagnan.”
“Sire,” said Aramis, “will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this?”
There is no word, though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart, that can express my gratitude.
At his house rebellion could be planned with impunity, for, as we have said, since that morning he had ceased to be “the queen’s invalid.”
I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds; I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood; on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who were in danger, and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took away.
Left alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which he secured with his special seal.
“I will not abandon Buckingham thus.
“I come from the cardinal,” said the officer.
Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?”
“Who are those gentlemen?” asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.
“The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.”
“Here we are,” said Monte Cristo; “it is only half-past ten o’clock, come in.”

“Bridle in mouth!” said D’Artagnan.
“Well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content yourselves with that.”
“Yes, yes, madame, you must; and I will save them all.”
Athos smiled, and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear.
The opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him to remain solvent.
Morrel looked at her with astonishment.
“What do the people want this time?” demanded the king.
“That is but poor encouragement.”
Athos as a Diplomatist.
“Very good, father-in-law,” said Cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born nature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it.
The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with Maximilian and Emmanuel.
“You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it.” said D’Artagnan.
No, she must have conceived some pathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous.”
“By the gentleman who was here yesterday.
The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore, but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache.
The servant entered just as he had finished.
They entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast anchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed, approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder.
murder!
“Did he reflect before he insulted my father?”
Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality.
“Will you not come with me?” he said; “I shall pass by Blois.”
“When he is absent I am there.”

“It is not courage that is needed; it is prudence.”
His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him, he replied that the abbé was not in Paris, an answer which satisfied most persons, because the abbé was known to be a great traveller.
“I was thinking, my dear old friend, that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church, and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer.”

“Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,” observed D’Artagnan, “until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise; some place it on Mount Ararat, others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates; it seems that they have been looking very far away for it, while it was actually very near.
“It is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms.”

“I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that—listen to me attentively—if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you, and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison—a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed Valentine.”
I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand livres.”
The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt:

“Farewell,” said Charles, “farewell, my children.
“I forgot to mention to you,” said the count, “that I lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my death.
“Father,” said the young man, “I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo, the generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you.”

S.—Go to the king’s treasurer, at Blois; tell him your name and show him this letter; you will receive two hundred pistoles.”

“‘Yes,’ said Caderousse.
“He need not sail!” cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of mind.
About half a mile from this, on the same road, there is an inn, and about a mile further on, after leaving the inn, you will reach the village of Greney.
Very well.
We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or ten.”
“No, I do not understand; what do you mean?” stammered the unhappy woman, completely overwhelmed.

D’Artagnan, keeping at some distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.
And the name of this lord?”
The baroness ascended the steps; she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrate’s study.

Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin, made a pompous eulogium on his candidate.
“Come near to us from time to time, as if to speak; but do not speak, and do not listen.
“The plan is his own.”
And the Musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast.
You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs.

Six days!
“And you, Porthos,” continued the count, as if in consideration for D’Artagnan’s embarrassment, “you, the best heart, the best friend, the best soldier that I know—you, with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne, and who, sooner or later, must receive your reward from an intelligent king—you, my dear Porthos, you, a gentleman in manners, in tastes and in courage, you are as culpable as D’Artagnan.”
I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the ground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a laburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a resting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand, relaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone.

Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return of the _Pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived in harbor.
You are questioning me like a king’s attorney.
D’Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same.
The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine’s _“I am coming”_ was the customary signal of farewell.
“Alas!

They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying.

“Ah, my God!” whispered Mme.
“Well,” said she, returning the knife to the young officer, “this is fine and good steel.
“Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,” returned Albert; “you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us.”

“Sir,” returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, “make your mind easy on this score.

Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.
Is that your opinion, D’Herblay?”
“May I also be allowed,” said Morcerf, “to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars?”
“This philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence.

In a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked, and wrapped in a large red cloak.
At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written “Mirame, a Tragedy in Five Acts,” and raised his head.
“Porthos, men like us can’t go out from here purely and simply.”
M. de Tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline.
Silence and fatigue together overcame D’Artagnan and sleep overtook him also.
The country was beautiful, intersected by valleys as green as the emerald.
“So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?” replied the count with increased anxiety.
Albert kissed his mother’s hand, and drew near the count.
Had he remained with you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor would he have participated in your griefs.

The child put the piece of money into his pocket.
Athos went down and returned immediately.
“Oh, as to that, I shall take care, I assure you.
“Is it you?” she said.
“No matter; you know the word must; with that word great things are done.”
“No one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished.”

Yesterday’s affair must have shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite.”
“Faith,” said Aramis, laughing, “we have praised the dead enough, let us revile the living a little; I should like to say something evil of Mazarin; is it permissible?”

“Yes.”
Pretty, mysterious, initiated in almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love.

The twenty men marched straight toward the barrier, but from behind the beams, from among the wagon-wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time Planchet’s halberdiers appeared at the corner of the Cemetery of the Innocents, and Louvieres’s bourgeois at the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie.

D’Artagnan followed them.
Lend me your back—but don’t let the cardinal go.”

“Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.”
“You have seen him, then?”
“But could I do with a million?” retorted the count.
“I am still young, am I not?
Rochefort smiled contemptuously.

“I have none—nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have talked long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?”
Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vespers.”
And he extended his hands toward Grimaud, who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him.
On arriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use.
“Bravo!” thought D’Artagnan; “on this side I think the cardinal will be well guarded.” He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Athos.
“What?”
“Are you ill, mother?” cried the viscount, springing towards her.
I will describe my captivity.

Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore.
“Ah, monsieur le chevalier,” said Planchet, bowing.
D’Artagnan passed a very bad night.
“Why so?
“Ah, _diable!_ bells did you say?”
“Truly, my daughter,” replied he with a smile, “you are all you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell you which, but would rather leave you to guess it.”
“The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.”
Expiation
They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody.
“Is the deed of sale ready?”
Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers, who appeared to pity him.
Besides,” he said, “a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.”
At this moment the tumult was heard nearer.

“And I not at all,” said the prince, laughing.
I can discover and explain to you my grandfather’s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject.
You have done well to warn me.
A council was called on the same evening, but nothing transpired of what had been decided on.
“Have you any one to depend on for assistance?”
“What do you mean by tetragones?” asked D’Artagnan, uneasily.
“It is beautiful, is it not?” said D’Artagnan.
“Heaven preserve him!” said the queen.
“I would propose to you to stake Planchet, but as that has already been done, the Englishman would not, perhaps, be willing.”
“This very day.”
When the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.
“I am, then, your prisoner?”
This, reckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference of a million to Danglars.
“Nothing could be in better taste than my father’s demeanor, madame,” said Albert; “nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years.
“Then you permit me to go, you are not angry in your heart?” exclaimed Raoul, joyously.
Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—
“Ah,” cried Valentine suddenly, “I understand.
“And now, where are you going, viscount?” inquired De Guiche.
Villefort had secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections.

“We are then reconciled, dear Monsieur Porthos?” said she, simpering.
Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many others said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen him start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire if he had taken out a passport.
The count returned to a small drawing-room on the first floor, sat down, and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also.
Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside.
Ask day after to-morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle, and who is no other than Noirmont, your former maitre d’hotel.
Athos came down last, and found D’Artagnan already on horseback, and growing impatient.
The little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.
We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us.”
“Pray do so, I delight in stories,” cried the cardinal.
“How!
“I am lost,” murmured she; “I am lost!
“Stuff!” cried Porthos, almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit.
“For my misfortune.”
“Exactly; there are fifteen of them.”
“I can answer for it they do not.”
The young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut the door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned into the Rue des Fossés-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they came to the Place St. Sulpice.

“That is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which she was branded.”
His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had quarreled with the officers, disguised as stable lads—”
His drawing-room, under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained.
“Why all these precautions?”
Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort?”
“Useless!” said Athos, “useless!
The cardinal repressed another smile.
Two of the men from Jacopo’s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles.
“Anne de Bueil,” murmured the wounded man.
All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf.
“And what are they?”
“Alas!” said Madame de Chevreuse, with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own, “since that time everything has changed.”
Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence, without doubt, comes the proverb, “The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has.” Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor their battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished, which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.
Bazin appeared on the threshold, dull and spiritless.
I stepped into the shed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger.

“Come, sweep away all that for me!
“And where is that letter?”
Planchet, who had been the first to enter, was the last to leave.
But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile, that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes.
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos returned to the hôtel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.
It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant in itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.”
“He is beforehand with us,” said M. de Tréville.
Dantès had not been deceived—he had reached the first of the two islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen.
“From Athos!” cried D’Artagnan, recognizing the handwriting.
And the two young girls, whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief, the one on her own account, the other from interest in her friend, burst out laughing, as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape.
“Ask that woman,” said the man in the red cloak, “for you may plainly see she knows me!”
“There would be a very simple means, very natural—”
“And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?”
“Yes, just before you came.”
I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares.14 Besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my father, mother, Selim, and myself.
“So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off.
“If it is a snare,” replied D’Artagnan, “I shall scent it out, be assured.
“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of imprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow.
You will see the same at every opening from this palace to which I should lead you.

“With the Count of Morcerf,” answered Monte Cristo.
“I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed,” said Morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner.
“Oh, mon Dieu!”
“Enough?” asked M. de Tréville.
We have experienced the ingratitude of ‘the great,’ as you well know.”
The coadjutor bowed.
At this moment Ali entered.
“Yes; I hope so, at least.
“Explain yourself.” said Grimaud.
They passed the barrier without accident.
The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself.
The valet then left the room.
As to D’Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying.

Guides are useful people, who will turn their hands to anything.
Of these 600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns.

He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to him.
The cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others.
Then, calling Planchet, he said, “Now, my lad, you may claim your seven hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that.”
Aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.
The circumstances that had hastened the return of D’Artagnan to Paris were as follows:
“Sire, I listen,” said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.
Danglars shrugged his shoulders.
I would die willingly for the king, but supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin, as your nephew came near being to-day, there could be nothing in Paradise, however well placed I might be there, that could console me for it.”
It was there he must dig.
A Flurry in Stocks
“I foppish?
“Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician.

The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom Anne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to four persons—the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.
With this animal, which he called Pistache, he was often shut up for hours alone, superintending, as every one supposed, its education.
“I will give you three,” replied the stranger.
“Her preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was inquired after, but no one had seen him.
“Did you remark that man who is following us?”
I say two, because in such circumstances, Monsieur du Vallon, who is rich, always gives me his prisoners.”
“Well?”
“Yet,” replied Beauchamp haughtily, “there are occasions when probity commands——”
Then turning to Athos he added:
In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded, and then restraining their horses, they advanced cautiously.
A tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to the doctor.

Only I warn you, that when I reside in a country, I conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself within the compass of the French laws for your sake.”
But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Château d’If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery.

“Egad!” said D’Artagnan, “by Heaven!
I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.”
The coachman turning around, gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain.
“Just so.”
Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains.
“I prefer going, sir.”

Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables.

Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them.
“But, Monsieur Louvieres, are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me?”
Porthos, meantime, asked D’Artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey.
Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly, and set off.
“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my father and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus; and lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by the French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’ A greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence.

One by one the several groups broke up.
The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.
All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, many of the people used threatening language.
Nevertheless, you ought to remember that that great, that sublime monarch, when proscribed at one time, as my husband may be, demanded aid from England and England accorded it to him; and it is but just to say that Queen Elizabeth was not his niece.”

“On guard, then!” cried Athos.
“At what hour?” inquired a turnkey.
I read it a little while since.
“Undoubtedly,” said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos’s compliment; “as there is a diamond, let us sell it.”
“Where are you going?”
They descended the great staircase, taking with them all the guards they found on their road, and crying out, “To arms!

Porthos bowed, as if in assent.

“The jewel is yours, my dear Athos!
Mordaunt put his hand into the hat, took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it.
“What shall we do?”
He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous; nevertheless, the keen glance of Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them.

He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master.
Being no disciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of the scrape, I said, ‘Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers’ ends;’ whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you.”
“I will ask his servant.”
Bonacieux, “yes, there are traitors here; but by the holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I am.
“Come, come!” cried Rochefort.
GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
Planchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him succor; but it was plain that all assistance was useless—all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony.
“It will do,” replied the man, in a tremulous voice, “if you separate them across the neck.”
“I have heard talk of him.”
“I declare, my friend,” said he, “that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage.
The wretches were dancing.
“It appears so,” replied Monte Cristo.
“Embrace Porthos from Aramis and myself.
“Consoled for what?”
“Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and that what you call protection is more like an insult.”
A gentleman has but his word, and I have given you mine.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” motioned the invalid.
But young as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have powerful enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy you.”
A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre, and masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys, like two arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive from the iron gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a porcelain vase, filled with flowers.
Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.
“No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred.
“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.
“Well, I must confess, these are scruples.”
But what did M. Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?”
I know these lovers.
“Good-evening, sir,” answered the soldier, in a strong provincial accent.
“Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them again and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, ‘Count,’ said he, ‘you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care?’—‘Yes, sir,’ replied Morcerf; ‘but in that, like all the rest, misfortune pursued me.
I shall tell him, therefore, and in doing so I shall confer a personal favor on him, how he is mistaken in regard to me.
“Yes!
Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray.
She appeared to take a great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his friends, and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal.
really!” exclaimed Porthos, opening his great wondering eyes.
Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex.
“Do you know them, Fernand?” he said.
“And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his recital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you of my intentions?”
The name is wanting in this commission; you can write it yourself.”
My brother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore, be poor in comparison with me.
“I bring him to you, madame,” said Athos, withdrawing his hand, “hoping that in your turn you will do something for him; till now I have watched over his education and I have made him, I hope, an accomplished gentleman; but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction.
“Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.
We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe.
“Oh, my God, no!” said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature.
“Only Fernand?”
The four friends saw all this—not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them.
“What in the devil does he say?” asked the prince.
And perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile.”
Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she threw a bunch of violets.
M. D’ARTAGNAN, MM.
But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining here.” And he glanced timidly at the count’s blue coat.
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer.
“Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,” said the count, pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante; “your emotion has quite overcome you.”
“If my society would not be disagreeable.”
“I believe so.”
“There is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and Milady’s; every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other.”
D’Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to grow uneasy.
D’Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast.
is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?” cried Monte Cristo.
“What do I see?”
The count bowed again, but lower than before; he was even paler than Mercédès.
“Hem,” said Monte Cristo in his turn.
“Oh, yes,” said De Winter, “for they are the same men.
Edmond and Mercédès were clasped in each other’s arms.
“Ah, madame!” said Porthos, haughtily; “do you take me for a beggar?”
“Haydée?” said Morrel, “what has become of her?”
“Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?”
“Gentlemen,” said Jussac, “it is with great regret that I pronounce the thing impossible.
’Tis like a duel.
To imprison him, monseigneur?
“Madame,” said the chancellor, hesitating, “it would be to release Broussel.”
Give me my felt hat, Bernouin.”
The Rendezvous
“Yes.”
In proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing, was in reality a disgrace.
Ten minutes sufficed for their defeat, and D’Artagnan remained master of the field of battle.
“Explain yourself, my Lord,” replied the prisoner, with majesty; “for though I hear your words, I declare I do not understand them.”
They both looked searchingly at the young man, who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition.
The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.
“When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.” The friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise.
“Then you disapprove of duelling?
Their horses flew, and they never ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis.
The three men saluted one another, whilst exchanging a last look.
But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after the messenger’s departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly.
“I am glad they please you.”
27, Rue du Helder.”
He preserved this opinion even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master’s bed, the chimeras of Planchet faded away.
“I asked after you, and came up as soon as I could.”
I have nothing but memory.
“My God, yes, _gave_, that is the word,” said Porthos; “for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty.”
“Alas!
Although about forty-four or forty-five years old, she might have passed for thirty-five.
“‘Ah,’ said he—‘good, good!
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “your words sear and embitter my heart, the more so as you have every reason to hate me.
“You are a precious creature, my pretty hostess, and I am much obliged to you.”
Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him?
“We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses,” said D’Artagnan, “and share the three hundred.”
“Good!” he said, “nothing, almost nothing—scratches, nothing more; two in the arm and one in the breast.
“There is another word which pleases me,” cried Athos, with a gracious nod to D’Artagnan.
He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingarbe.
“Come, Aramis, now for the honor of France!” and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell, mortally wounded.
“I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount.
A young man does not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”
One of them took his gun by the barrel, and used it as he would a club.
But he had scarcely left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24 exclaimed:
this treasure will be lost.
“And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir,” said Morrel, “not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.”
“Yes; but who is to carry the letter to Tours, and who to London?”
Taste this cutlet, my dear D’Artagnan; ’tis off one of my sheep.”
“But if they say, ‘it must be’ to me, am I no longer king?”
They went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met Mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule and a horse.
“Speak not of crowns.
“Never,” said the Englishman.
He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom.
“Certainly I do.”
“What are your commands, lieutenant?”
This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor’s orchard, or the dried apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden.
“All this is very extraordinary,” said Château-Renaud; “still, what I admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed.
Athos took the letter, frowning, but an idea that he should find something in this letter about D’Artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it.
“Certainly—certainly,” cried Franz.
Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty:
As for Porthos, he looked inquiringly at D’Artagnan.
“True,” replied Franz.
Is there anything new in the wind?”
If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo——”
“No,” replied D’Artagnan; “what signifies a delay of half an hour?
I would lay a wager he has stolen it.”
He was still young—he was only four or five-and-twenty—he had nearly fifty years to live.
“Yes.”
The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della Robbia _faïences_, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV.
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.”
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head.
“You must go away immediately.
“I do not know of any grottos,” replied Jacopo.
Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I acknowledge.”
Take the hundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!”
“Promise me that, and I will die with that hope.”
“Dear friend, at Raoul’s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another, fancied or real.
“I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them.”
“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé.
D’Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what to think.
“Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.”
“I expected as much,” said Athos; “and that was why I threw myself between you and him.
“Let me see it,” said Milady.
“I knew that,” said Monte Cristo; “she has been dead these ten years.”
“I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.”
And what brought you here?”
“The devil!” said Athos; “here’s a rendezvous much more serious than the other.”
never fear,” said Aramis.
“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s head.”
Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it?—No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits the poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison.”
Is he living?”
“Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?”
Chapter XLVIII.
If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green.
“But, monsieur, it is very natural,” returned Bertuccio, “since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished.”
Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated.
This was an easy feat to him, for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port.
The prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust.
I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give you.”
“And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution?”
“Silence, silence!” cried the duke.
“Well, then, assume a cheerful manner, as I do; we must joke with the guards, we must gain the good-will of the soldiers, since we can’t corrupt them.
On this assurance the two friends fell asleep; and D’Artagnan, who was very weary, bade good-night to Grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak, with naked sword at his side, in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage, and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him.
“Of all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while it lasted, I have no remembrance.
And desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt.
Would to heaven!
The four or five remaining hours before nine o’clock arrived, Andrea employed in riding, paying visits,—designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker’s in their gayest equipages,—dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the initiative.
“And now,” said Morrel, “leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away.”
“Answer in your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience.”
At the other end, silent, scarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a sentinel, who was walking up and down before a grotto, which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere.

“Still,” said the governor, “I believe it will be requisite, notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead.”
“What weapons?”
“_To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp before La Rochelle_.
“For God’s sake, Porthos my friend, reserve your feats of strength, or they will not have, when needed, the honor they deserve.
But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages; his aim was to elude the examination.
“There is but one way left you that is safe,” said she; “it is through my grandfather’s room.” She rose.
“Ah!
He wished once again to press the count’s hand, but his own was immovable.
“I have asked the headsman of Bethune,” he said, his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief.
“Be easy,” said D’Artagnan, “he will know all before night.”
“Antoinette is very well,” he said, “and Madeleine tolerably so.
“No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I am young and wilful.
“Prince or not,” said the man, “open.
Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey.
Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess.
“Yes,” returned Morcerf, “a baron of a new creation.”
“Then we are upon the fugitives.”
The House at Auteuil
The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow and went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street mentioned.
“_Pardieu!_” replied D’Artagnan, “for my part, I am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables.”
“Good,” said Mazarin, “I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation.”
“Prevent me, then!” replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like the first, failed in releasing him from the count’s iron grasp.
“Ah!
“Wait here ten minutes,” said M. de Tréville; “and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out, return to my hôtel, for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer.”
“You ought to know.”
The memory of Richelieu annihilates me.
For different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all, and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the Rue de la Monnaie, of the sign of the Hermitage.
But there is the cardinal always at hand, who does not leave me a moment’s repose; who talks to me about Spain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England!
“Very ill,” replied the wounded man.
_La Jeune Amélie_ was first at the rendezvous.
“Yes, sir, you are right in every particular!”
Help, help!” screamed she, turning towards the wall, as if she would tear an opening with her hands.
“No; it is in my arms and shoulders,” answered Porthos with gratified naivete.
When they reached the street, Aramis said:
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act.
“Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner!
Down one of the corridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light were visible.
Grimaud gave a grim smile.
“That is very few,” said the marshal.
In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand.
Now, the queen is of a sensitive nature.
“And I, also,” said D’Artagnan, “I also.
“Oh, no,” returned Monte Cristo negligently; “since I have this, I will keep it.”
“It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?” she asked.
“Oh, what an abyss; what an abyss!” cried Felton.
“Yes, and I say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious, or impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing—then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of predominance.
“No; certainly not.”
“What’s that?”
“Alas!” thought D’Artagnan, “it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me.”
The priest stole the sacred vases, and sold them; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were both arrested.
“Ah!
Laporte entered.
“Why so?” inquired Dantès.
“I have wished, monseigneur, to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in England.
I have, happily, only myself in the world to care for.”
Her crimes, I know them not; her disorders, I know them not; her vices, I know them not.
“And what effect did this discourse produce?” anxiously inquired Albert.
A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old friend.
In short, I see you to tell you that we must never see each other again.”
It was then observable that the substance was greenish.
“Yes.”
M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so that this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be let to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’
“Patience—patience!”
And they both entered M. de Boville’s study.
Now, madame,” said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest of this money, in my hands.”
Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open, and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber, first, a masked man, who, carrying an axe in his hand, was recognized as the executioner.

“Now,” hastily interrupted the Jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was going astray, “now your thesis would please the ladies; it would have the success of one of Monsieur Patru’s pleadings.”
“Oh, not much—from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs.
It is in London they must be found.”
“One of your boarders?” said Milady; “oh, my God!
“And then,” continued Mme.
“The album,” said Edward sulkily.
His visit was announced to the governor, who, on hearing that he came from the cardinal, went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door.
My death, then, will not be to her as the death of a stranger!”
Good-night, friend.”
“The letter was lost,” replied his Eminence; “yes, I know that.
and blood, too!
“No,” said Fernand; “I shall return to the Catalans.”
“As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and gained all the information I could.
“Thanks, monsieur,” said Monte Cristo; “I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.”
“And what are your feelings?” said Monte Cristo, turning to the young man.
“Poor fellow!” said D’Artagnan.
During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie; the horses were also refreshed.
“If you had been ten years engaged in war, as Grimaud and I have been, my dear Blaisois, you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies.
“But,” cried Bonacieux, “this is not Monsieur d’Artagnan whom you show me.”
“No, certainly,” replied Planchet, rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him.
You will give your name to the captain, who will bring you to me.
“Before questioning me,” he said, “reply to my question.
Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.
They did not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered them by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.
The queen stopped him.
You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother.
If you mean to buy any horses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go to Baptiste for it.”
She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband.
The major passed his hand across his brow.
“Toward Paris.”
Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me?”
“Yes.
“Impossible!”
Our Béarnais was a prudent lad, however young he might be.
All his furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.
“I was shouting, ‘Down with Mazarin!’ ‘Death to the cardinal!’ ‘The Italian to the gallows!’ Isn’t that what you would have me shout?”
Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air, and the latter, making an effort, arose and stepped between the two young men.
“Yes,” said Porthos.
Planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord, thought he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master’s guests, named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill D’Artagnan and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service of D’Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after D’Artagnan had saved his life.
“Yes,” said Dantès; “he will not return until the evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.”
In addition to the sword thrust in his arm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his lungs, of which the doctor says bad things.”
“Ah, ah!
“And do you undertake to reform it?”
Dantès reflected, as he worked, on the shout of joy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart; but, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he had already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual questions, his minute observations and evident preoccupation, aroused suspicions.
“You are wrong,” replied Villefort, significantly; “it is important that you should be seen there.”
“Yes.”
“Ah, me!
Mercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s arrest.
“And of what religion are you, then, madame?” asked Felton, with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal.
One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water.
Good-bye;—I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell till I see you again.

“I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same thing,—ill fed and innocent.
“What name did you pronounce then, Madame de Morcerf?” said he.
“Truly,” murmured Valentine, “who on this earth cares for me, if he does not?
“I know it, madame,” replied the count; “but we are in France, and not in Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another.”
Valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read in Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind.
The cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt, and his smile remained as it ever was—false and flattering; and when the queen finished speaking, he said:
A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without smiling or speaking.
I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a pack-thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds.”
“Good heavens!” exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, “surely that is not the voice of the Abbé Busoni!”
At this crisis of the battle, the prince, who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line, appeared in the midst of the fight; his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero.
But what are you doing?
Now, the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter-day payment, and Scarron, as usual, had sent his servant to get his money at the pension-office, but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron.
Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux.”
You look careworn; really, you alarm me.
“Because he is an enemy.”
On their part, the three friends had reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first.
“This devil of a fellow,” he muttered, shaking his head; “I said at the time he would create a sensation here, and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer.
“On your brow I read despair—your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings—your hands tremble.
“Oh, yes, yes; you are right.
“Yes, that was it,” said D’Artagnan, “the story of a tall, fair lady, with blue eyes.”
“Oh!
“How dost thou know?”
“Now, then,” asked Albert eagerly, “have you found the desired cart and oxen?”
“Yes, madame,” replied Villefort, “it is not only projected but arranged.”
“Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,” said Monte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; “and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.”
“Why do you wish to know?” asked Cavalcanti.
Franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle.
All three set off on their walk, Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones.
Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was covered with perspiration.
Bazin remained at the window.
He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter’s by daylight.
Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner, and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep.” Then, the count added aloud, “Was his name ever known?”
“Then all is agreed?” said she.
“Ah!” said D’Artagnan; “a singular commission.”
He was accompanied by another man, who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up, resembling a washing line.
When he arrives, I will not fail to do so.”
died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake.
Then, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent transport of joy.
how you manoeuvre my instructions, count!
“In fact,” he said, as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission, “Athos, for generosity, is a hero of romance; Porthos has an excellent disposition, but is easily influenced; Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance, always illegible.
“Here, in an hour.”
“And he is in the Fort l’Evêque?” said the king.
“The devil!” replied the prince; “surely, at the death of Mazarin.

“No, mademoiselle,” said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question.
The confusion of his mind, the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who, notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him precipitate his course.
If he had not courage he had what is very like it, namely, pride.
“The queen will revenge me, gentlemen.”
I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and let him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand.”
“Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy too many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return, in order to be able to purchase them.”
All Paris seemed to shout with joy, and then the air resounded with the cries of “Long live Broussel!” “Long live the coadjutor!”
Nogent-Beautin, the fool of the court, exclaimed that “the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment.” This caused a universal burst of laughter.
“But,” continued Morcerf, “_à propos_ of Danglars,—we have strangely wandered from the subject.
“Has your husband any Spanish bonds?” he asked of the baroness.
“I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession.”
“It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o’clock.”
Fernand’s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars.
“But why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet—because you are afraid?”
He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Réserve, and which had the postmark, “Marseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 o’clock, P.M.”
“Mine?” exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.
I am going to Beauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.”
“Come, finish your cup of coffee,” said Monte Cristo; “the history is ended.”
“You are right, sir, always right,” said Anne of Austria.
“When a carriage is chosen, it ought to be strong.
“You are right welcome.
“Explain yourself, my lord, I am listening.”
“They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in England.
She passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon her brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor.
They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair.
A large round rock, placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead.
“Well, I have business with the procureur.”
The notary solemnly took the pen, flourished it above his head, and said:
Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe.
“What?” asked D’Artagnan.
In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp.
I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome.—There,” he said, throwing a louis down.
“And a little bit of a thief.”
“Silence,” whispered the duke, “she has her reasons.”
“Shall I ring for Baptistin?”
A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by clasping his hands.
The couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days, and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.
Saying these words, D’Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested—his debt and his life.
Monte Cristo approached her, and silently took her hand.
For the moment she wished nothing better.
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
“He has come, then, as they told me?”
“Indeed, I should think not,” replied Monte Cristo; “dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.”
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see what it is!”
I do not know whether I love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be perjured.
Oh, I cannot tell what she says to me!
“I was so situated as to hear and see everything,” he answered.
“Good-bye, till we meet again.”
In this frame of mind, grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet, pleased with himself, D’Artagnan reached Notre Dame.
Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to the minister—and besides” (Albert looked at his tablets), “it is the hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual.
“And this _carte blanche_,” said D’Artagnan, “this _carte blanche_, does it remain in her hands?”
But the duke is our friend.”
“I do not condemn you, Albert; I only restrain you.
“I have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?”
“Yes,” answered Athos, “but his right place is in our ranks, with the Prince de Conti, De Beaufort, D’Elbeuf, and De Bouillon; but, sir, supposing that the conference is broken off—are you going to try to take Charenton?”
“No—everything is all right now.”
“At one o’clock this morning she had not returned.”
“I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements.”
He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection—the conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death, recurred to him; these symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois.
“About that.”
An hour had elapsed since her condemnation; at that moment, doubtless, she was recalling all her crimes to her memory; she was asking pardon for her sins; perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband—a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death!
“What a singular event!
“But it seems to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward.”
“Well, sir,” at last said Anne of Austria, “you are silent, after rendering such a service?”
THE RENDEZVOUS Chapter XXIV.
“Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence,” replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.
You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name.
My captain is dead; I have barely escaped; but I am a good sailor.
“My God, my God!” said she, “thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer; give me, then, strength to suffer.”
“Revolt!
We can talk of it afterward.”
The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses; the noble animals bounded forward; then cries of men who were knocked down were heard; then a double concussion was felt, and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body.
He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings, and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious smile, at a paragraph headed
“Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died; that is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father would inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.”
Raoul mounted his horse, and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne.
Bonacieux opened the door of a closet, which was entirely dark, and led D’Artagnan into it.
How misfortune humbles a man!”
“Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that you have but one day to work in.”
There was a moment’s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with a foreign accent, said:
Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin.
“Heigho!” said Porthos, opening his large eyes; “what have you got to say?”
Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing both her hands through the opening, she clasped and wrung them.
“But your house is not M. de Morcerf’s,” murmured Mercédès; “and since he has been here I have watched him.”
“Ah!” said Porthos, “what a fearful day, my dear D’Artagnan!”
He thought of that young and pretty Mme.
“The executioner,” said D’Artagnan and Aramis at the same time.
It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man, it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family; it is not only a right, but a duty.”
“Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,” said d’Avrigny.
But where you go, I go.”
From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to one conclusion,—that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life.
“Oh, my lord,” said D’Artagnan, quietly shutting the window, “it is not worth while weeping yet, for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal, whether they be Venetian or Parisian.”
“Oh, growl as much as you please,” cried Lord de Winter, “but don’t try to bite, for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage.
Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny.
Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him.
“Speak out then, say what it was!”
50167m
During this time Valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked leave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure.
Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.
I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging.
“That is impossible.”
“Here you laugh.” The count’s brow became clouded.
“You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some proofs of their truth?” The major drew from his pocket a handful of gold.
So saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the carriage.
Adieu, dear sister, till your next swoon!”
I confess it openly.
Tomorrow morning, at seven o’clock, you will be with me, will you not?”
“Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,” answered Dantès.
“They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur,” he said.
At this moment Planchet brought out Athos’s horse; the Musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle.
“Why so?”
He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one another.
“Which you please, monsieur!” said the light-horseman, drawing from his fob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; “half past seven.”
“What is that?”
“Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”
“Well!” exclaimed Aramis, “this will reconcile me to him; but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an act.”
“Oh,” said Madame de Villefort, smiling, “are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed?”
The eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.
No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it commands it strikes.
The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled; they understood without speaking, their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic.
I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice.”
If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de Tréville’s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence.
“Alas, yes,” returned the Italian.
“Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen.
At six o’clock Lord de Winter came in.
“Ah,” said Andrea, deeply affected.
May I not go and see my friends?”
“Faith!” said Madame de Chevreuse, “say on.
Monsieur le lieutenant, you have been very prompt.
The count said a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed.
“Eh!
“Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket?” asked the duke.
“That is, when I have lighted the match?”
“Then they follow you?” asked Monte Cristo.
“For what reason?”
He then seemed more easy.
“You are right,” said Du Tremblay.
Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through alembics and crucibles?
my strength is failing me; I am dying.”
Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town, Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched.
“Next day—next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when Dantès was arrested.”
Now let us everyone retire to his own home,” said D’Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; “and attention!
I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice.
“And that in the presence of witnesses!
“You, Aramis?” cried the three friends.
He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle.
Do you understand?
After a brief silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the count said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner:
“And I a plain chicken,” said Aramis.
“Eh, rascal!” said D’Artagnan, “do you not recognize his highness the prince’s carriage?”
“Wherefore?”
Oh, Aramis!” continued Athos, shaking his head mournfully, “upon my soul, you make me the most miserable of men; you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship.
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which he had sought at the risk of his life:
“Not that I am aware of,” replied the young man, “unless, indeed, any ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties—your father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other difference between them.
Wretched—wretched that I am!”
“But they believe I am shut up alone here.”
This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos, frightened him.
“Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.”
“Do you know,” said Porthos, “that to twist that damned Milady’s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of Huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the psalms we sing in Latin?”
“They are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are on the other side of the Channel.”
I could drink four more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks.
“Alas,” replied he, “it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips.
I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.”
M. de Tréville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising, approached the young man in order to give it to him.
To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and guarded.
Aramis looked after them, and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Athos.
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.
And yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his heart.
For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so many memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword.
But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken.
“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German, French, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am still trying to improve myself.”
From that glass door the pale-faced man went to the count’s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard.
In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing appearance.
Besides, you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.”
“Hem!
Athos listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness.
“Ah, yes; what could I say?”
“Wholly yours,
“Well, have you sent?” asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel return.
“Poor count!
“Bah!” said D’Artagnan, “they will miss me; if they fire we will ride after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it.
It was not over the downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence.
“Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.”
I went to him and told him all; he knew me, that man did, and did not doubt an instant.
“Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.”
La Ramee entered; he smiled kindly on the prisoner, for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince.
“Where is their road?”
’tis well,” said Porthos, “we shall remember that; but see, there is a postscript from Aramis.”
Each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father,” added Albert with a laugh.
Who informed you this was the master I propose to you?
Not a sound was heard in the castle, except of a footstep up and down, in the chamber above—as he supposed, the bedroom of Athos.
Chapter XLII.
“Yes.”
“But I see much that is very extraordinary in it,” replied D’Artagnan.
Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again twice.
Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the affirmative.
About five o’clock in the evening the island was distinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting.
I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.”
They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the river.
The king sighed deeply, as if his heart would break, and then buried his face in his hands.
Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed to stand on end.
“Madame,” interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, “all that you could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes; the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine.
“But that is not an answer.”
Shot, my dear boy?
“Why, my good fellow, you must be mad!” Then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to himself, “This is annoying,” continued he.
Of whom do you speak?
There must be plenty left,” replied D’Artagnan.
“Yes—your friend at least hopes so.”
She took the risk upon herself.
But you don’t know us; when we can’t have one thing we invent another.”
The young king approached his mother and said, “Why do as these people ask?”
“Oh,” replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, “oh, indeed, Maximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who, they say, never knows fear.
“Waiting for whom?” Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo.
Balls, parties, and _fêtes_ are over; the Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except in Paris.
“There is something true in what you say,” said the count, with that smile which made him so handsome; “I have descended from a planet called grief.”
There is no knight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into the bed of Lord de Winter, my brother.
Milady had, then, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure.
The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the leader’s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became as absorbed as before in what was going on.
“Permit me,” said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to Valentine—“permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility.
“All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs.”
“No,” replied Dantès.
In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her.
Very well done!”
“In the country.”
Villefort traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, “Bring in the prisoner.”
Just reflect a little what an agitation the queen’s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years.”
Monte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together.
“Mundane presumption!”
“What is her name?”
“But what is your own opinion, Albert?”
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres; that is, not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing.
Ah, if you could but help me—if we could both together defeat their plan!
Franz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso.
“Now,” said D’Artagnan, “you wouldn’t be sorry to understand the plot, would you, Porthos?”
A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank into a chair.
“Perhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you, I imagine.”
oh!”
I see no one and yet the ladder didn’t come down of itself.”
“Poor thing,” said Villefort, pressing her hand, “it was too severe for your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet——”
“And he will be guillotined, will he not?” said Caderousse.
You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now, worthy foster-father.”
The door opened, the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind him.
1.F.3.
“Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your conscience.”
in person, and fortunately it seems for you, my young friend.
Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:
“What next?
This was the room appropriated to the sailors.
At sight of this pale, bleeding man, the wife grasped her husband’s arm.
Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest.”
“Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”
“Viscount,” said Athos to Raoul, as he entered, “you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him.”
He made Morrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for the simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait, and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M. Morrel to be admitted.
You must dress him up during my absence.
When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed.
“Upon my word, the drum draws near,” said D’Artagnan.
The conference being finished, the queen summoned him to her cabinet.
“I would rather do so,” was Edmond’s reply, “than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me.”
“Badly enough; but yet I do live.”
“I doubt it, my lord.”
Anne frowned.
“He shall not come in before I am gone,” said he; “and when I am gone, you can open to him.”

Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian; and, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and more especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime.
Is supper ready, Signor Pastrini?”
As to the rest, in eight days you will be where you ought to be, and my task will be completed.”
We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin, and then——”
“Leave me alone,” said Aramis impatiently.
The truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day.
And Mordaunt darted out of the general’s tent, his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy.
This wine will give you strength, drink!” And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman, who drank mechanically.
You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word.”
“Seriously,” said Gondy, astonished at not having further advanced; “I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction.”
And remember, moreover, that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world.
“That is true,” said Porthos.
I enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make.
“Only this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that the villain had to deal with.
Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone, which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes, seemed like “moonlight on a statue,”—yielding light without warmth.
“Ah, Monsieur Mazarin, Monsieur Mazarin,” said Rochefort, leading off his curate, who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue, “you will see whether I am too old to be a man of action.”
La Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud.
Athos, who had pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot.
You must accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you, and on that condition I pardon everything, I forget everything; and what is more,” and she held out her hand to him, “I restore my love.”
Do you not perceive that we are opposite the Hôtel d’Arguillon, which is full of the cardinal’s creatures?
“Meantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased.
D’Artagnan had already opened the door of the second room, and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object.
MILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be present.
THE JOURNEY Chapter XXI.
You will assist me in the work, will you not?”
“Are you sure,” said the queen doubtfully, “that you have not been forestalled?”
As a reply, he wrote the following letter:
All was over; carriages, horses, guards, and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds, when all at once a voice well known to Raoul was heard, and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air; at the same time the crowd opened, upset, trodden down, and an officer of the musketeers, striking and cutting right and left, rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall.
“No,” said the novice, “but of my devotion—of a devotion to a woman I loved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give it still.”
Château-Renaud was at his post; apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances, he required no explanation from Albert.
“Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the gates.”
If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be too great happiness, and I should run mad.
Meanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening.
Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the door, fixing his eyes on the corpse.
They went on through the darkness, silent as phantoms; they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees.
The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur.
“Bravo!
“Alas!” said Valentine, “I see that I have given you pain.
Monte Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he then walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story.
Athos pointed to the bastion.
‘You at Marseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.
“I am going on a mission.”
He was in hunting costume covered with dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand.
The footman’s mission was an easy one.
The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome.
From the former she took some greasy letters, and put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple.
“That was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to confess to you.”
It signifies nothing whether you eat much or little—whether you have ten dishes or one—it is always the same price.”
“But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army; he is entirely devoted to the cardinal.”
D’Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be described.
This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the first, there was no mistaking it.
“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.
so much the better.
During this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that.”
D’Artagnan!” cried Athos, “my son, I entreat you; the wretch is dying, and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him.
The prisoner was led away.
I have no right to it.
“Oh, heavens!” continued Olivain, in despair, “what would the count say if he only saw you now!”
“Ah, you virtuous men!” said Milady; “please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin.”
He saw then that he was with a poet.
“No, monsieur le comte,” answered the servant, “I think not; or at least he has not long been so, for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king, and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes.
“As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle, my dear D’Herblay.
“She seemed to love me so!”
“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo, with the same indomitable coolness; “let us see.
Am I deceived?
You seem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince!
He held out his hand.
1.F.6.
“Are you hungry?” continued he.
“Alas!” said Felton, “I can do but one thing, which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim!
“Who goes there, yourselves?” replied one of the horsemen.
About forty leagues only.
“Honor!
“Bertuccio,” said he, “I intend going this evening to Normandy, instead of tomorrow or the next day.
I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I fancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your excellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears.
The servants had just disappeared under the trees, followed by the tutor, and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off.
“Probably,” said Athos.
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, piqued, “and thanks to my eyes, I can see what other people cannot see.”
Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culprit—she is the poisoner!
One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.
“Oh, the devil!” said Porthos, “I am sorry for that; it would have been one language more.”
D’Artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes.
“You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being as well-dressed as anyone, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your heart.
“What ails you?” said he at length.
“Yes, sire, as they always do.”
The queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen, and among them the Duc de Chatillon, the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of Madame de Longueville, on the Place Royale.
Nevertheless, the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mordaunt.
Anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition.”
Never have I seen you look so young, so beautiful!”
However, he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts.
“It is Ali!” cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.
“Well, then——”
And if death be my lot, I hope to die for the king, for royalty and for God.
Then the landing began.
You have the window, that is sufficient.
A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my History of Louis XIV., I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of M. d’Artagnan, printed—as were most of the works of that period, in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence, more or less long, in the Bastille—at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge.
Chapter IV.
“Yes,” returned Dantès, holding out his hand, “I thank you again.”
I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them back to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands.”
It was time—two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.”
“As it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and as he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots exterminate the Catholics—all in the name of religion—he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a Huguenot.
“Whenever Monseigneur wishes, I am always at at his Eminence’s orders.”
She then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but D’Artagnan kept it free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her eyes, sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the bedstead, while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to Kitty’s apartment.
“No, by your Eminence.”
“We no longer know anyone, madame.”
Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her; they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho.
_My Mass?_ Lord de Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not of his religion, and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me!”
This woman passed for his sister.
Felton snatched away the knife.
“What do you know respecting it?”
The answer known, he had yielded to Albert’s wish to be introduced to Haydée, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Haydée’s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf’s father).
D’Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.
The queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced.
Bravo, bravi, brava!” The banker was enthusiastic in his applause.
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT Chapter XLIV.
Mazarin came within three steps of D’Artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall; the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place.
Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some attention.
“Good, my son.
His best known work is “The Three Graces,” now in the Louvre.
Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for life.
“What on earth are you talking of?”
“What is that?” he inquired.
“For the king’s service we need horses.”
“It is certainly the king,” said the man, rising again.
He has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her in her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty, and even threatens her life.
“Well?”
“Ah, I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter!” And she greedily read the following few lines:
“You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied.
“Well, what has happened to them?”
It appeared likewise that Mme.
“Yes, count,” returned Julie, “we may indeed say he has, for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his angels.”
“Yes, yes,” said Porthos, trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone.
“Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.”
The abbé started.
“You villain, will you finish?” cried D’Artagnan, “Athos—what has become of Athos?”
“Oh, I am never cold, you know!
“Yes, I share your hopes; the anger of Heaven will not pursue us, since you are pure and I am innocent.
“Alas!
The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince.
The Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over the formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his liabilities.
“Indeed?
“Ah, yes!
In an instant we were on the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst the custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the river, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the Rhône to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes.
Besides, who knows whether, divided, we may not obtain a pardon—you from the queen, we from Mazarin—which, were we all four together, would never be granted.
However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dantès did not oppose this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust.
Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!”
But don’t fancy that I am going to take you on your bare word.
“And to which?”
They saw, or rather continued to see, the image of what they had witnessed; but little by little the general vertigo seized them, and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion.
You, who pretend to understand everything, even the hidden sources of knowledge,—and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl!
He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp, without appearing to notice Cavalcanti.
“Sire,——” stammered the baron.
When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, “It appears, then, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone.
“Nonsense.”
She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves.
“Take these documents, then; they do not concern me.
God preserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.”
He formed, therefore, the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future.
“Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d’Épinay?”
“He is in Paris just now.”
“Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind.
Chapter XXIV.
The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and mother were to be reunited with her.
“Send directly to Blois, Raoul; or, rather, take horse and ride immediately yourself.”
...ings have been made
No one answered.
excellency,” returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count’s laughter, had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience.
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Méran?”
“You are a simpleton,” said Athos.
The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity, but he quickly suppressed his emotion.
Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps.
Now, in spite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity.
Not to reflect on what had passed, as one might fancy.
The four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos dominated all the rest.
Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in their arms, and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old man got after her.
“But perhaps they have killed him.”
“Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party?” asked D’Artagnan.
“A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the diamond,—seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in, then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round his head.
D’Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have vanished.
Athos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself in his cloak, and left the hôtel.
“Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly?”
“There,” said he, drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, “there are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with me.
“I swear to you I will.”
“Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait until you hear from me.”
But that is all.
20135m
And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.
“I will see her, D’Artagnan!”
See, John, see how well she knows how to handle a knife.”
“Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning?”
Let us be open with each other and sincere.”
“Well, have you made up your mind to this journey?”
It is not for nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at Tarbes.
Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid.
“The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard.
“Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago.”
“A mischance?” repeated the baroness.
Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux undergo.
“A bad plan; you’ll be shut up again in the Bastile.”
“Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in a position similar to mine.
Is that all you want?”
He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and he appeared.
“Well,” replied La Carconte, “do as you like.
“What are you looking at?”
Milady was livid.
He decided, then, to tell all.
“I am come to fetch you, Monsieur d’Artagnan.”
He immediately called D’Artagnan.
“He went before I came down.”
But after he had gone about two hundred steps D’Artagnan stopped short, alighted, threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddle-bow to fasten them to his girdle.
“Is your love returned?”
“Count,” said the banker, “things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.”
how do I know?
“Ah!
Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight, smell, and respiration.
“A surgeon, reverend sir—a surgeon!” said Caderousse.
I was born in No.
“Well, now that will do wonderfully well,” said Athos.
“Monsieur,” said Athos, placing his hand on D’Artagnan’s shoulder, “monsieur is the Chevalier D’Artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak, Raoul.”
“Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat.”
“I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.”
“And you, you are a woman—a miserable woman, stupid and brutal.
And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes produces a blessing.
We must, then, as it appears to me, travel in company.
The cart was returning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their transport, to slake the wagoner’s thirst along the route.
And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces, which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge.
Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis, called Olivain, the lackey who had followed him from Blois, and made him pack the valise under his own eyes, watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign.
As soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead of one child, he shall have two.
He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.
“To you?
“Nothing broken?” asked De Guiche.
“Yes, if we can.”
“I do not see here,” she said, “anything but general conditions; the interests of the Prince de Conti or of the Ducs de Beaufort, de Bouillon and d’Elbeuf and of the coadjutor, are herein consulted; but with regard to yours?”
Come, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold.”
But D’Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M. Bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend’s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and with the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five.
“Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must know.”
In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistress—but a wife—_diable!_”
The very animals we were speaking of, harnessed to the count’s carriage!”
You are right, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”
“And what did the count do?”
At the extremity of the courtyard, where, close to a portico formed of Ionic columns, were the dog kennels, rose an oblong building, the pavilion of the orangery, a half circle, inclosing the court of honor.
“The man at the telegraph,” said he, “must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture.”
Sometimes on a Sunday, I take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours, in order to pick up a nice little quarrel, which I am really in want of, but nothing happens.
ho!” replied Aramis.
“So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,” said Danglars, bowing to the young couple.
Will he be at home at eight o’clock this evening?”
Debray rose, smiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point, when the door opened suddenly.
There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had been near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.
“And we start in his carriage, then?”
14.”
“Bear with him,” whispered Aramis; “it is doubtless some spy.”
“All those he is in the habit of receiving!” replied Milady, for whom this conversation began to have a real interest.
And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle’s saddle-bow.
“Oh, I don’t doubt that.”
All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred.”
Monseigneur, I was furnished with a description of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances—nothing was omitted.”
The host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their wishes should be attended to; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes.
“But,” said Mazarin, “you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen.”
But his temper cooled down, like his friend’s; he not only gets used to his captivity, but jokes about it.”
“Number 3.”
“Ah!” said the queen to De Winter, “he is one of my faithful adherents; but do you not observe, my dear lord, that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper?”
I learned it since I have been in prison, and that from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissary—an amiable man.”
“My friends will submit them.
“A lost and adored son!”
That is what I want.”
“Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information.
What to me were all the treasures in the world, or all the kings of the earth!
Eugénie bowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, her singing teacher.
Morrel seized the count’s hand and kissed it; the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him.
The committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and silent.
“Well, then,” said Milady, “I confide in my brother; I will dare to—”
Impossible!”
“‘He means,’ replied the man upon his return, ‘that he got in that way;’ and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through.
Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity.
“That I have been singularly assisted.”
“Is this the decanter you spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny.
She believed the order ready for execution.
During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookery—that is, the worst in the world.
We keep him in the cellar!
He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat, which he handed to Mordaunt.
And therefore, my dear Monsieur Bernouin, if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master, announce to her majesty that I have come, and tell her with what purpose.”
Well, he shall live!”
But I lay aside that pride before God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.”
“Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.”
“Which I received this morning.”
While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on Morrel, and remarked that the words, “I shall have left this country,” had failed to rouse him from his lethargy.
Can you enlighten me on that point?”
The first arrivals wore long cloaks, in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped; one of them, shorter than the rest, remained pertinaciously in the background.
There were four Musketeers on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following exercise, while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport.
Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button-hole.
“That I may be sure I have the right man.”
“Ah!” he muttered to himself, “this changes the situation, and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin that we are still, thank God, good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner;” and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five-and-twenty.
“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform.
“No; but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him.”
“Yes.”
“That will do very well,” said Aramis.
“Ah, true.
Ideology
or to speak in plain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything?”
“We have had orders,” answered the man, “to help you in taking care of your prisoners.”
“So much the worse!
“If he only remains here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon re-establish my business.”
Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance, and a low-born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them.
Mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm.
“Yes,” said he, “I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.”
The two friends turned down the first street they came to.
“To no one, by Heaven!
“Now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “go up to your room again; and in ten minutes, I will answer for it, you shall have all you desire.”
my fist is strong enough I swear,” cried Porthos, extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton.
Milady’s supper was brought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloud—prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband, a most austere Puritan.
“Shall I open the secretaire?” asked Valentine.
Let him come.”
They seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio, Giannutri, or Monte Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at Albano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.”
The abbé rose from his chair, made two turns round the chamber, and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat.
The magistrate, harassed and fatigued, had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.
“My dear Porthos, you are really a man of most superior understanding,” said D’Artagnan, with a look as if he spoke against his conviction.
“Does she belong to the family of the celebrated Agrippa, the friend of Henry IV.
“Yes, certainly,” added Athos and the other two.
In whom can I trust?”
No, there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness!
M. Noirtier?”
A great tumult arose, in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard.
We must let Monsieur de Beaufort come.”
Whatever may ensue, I will go.”
“Yes,” replied Aramis, with an absent air; “yes, that poor duchess!
The doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air.
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “has it not been agreed that I should take you with me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure?”
“Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two?” asked the host.
Chapter LXXVII.
Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Tréville loved incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal.
“Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa.
“I will go this very evening to Tréville, whom I will request to ask this favor for me of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart.”
You don’t do your work by halves.
and do you never use your eyes, which must have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the kind of man by whom you are confronted?
Otherwise, you see, although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm, it would have a bad appearance.”
Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon—well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey?
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the Rochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majesty’s Guards, because it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a well-furnished purse in his pocket.
Chapter LVII.
Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first, took his beaver and followed D’Artagnan.
“From Tarbes,” said D’Artagnan.
Now lift me on my bed, for I can no longer support myself.”
Mazarin looked at the young man, but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head; then, embarrassed how to continue such a conversation, he opened Cromwell’s letter.
“And she came back without this casket?”
“The more reason you should fire the first!” cried his foe.
That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget his countenance!”
“Yes, it is an extraordinary story,” said Beauchamp; “is it not?”
Aramis, notwithstanding his self-control, could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise.
And then, shut out from friendship, having but one affection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she thought of herself—of no one but herself.
my dear Porthos.
You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man of your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must form honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life.”
“‘Come, come—give it to me!
“Tell me, Mouston,” said Porthos, “are my arms in good condition?”
Still, the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason.
“I swear to you it is true.
“The child conceals it.”
Olivain was at the same distance in the rear, when suddenly there resounded five or six musket-shots.
It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate, for Maximilian had long awaited her coming.
“But why must you leave me so soon?”
This way—light us downstairs Bernouin.”
The Englishman, with the coolness of his nation, addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles.
I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother.
“Oh,” cried the novice, “as to friends, you would have them wherever you want, you appear so good and are so beautiful!”
At Châlons I was put upon the Saône, thence I passed on to the Rhône, whence I descended, merely with the current, to Arles; at Arles I was again placed on my litter, and continued my journey to Marseilles.
So now, I breathe again—I am happy!”
“I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation, I will just say this much—that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than doubled at the death of M. and Mme.
“You have, no doubt, some order from the cardinal about you?”
“An excellent one,” said Valentine.
“With him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?”
Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men, each capable of killing three D’Artagnans—with two Musketeers, in short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.
“Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?”
“Here is the story, monseigneur,” resumed the trembling host; “for I now recollect you.
“Here is Monsieur Comminges,” said D’Artagnan, returning to the cardinal.
“Certainly,” said Morcerf; “I recollect him perfectly.
Oh, what larks!”
They saw no one, and the bastion seemed abandoned.
“Oh, as to that, I do not engage myself.
And yet he said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with Mme.
“Poor Maximilian!” murmured Valentine.
“But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette?
You were saying, madame——”
“Well, what do you see from this window?
40062m
“Ah, monsieur!” stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, “ah, monsieur, what an escape I have had!”
“And I not at all,” said Mousqueton.
“Never mind,” continued the man in the cloak; “you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission.
“Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.”
“I recognize them,” said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his own signature.
Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart.
Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had been to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English cottons, and we ran our cargo without opposition, and returned home full of joy.
It was Danglars’ letter to the king’s attorney, which the Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson & French, had taken from the file against Edmond Dantès, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville.
Milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel.
You have taken your revenge for the Rue Férou, and even exceeded it; you ought to be satisfied.”
“And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty feet, an enclosure of two acres?”
“But,” said Danglars, “there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs?”
d’Avrigny,” cried Villefort, “I cannot tell you all I feel at this moment,—terror, grief, madness.”
“And therefore,” said D’Artagnan, to clip the hope which Athos’s tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin, “we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity.”
Villefort tried to smile.
“A child!” he exclaimed.
“We shall see,” returned the other, smiling.
“Ah!” exclaimed Anne, following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions, “one regrets Paris!”
“Insane?”
God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space.
“Yes, but in exchange,” said Porthos, covered with perspiration and soiled by dust, “in exchange, I have torn many skins.
She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre.
Edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him.
Valentine, tell him if you love Maximilian.”
The jailer brought him his breakfast.
The union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired.
0173m
Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old man’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child.
It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.
“Ah, indeed!”
Ah, my lord, it is a great happiness that the queen, who always wished you well, had a fancy to send you here, where there’s a promenade and a tennis court, good air, and a good table.”
“And I, likewise,” said Athos.
At the end of a quarter of an hour M. d’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was obliged to open to them.
“What then?”
Etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him.
Many women held their infants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.
“At the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning.
At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.
This is not the Hôtel des Princes.”
Wait.”
He fainted.
“Doubtless I may, but——”
“Oh!” cried Porthos, “oh!
Then he arranged all his beautiful Turkish arms, his fine English guns, his Japanese china, his cups mounted in silver, his artistic bronzes by Feuchères or Barye; examined the cupboards, and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer of his secretaire, which he left open, all the pocket-money he had about him, and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel-boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything, and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table, after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there.
“The one in the dark blue coat?”
“Ah, monsieur,” returned Albert, “I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this.
“What are you doing?” said he.
“Will that be the answer,” replied the secretary, smiling, “which he must transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great Britain?”
“Well,” asked the count in Arabic, “have you been to see the old man?” Ali made a sign in the affirmative.
“Let us talk of something else,” said he.
“Exactly,” answered the musketeer.
“‘Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.’
“I have an idea,” said D’Artagnan.
“Two soldiers,” said D’Artagnan, seeming to remember something, “two soldiers, yes; that, then, is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour, under my window.”
He drew back a step, and hung down his head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if, fascinated by this strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from her eyes.
“Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the house.”
“I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.”
“Child!” replied the count.
Where does your highness wish to go?”
“Courage, madame!
D’Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great delusion.
“M.
I have bought them, and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts, that is, in villages, where no one generally stops.”
On reaching the door, he bowed.
“Yes,” replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, “I was in the south of France.”
Five millions on five little scraps of paper!—it must be seen to be believed.”
Her elbows were placed upon a mean table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as ivory.
“And have your notions changed?” asked Dantès with much surprise; “do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me?”
I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy—”
The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the porter’s lodge, saying:
Come back, sirs, back.”
Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles; for they well knew what those propositions were, to whom they had been made and who had made them.
“Lord de Winter!” exclaimed the queen, “the friend of my husband.
Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world.
“Do you agree with Aramis?”
Monsieur de Tréville is ill, so my company can’t do without me; there!
“Speak, my child, speak,” said D’Artagnan; “I listen.”
The surprised groom retired.
what do you say?” cried D’Artagnan.
“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation.
“Ah, father,” said Albert with a smile, “it is evident you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself with those written on his passport.”
Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?”
The first he comes to!
“Oh, you are no stranger—at least not by name,” replied Madame Danglars, “and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you.
“Let us not talk about money, if you please; it is humiliating.”
“That ring I have!
“Come in here, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she; “here we shall be alone, and can talk.”
It was never without a nervous shudder, since the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which followed it, that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristo’s name announced.
“The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just.
“Here comes M. Morrel back.
Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the room.
A peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain alone.
“Oh, no!
He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future.
“Regret?”
The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled with interest.
Ha!
Mordaunt was among these.
Chapter 11.
He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the treasures.
His fearless deportment, his words, so firm, yet dignified, the shades which by one word he had evoked, recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance, youth, beauty, the eclat of love at twenty years of age, the bloody death of Buckingham, the only man whom she had ever really loved, and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king.
“Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his immediate return.” Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against the gate.
“Enough,” said Mercédès; “enough, Edmond!
“I am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.”
“That is best,” said the king.
On the way we escaped.
“Ah!” said Athos, “how much time we have lost.”
“Well, madame,” said Porthos, “if he owed you more than five crowns, your horsedealer is a thief.”
“Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.”
Let us see what this letter contains.”
Here were not, as in other tombs, ignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall from the vault itself.
I shall see everything, and at the least suspicious sign I shall begin to exterminate.”
Then, when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated their flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position.
“Is that his Christian name?”
Athos, with his superior understanding, wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion, and at the moment when his friends, in deference to his deportment and sobriety, dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners, he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners—a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables.
From the manner in which you walked and talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls telling your secrets to each other.”
“And yet,” he said, “I must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to quiet service; I have certain apprehensions—well, what is the meaning of that?”
it is not the king!” exclaimed the cavalier.
Mazarin started, turned toward the Comte de la Fere, and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance, took the pen.
Come along, Danglars, and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.”
“Phew!” whistled Planchet.
“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions accord with my request?”
It would be, no doubt, _parbleu_, if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance, of the horrors of the cardinal—”
At this moment the clock struck six.
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise.
“And Paris?”
He accepted, therefore, with delight, an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the Duc de Grammont, to give him a substitute; he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny, who promised that he would not oppose it in any way—that is, if he approved of the person proposed.
you, Rochefort!
Albert returned safely—then the count was revenged.
“Half-past twelve,” he said.
My God, my Lord, I have long despised thee!
“Have I not, then, that right?” cried the queen.
“Why did he not bring it to me here?”
How does it happen that you are in Paris?”
“When?”
“And where is the governor?”
Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door, we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone.
Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantès almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating.
Then, too, my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word.
“No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner of Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500 francs.”
“Well,” pursued Caderousse, “can you without expending one sou, put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs?
“Ah, he’s quite another sort of person—a formidable gentleman, indeed.
“Well, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six o’clock in the morning.”
“But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus,” said the cardinal.
In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper.
“To be sure we will,” replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the world, “to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this Bastille.”
“To the king?”
“Come to our house tomorrow.
Queen Elizabeth and Catherine II.
“That’s it!” cried the king; “to him, no doubt.
“Pshaw!
The king feared an outbreak.
The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down.
Some Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch.
“Foolish creature,” he exclaimed.
M. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered into the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there.
To be a great chemist in the East, one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.”
She was free now to give way to her transports without being observed.
I am here to petition you, too happy should my prayer be favorably heard.”
D’Artagnan, leaning on Athos, made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms, who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others.
“Well, monsieur le comte,” said the duchess, smiling, “does one leave so solemnly his old friends?”
“Well,” said Franz, “this time, M. Albert, I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea.”
“Well, then, to my health!
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured Kitty, “he has not even waited for the hour he himself named!”
Besides, we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin, and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal, and are, therefore, as ambassadors, able to act with impunity, a thing that General Oliver Cromwell, who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general, is quite the man to understand.
His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat.
“Here is the passport,” said the postilion, “which way are we going, young gentleman?”
Beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.
And I, doctor—you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupy—one has not been king’s attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies; mine are numerous.
“Will you permit me to inquire,” said Madame de Villefort, as she arose to take her leave, “whether you usually reside here?”
“Yes.”
“Then Monsieur is satisfied?” asked Planchet.
“It is he; it must be he!” murmured Tréville.
“I must put this to the test, but without compromising anybody.
“No, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible.
“I asked,” said Athos, in the same language, “if there are two parliaments, a pure and an impure?”
It frequently occurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners.”
“That is the very truth,” cried the mercer; “but Monsieur does not tell you—”
You say you fear nothing but death?”
“In that case, let there be no more question of what’s past, and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him.”
“In what year?”
“Where is he?”
“Albert,—While showing you that I have discovered your plans, I hope also to convince you of my delicacy.
Ten days passed away thus.
“And I some lamb chops,” said Porthos.
“No, friend,” replied Raoul, smiling, “I am obliged to you, but at this moment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked—only I shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good; upon these conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle, and for the ink the price of the pie.”
“And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers?”
It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone supported him, sank upon his knee.
“Well, but,” said Aramis, “have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent?
who would ever have thought it?”
THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BÉTHUNE Chapter LXII.
“Here it is,” said he.
“Oh, Lord, no!
It happened that on this particular night the minister’s box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again, upon his rejection of it by Mercédès, sent it to Danglars, with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in question.
All Paris were in the streets.
“I have told you.
“Which?”
“By the telegraph, sire.” Louis XVIII.
“Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.”
“Exactly what I wish for; I will apprise my mother of my intention, and return to you.”
He had retired at one o’clock under the pretense of being indisposed.
“I was looking for you, my friend.” Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,—
He was received by Baptistin.
“Good-morning, my dear host,” cried D’Artagnan.
“Forgive, Edmond, forgive for my sake, who love you still!”
For the story?
“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.”
Bazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for performing his commission.
The past, like the country through which we walk, becomes indistinct as we advance.
“Why, what in the world,” cried Aramis, “is that animal Bazin doing?
“So curious, that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character.”
Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward; but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm.
Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me.
And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes, which might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared to lose.
“I know it well, so take Grimaud.”
Bonacieux the second time, as he had carried her off the first.
Of course, we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter.”
“You have found that out, have you, my lord?
“Come in here,” said d’Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay.
“Tell me.”
“By whom?” inquired Cromwell.
“And who is the assassin;” they asked together.
It bears his signature, as you see, which is all-sufficient.”
Let us know when breakfast is ready.
“For stealing!
The English, who require, above everything, good living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad biscuit, had many invalids in their camp.
The blood no longer flowed from his wounds.
“Yes,” replied the narrator; “that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his own.”
Danglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage.
and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville; and if the worthy Broussel were there, whom you so stupidly helped arrest, I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks.”
Goodnight.” And before Dantès could open his mouth—before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water—before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door, leaving stamped upon the prisoner’s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon.
“So that, as you confess, you are jealous?”
Villefort’s brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with apprehension.
Now, should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?”
“Undoubtedly.”
Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings, to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom.
“I never joke with bankers,” said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner, which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the valet de chambre announced:
Chapter XLIV.
“Beware of what you do!” cried the young woman, in a manner so serious as to make D’Artagnan start in spite of himself.
“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.
“Oh, that would be too much!” cried Mme.
“Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson, Edward de Villefort?”
At these words he gave me a ring.
“This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”
“To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?”
The pike, eels, and carp eat greedily always, as everybody knows—well, they feast on the vulture.
The count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then again rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled.
France enfeebled, the authority of her sovereign contemned, her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence, her enemies within her frontiers—all proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence.
Chapter 63.
We have before stated that all the servants had fled.
Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him.
“So that since that time—” replied D’Artagnan, totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.
D’Artagnan had not been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him, hoping that the young man’s death would be placed to the account of the enemy.
“Sir,” replied Raoul, bowing, “I am entirely at your service, I assure you.”
“He may have gone by the other door.”
Bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.
“I am not at home to any one,” said the Duchess de Chevreuse to the footman.
The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès—Hope.
“But yet, detail them to me.”
“So then,” he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, “seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man.
“Very willingly, if it be necessary to reassure you,” answered the minister, and Mazarin, who was delighted to get off so cheaply, led the way, in high spirits, to the corridor and opened the door.
To whom?
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.
He insisted upon it, declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished.
“I offer my best respects and services to you, my lord.”
Aramis went off at once, begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of D’Artagnan and Porthos; a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile.
“In the first place, light me a torch.”
“I suspect,” said he, “a tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the air of a great lord.
Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”
Although a Christian, may God forgive me, I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father.
It was about nine o’clock in the morning.
“Oh, that is not my secret.”
“And I, too,” said Porthos.)
“Thank God you have come!”
Let us suppose one thing,” replied the duke “let us suppose, for instance, that my maitre d’hotel, Noirmont, has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau——”
But what if I were mistaken?”
“‘Monsieur,’ said Emmanuel, ‘have the goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay.
The only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself.
“Well, my dear viscount,” said Monte Cristo, “I have an infallible remedy to propose to you.”
The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back.
“Oh, there is no difficulty in that.
“No.”
On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria’s last winding-sheet,—a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so little.
The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we shall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.
“Four hundred, at a pistole each, four hundred pistoles.”
“And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernajoux.”
“Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons.
“You saw the emperor, then?”
“Well, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission,” said D’Artagnan.
Do you not, father?”
“That is not the custom, excellency,” said Peppino.
“What a dire misfortune!” said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and Danglars.
He begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him.
As for Porthos, he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them.
“The place, madame, is vacant, and although ’tis a year since Monsieur de Tréville has left it, it has not been filled.”
“No, my friend,” Athos gently replied, “but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us, Monsieur d’Herblay and myself, to Madame Henrietta.
Mercédès, I must revenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,—fourteen years I wept, I cursed; now I tell you, Mercédès, I must revenge myself.”
Dantès shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison.
Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed Dantès, pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.
It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first time, and during those three years I have loved you thus.
“And that is the very thing that alarms me,” returned Dantès.
“Well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that I eat.”
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.
This probability afforded him his first consolation.
“You know, Albert, women are singular creatures.
“What is the matter, Maximilian?” asked he; “you are pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead.” Morrel fell into a chair.
“Take care of your horses!” cried D’Artagnan to him.
“Ah, my dear father!” said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the count might hear him in the next room, “is it really you?”
“Devil take the vain fellow,” said D’Artagnan.
“To Calais,” said D’Artagnan; “that is the most direct line to London.”
“Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him, and I should have news from those without the prison walls.”
“Who?” asked his Eminence.
“Do I?
Well, then, Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist, and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns.
But, then your word is given.”
I then was ready to dismount, but it was too late; I descended into the arms of the archers.
Chapter 60.
Felton arose.
“Hush!” interrupted the stranger; “I hear a noise.”
“Oh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of her thus!” cried the novice, with enthusiasm.
“How do you know that?” asked the guide in astonishment.
“The cardinal won’t allow it.
“Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and I have forgotten them.”
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment.
0307m
Many people have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial.
I wish I had never seen you!” cried D’Artagnan, with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness, because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason.
“Athos,” replied the Musketeer.
The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Méran coffins.
“Of course.
Their three graves were there, rising above the ground, and a fourth was also there, yawning for its ghastly tenant.
Athos smiled with ineffable pleasure.
Morrel reflected.
He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she allowed to be seen, “What is this, madame?” he asked coldly.
Do you think he would recollect you?”
“Certainly.
But Mazarin is a low-born rogue, who can at the most take us by the collar, like an archer.
M. d’Avrigny opened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed the door.
But, would you believe it, ‘He was not receiving.’ So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty.
_Ventre-saint-gris_, Monsieur de Tréville, as the king my father would have said.
“I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you, but it is, at least, a ray of light in a dark night; by following it we may, perhaps, discover something more certain.”
Dantès paused a moment, then said, “This is it, word for word: ‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris.
“It is good advice,” said Athos, “and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him.”
“The fact is,” said Porthos, “Aramis is of the same height, and something of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a Musketeer—”
Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment from his new master.
“You spoke to me,” Athos resumed, “of Porthos; have you persuaded him to seek his fortune?
“Two gentlemen.”
On their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter:
“Five hundred pistoles.”
Pardon me for interrupting you, but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me.”
“Well, like all Paris, I shall be there too,” said the count.
The solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the Château d’If, which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead—all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality.
“‘“Now am I at liberty to retire?” said the general.
I only speak that exact truth.”
I’ll circulate that saying, be assured, my dear fellow.
All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall.
Marry, forsooth, people don’t die of hunger here.”
“The note is changed.
“What my maid tells me.”
Although my name, or rather that of my brother, would be mixed up with the affair, I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you.”
“You think so?”
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.” Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: “A thousand pardons!
“Go and fetch Lord de Winter,” said Felton, tired of these eternal complaints.
“Certainly,” remarked Porthos.
Milady smiled, and D’Artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile.
Immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire.
Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he closed after him.
“Stop a bit!” said Aramis.
At the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.
“What did it taste like?”
“A natural son.”
I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant.”
“You say, then,” he continued, “that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal?”
“You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.”

The commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters.
“I passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward midnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness.
“My lord,” answered Comminges, “he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur d’Artagnan is confined—that is, in the hunting lodge, opposite the orangery.”
He entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand on the pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.
What is it, then?”
Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I shall be happy to see him.”
“The French ladies, madame.
“Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour.”
I will wear it, I swear to you, as a grateful man should do.”
“Therefore you love me a little, I hope,” replied Athos, in a tone of emotion.
Well, did there not happen an event which saved Austria?
“Nothing,” replied Bonacieux, “nothing.
I have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake, for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment (you admire candor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain commercial speculations I am desirous of entering into.” Eugénie became uneasy.
He will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity, which he will convert into prosperity.
Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.
what a horrible scene!
“Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles I.
“Will you dress here?”
Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night.
“Well, and what may you have to say against this name?” inquired Albert; “it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth, I must confess.”
While you are fighting if there is a fight, he must flee.
This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh.
It appeared, then, to D’Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon.
Don’t try to understand it—you will only lose your time.”
“None.”
The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation.
“From that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet.”
“I?
“My dear Fellow,
Therefore, when, at dessert, upon a sign from D’Artagnan, Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone:
“I, indeed?
HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS Chapter XXX.
“Adieu, count,” said the Abbé d’Herblay; “I return to my convent.”
“Courage, mother!
When he came here, Monsieur D’Artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers, in order, I suppose, to have his sword back.
At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the creaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above, raised his head.
Did you not say she was dead?”
Then our Gascon, extending his arms, drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another.
Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements, made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard, and threw down, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris, muttering,
“He has told you rightly.
At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to faint.
Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed?”
“Mordaunt,” he cried.
“Gracious me!
I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.
“Well, are you going away in that manner?
“And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days?
20185m
“Holidays?”
The duchess smiled, half tenderly, half ironically.
The duke smiled with bitterness.
At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter.
The count felt his heart beat more rapidly.
It was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens, concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.
“You consent then?” exclaimed the queen, joyfully.
“But will that not excite suspicion, sir?” asked the queen.
“Ah, it is M. de Morcerf,” said Monte Cristo quietly; “I thought I had not heard aright.”
And D’Artagnan dressed himself in an instant.
At the outer door the steward paused.
“MARIE MICHON”
all England is with Cromwell; and since you ask for my prisoners, I bend, sir, to your wishes.
“No,” replied Athos, “fortunately Monsieur d’Artagnan has only fainted.”
I command thee!” said the duke.
The latter obeyed without reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be expected.
Chapter LXXVIII.
Do you think of him?”
“Locked!” repeated Mousqueton.
Let us try him.”
“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron.”
She was talking with great animation with the stranger.
The meetings were always held from that time till midnight.
No, I am wrong.
The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.
Athos smiled.
“‘Well, we must try to take him alive.
“Interested man!” cried she, smiling.
GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM Chapter XIII.
Dividing the Proceeds
“And does he suspect,” said Mme.
The breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table.
The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris.
They quitted Paris, beholding it abandoned to extreme want, bordering on famine; agitated by fear, torn by faction.
“Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.”
“Have you no idea whatever?”
You have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.”
34.”
The cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament, and to attire himself in the military coat, which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace, owing to his former campaigns in Italy.
By Alexandre Dumas, Père
“The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important business calls him to Malaga.”
I would take the hundred pistoles.
“Hold your tongue, Porthos,” said Athos; “you are insupportable.”
you are laughing at me.”
Look, gentlemen, all!’
“All.”
At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his eyes.
“Well, sir, though honor is a fine thing, they are tired of fighting for it, and to-night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds—that is to say, for half what is owing them.”
“There is no room for him, he will rejoin your eminence.”
But I must not forget one grand point.”
When he had finished, he said:
The Unknown Chapter 26.
She took me away without speaking.
I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle, which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely.
D’Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.
“He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged.”
“A desert would not have been amiss,” said Porthos; “but it behooved us to find it.”
Love me then, Haydée!
serpent,” muttered D’Artagnan, “I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name.”
Porthos, who had not spoken one word, answered merely by a word and a gesture.
“Oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize.
“Dear Constance!
In fact, as this last reflection indicated—this instinctive return to hope—sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit.
This is all I know, but I know not, count, how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything.
“Yes, go.”
He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he had come; but she added, “Poor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to kill.”
The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of D’Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was convinced.
He saw D’Artagnan’s movement, heard the sound of the click, and stopped at once.
Well, what is the matter?”
It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration.
“The Comte de la Fere is a demi-god.”
“He was Cardinal Richelieu’s creature, my lord.
“Andrea Cavalcanti.”
The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé’s ladder of cords.
“Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_?”
“Did you see nothing there?” asked the count.
Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.”
The count alone seemed unmoved—nay, more, a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks.
The two children met, sat down near each other, let their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed together; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock from those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their respective farms, promising to meet the next morning.
You know, dear D’Artagnan, I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman.
Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray, Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud.
In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready, but he looked around in vain for his friend.
The storm broke about ten o’clock.
Die in peace!”
“That is true.”
“No you will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.”
“Depend upon it, I know what I say.
Nor was this all.
CAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY
‘All hands to the pumps!’ I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in.
A woman with Athos!
God sends me this, and I hail it joyfully!”
“A scar on his temple!” cried D’Artagnan; “and with that, white teeth, a piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage—why, that’s my man of Meung.”
“A prisoner, you will not recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose your life through me.”
Monsieur de St. Merri, you begin.”
“This is capital!” said Athos to Aramis, “we were to have slept here, but we cannot—we must push on.” They rode forward and reached Abbeville.
It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut, in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into Madame Villefort’s dressing-room—I saw, I tell you, silently enter, a white figure.”
“Pardon for what?” asked she.
“You approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock.
Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.”
“The passports are in order; let these three gentlemen pass.”
Valentine
No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of, shone in its splendor.
Three times I presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away.”
“Wait a little, Porthos, before crying out; for, on my word, you haven’t reached the end,” said the Gascon, in a jesting tone.
He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called out.
M. de Tréville listened to the young man’s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair.
He was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner.
You live on your estate, happy in golden mediocrity.
“What horse dost thou choose for thyself?”
Get your clothes together.
One thing above all the rest heightened the respect, nay almost the veneration, of Danglars for Cavalcanti.
Their course was clearly defined: they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right.
Where, my God?”
“It is true,” said Athos, “but this child comes in the name of Heaven.”
Perhaps what I am about to say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me.”
20009m
Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.
Athos’s horse, where is that?”
DREAM OF VENGEANCE
Mazarin pretended to laugh.
Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to fail her at the decisive moment?
For three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with the Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have preserved its language.
Morrel shook his head sorrowfully.
“All which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son-in-law, sir!
Anger mounted to D’Artagnan’s face; he frowned and his cheeks were colored.
“Yes.
“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can see to work in the dark?”
And he jumped off his horse.
Come, Aramis.”
“What then?”
Saint Denis.
Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after D’Artagnan.
“But if he be a spy——”
“Well,” said Danglars, “did you see him?”
But before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants who were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.
Trembling, his hair erect, his brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart.
“I hate them?
The sultans and viziers who rule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and _ennui_.”
“Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.”
“Do not be intimidated.
Never mind,” said Milady, writing the name on half a sheet of paper; “I will compromise myself.”
D’Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired.
“One only?”
Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child.
Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say:
Now, supposing I am deceived, supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness.
Look at the Comte de la Fere, a type of nobility, a flower of chivalry.
If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight o’clock in the evening you are not here, no money—even if it be but five minutes past eight.”
You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to Paris, without drawing a trigger.”
The cardinal put it on in military style.
“That’s well!” said Athos, filling his glass and that of his friend; “here’s to Porthos and Aramis!
A Letter from Charles the First.
D’Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses.
Are you making a sketch after Poussin?”
The queen, on her part, thus chided, softened immediately and sat down, and in an almost weeping voice, letting her arms fall by her side, said:
He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise; every one, therefore, believed him to be dead, especially those to whom his death would give promotion.
“Tony,” he said, motioning to his groom to approach.
“Two young gentlemen, who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mention—the Viscount de Bragelonne.”
“Well, go quickly!
Porthos!
Where have you read in the Scriptures, I ask you, that the English are your neighbors?”
“The abbé, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small two-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant.
Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to London and back.
“It is not worthwhile.”
“What will I do with him?
“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the house?—can I not escape?”
“Yes, and for a considerable sum.”
“Oh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding _grisette;_ from Madame de Chevreuse’s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a duchess’s coronet.”
“What do you mean by that, monsieur?”
“Officer!” cried Grimaud.
This was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more frequently than any other, and one that bowed her head with shame.
“I think I may venture to ask you this favor.”
“My lord,” replied Guitant, “I was observing that we live in troublous times and that to-day’s events are very like those in the days of the Ligue, of which I heard so much in my youth.
And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as Franz had never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity.
“See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of great geniuses.”
“What has become of Monseigneur Athos?” asked he.
Madame Bonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.”
“This wound?
“That is true, and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity, if posterity ever looks at us.
At bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.
Let us get ready, gentlemen.”
“You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father; you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.”
For an instant he feared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy, between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne.
“Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange—the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?
That’s against all rules.
The Flight.
cowardly court!
“Well, I will remain with you.” At this moment Villefort returned, followed by the lady’s maid; and after her came Madame de Villefort.
“Did you observe anyone during the first act?” asked Château-Renaud.
“Why so?”
Noirtier watched her with evident anguish.
Having passed through the Rue du Mont-Blanc, guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path, he found himself at the end of the Rue La Fayette.
“But what have I done to you?” exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality; “what have I done to you?
This was to go himself to M. de la Trémouille.
“Will you see the register at once,” asked the governor, “or proceed to the other cell?”
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.
“Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?” said the magistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife and the door.
I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.”
“The duvil!” said the Swiss, “if she is as great a lady as her writing is large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!”
“Suddenly?”
“Say it, my father.”
Trust me, don’t let us try to do things cheaply.
“And you were wrong, madame.
“Lord a mercy, my lord!
Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.
“You deceive me, madame,” said the novice; “you have been his mistress!”
“Excellency,” cried the _cicerone_, seeing Franz approach the window, “shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?”
But what do I see in the water—something struggling?”
I have not forgotten all I owe thee.
Then aloud:
“God abandons him who abandons himself,” said Milady.
Mercédès extended her hand to the count.
“What is that?”
“And how were they treated?” asked D’Artagnan.
“But that is not all, madame.
“‘Why should you threaten me with death,’ cried I, ‘when I have already declared my innocence?’
This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.
“Help, help!”
Do you believe it was because I committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV.
As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.
Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for.
“Edmond,” said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke, “how noble it is of you, how great the action you have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old with grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my Edmond by a smile, or by a look, of that Mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating.
I was sent there to intercept a correspondence between Chalais and the archduke, and even then, when I was discovered I was nearly torn to pieces.
Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my history.”
“Yes, monsieur.”
“It is she!”
Too long a wait—too long.”
He had now leisure to look to his wound.
“Except you, Athos, who never had one.”
Formerly his paper, at any date, was taken with confidence, and was even in request.
In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.
“Indeed!” replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment, “you really do seem very well informed.”
Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us; we will cross the Tyne, reach Scotland, and you will be saved.”
you will be deceived just the same,” said Athos, who was an optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men were in question.
“Why, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion.”
“That just shows the meanness of this slander.
“Beware, young man!” cried Tréville.
I should be too happy to be of any service to her.
What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced?—none whatever.
“Tell me,” cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealing—“tell me that you wish to despoil me of all; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.”
Athos was the last to enter.
Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had found him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial politeness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the vulgar man.

“My name is Mordaunt,” replied the young man, bowing.
“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.”
In fact, it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be mistaken.”
“But apropos of Debray, how is it that I have not seen him lately at the baron’s house?”
_prorsus admirabile!_” continued Aramis; “but which requires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers.
There was a moment’s silence.
“And who told you this fine story, sire?” asked Tréville, quietly.
The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet, who made a sign to D’Artagnan.
“What else?”
Bonacieux once again, and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.
“I grant it, monsieur,” replied Madame de Chevreuse with her most gracious smile.
“I have, however, already told you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.”
“Well, that will do charmingly,” said the count; “but may I beg that the greatest haste may be made, for I have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to-morrow night in Paris!”
“Well, in that case, we can manage famously,” said D’Artagnan; “which of the two horses will you ride—that which you bought or the one that was given to you?”
“Very well; but it is already five o’clock, so make haste.”
The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that now they have scarcely any.
“Horrible!” cried De Winter; “the daughter of Henry IV., and the wife of King Charles!
When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly wounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.”
“Eh?” cried the young man, turning pale.
What do I say?
What must I do?”
The general was pacing the room the third time when, in turning, he perceived Monte Cristo at the door.
20211m
“It appeared light and well constructed.”
Stop, my friend, I have an idea.”
I was there, too, and I never shall forget the old man’s smile at this prescription.
“And how many hours of reflection do you ask?”
All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I recognized him.”
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of Porthos, the exploits of our youth?”
“I hope so, monsieur.”
“All men are brothers,” said the Puritan.
The perfidious deceiver was, as may plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor girl in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.
Anne of Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door.
This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was called Il Signor Giacomo Busoni.
All very fine, my lord, but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will strangle you and become Frondist.
“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”
“Above all things be always on your guard.
“Will it be long first?” muttered Villefort, saluting the minister, whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach.
Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king.
“Yes.” There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer, no one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.
Athos smiled.
Porthos had, in fact, been involved in a dispute with the Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property, which adjoined his own, and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension, he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added that name to his others.
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I have heard that; but, as Claudius said to Hamlet, ‘it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them, and they mourned their loss; they will die before their children, who will, in their turn, grieve for them.’”
Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband, and although I am only your brother-in-law, I will arrange one similar.”
“You are exaggerating, Athos; we are not so far gone as that,” replied the lieutenant.
This did not seem sufficient; the man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.
D’Artagnan hits on a Plan.
“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “you are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl.”
In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.
I was speaking of your father’s past history.
“Is it your decision, Athos?” resumed the Gascon.
“Of the handkerchief?”
“Yes; read it.”
“I think we are all taken prisoners, except Aramis, and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarin’s mousetrap.”
No, no—look, look!”
D’Artagnan left Athos’s chamber and went to that of Porthos.
“You are right,” said D’Artagnan; “I will have done with her.
“Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!” cried Mercédès, stretching out her arms to him from the balcony.
“That is to say, I guess your wishes, and that is all that’s necessary,” said Madeleine.
“Forsooth, I don’t know.”
Planchet!”
“No, don’t be alarmed, although it is to a lady that I am going to present you, and I am anxious that you should love her——”
The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves your Majesty too well.”
He sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him.
Will your eminence please read and examine?”
“Hush,” said the count, “do not joke in so loud a tone; Haydée may hear you, perhaps.”
D’Artagnan pursued his way.
“As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree, to the wing of a pigeon, to the collar of a dog.”
At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.
The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes; he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf.
“Oh, no!” cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth.
“Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees.
“Tomorrow!
“But what is it?”
“You are welcome, count!” she exclaimed, as he entered.
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
“On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of Monte Cristo.
“On the contrary, sire, set the example.
“I do not understand, my Lord,” said she, in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out.
“I will repair it, indeed I will, my dear Porthos.”
Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths.
“Yes.”
“I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s lemonade—that’s all.” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him.
Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen you at my house?”
20027m
Once in London we shall be hard to find—without considering,” continued Athos, throwing a glance at Aramis, “the chances that may come to us on the way.”
Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?”
It was, then, Richelieu’s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of France, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.
“And now,” said the queen, addressing D’Artagnan, “what is to be done?
just so, gentlemen!
Would you like such a post?
“I don’t know what you mean, nor do I even desire to know what you mean,” replied the cardinal; “but I wish to please you, and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature—the more so as you tell me this D’Artagnan is a libertine, a duelist, and a traitor.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” replied Felton, quietly, “and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking, my Lord.
Ascribe to men, then, what is happening, and not to God.
See!
“Madame,” replied De Winter, “provided I can find some of my good old friends of former times I will answer for anything.”
They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them; and, in fact, they went away quite proud and happy.”
“Oh, mon Dieu!” he said, raising his fine eyes to D’Artagnan, moist with tears, “the count has left Paris without seeing me?”
Many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me; so you see in what a situation I am.”
“But this is all I have left in the world,” he said, “out of an immense fortune.
Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.
“The prince will vanquish you, as he has always done.”
By the latter I mean your relatives and friends.
That’s unpardonable in a man of your age, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.”
there’s a fellow who will never desert me!”
“Oh, do not fear, my friend,” said Morrel, raising his head, and smiling with a sweet expression on the count; “I shall no longer attempt my life.”
This petition to Napoleon, kept back by Villefort, had become, under the second restoration, a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king’s attorney.
Pah!”
Whilst this scene was going on, D’Artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze.
On arriving at the king’s private antechamber, M. de Tréville found La Chesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la Trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel, that he returned too late to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.
At the same minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared.
“It is this, sir,” said the king, angrily, “that General Cromwell has reached Newcastle; that you knew it and I was not informed of it; that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the Tyne against us; that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have been left unacquainted with it; that, by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament.
For my part, I declare I want two thousand.”
They entered; behind a glass window, by the light of the cardinal’s lantern, which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery, they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil, in long lines, forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys.
I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie, who does not seem to be much in favor just now.”)
In France, my dear sir, half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years, for change of air.”
Is it as good now?”
The brief space had, however, been sufficient for a man, followed by a number of servants, to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman opened the door of the carriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy, who had lost consciousness.
Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman.
“My Lord, excuse me!
“The devil!” said Porthos; “in that case they have eaten everything.”
All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis called, and had guessed, from M. de Tréville’s tone of voice, that he was very angry about something.
We have had great annoyances there.
THE DROP OF WATER Chapter LXIV.
There was a crowd on the pier.
I heard the name of Rochefort.
“Ah, yes!
my friend!
He then asked with whom he played.
He is a coward.”
“And yet,” said Athos, with his habitual calmness, “if it be Monsieur d’Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can take his place.”
Several persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your banker.
Do not you recollect, I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come today to plead for justice.
“But your honor will soon be called so generally.”
“MILADY DE ——
“You know,” resumed D’Artagnan, “that she has had leave to return to France?”
“No, for two hundred thousand francs.
“Beware,” said M. d’Avrigny, “it may come slowly; you will see it approach after having struck your father, your wife, perhaps your son.”
The abbé made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again opened his eyes.
“And I,” he said, “I feel that my place is not in the judge’s seat, but on the prisoner’s bench.”
I had been told that you had endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Château d’If, and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers.
In fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand; but these last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her strength, and even her will.
It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady.
“Oh!
Edmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound was heard from the wall—all was silent there.
“This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation, madame,” replied Monte Cristo bowing.
In a moment the door was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son’s arm.
“Undoubtedly;—at ten o’clock at night his horses took him to the barrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him—he entered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to Fontainebleau.”
to men who had risked their lives for him, and besides had done him a great service?”
“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”
A Summer Ball Chapter 69.
“‘Yes, captain,’ returned Carlini.
Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Château-Renaud, and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort’s carriage.
They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound.
“Himself, Monsieur Bernouin.”
“Good,” thought Gondy, “she is going to yield.”
“Hullo,” said Albert; “it is Monte Cristo and his Greek!”
In a very few minutes the count reached No.
The servant then approached Athos and said, hesitatingly:
“‘Oh, that’s no matter,’ replied Caderousse, ‘I will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000 francs.’
A VISION
D’Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge.
Often, before his captivity, Dantès’ mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers.
“Oh, the wickedness of man is very great,” said Villefort, “since it surpasses the goodness of God.
Look at the writing, and find if you can, any blemish in the language or orthography.” The writing was, in reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.
“The chest no longer there?” murmured Madame Danglars, choking with fear.
Bonaparte——”
Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès.
“No, no!
“Do you know who carried off your wife?”
Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort.
Thank you!”
“There was, above all, one room,” continued Monte Cristo, “very plain in appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to me quite dramatic.”
“No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.”
Bonacieux; “and your regiment, your captain?”
“Thank you!” cried he, throwing himself on his horse.
Fortunately, he fancied that Dantès was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table, he withdrew.
As to what may lie before us, it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought.
Grimaud obeyed.
But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.
Athos and Aramis followed him.
He was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even Louis XIII.
A burst of laughter was the answer, but finished with a groan.
The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in his grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall.
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter.
“Well?”
“In the Corso.”
nothing but bitter recollections.”
I saw you were unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that’s all; but since you believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the affair as best you may;” and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.
“Notwithstanding your father’s wishes to the contrary?” said Madame de Villefort, selecting a new point of attack.
Perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king, and who, learning that the king was about to flee and escape him, threw himself in the way, with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand, not as substitute for the executioner, but as an ambassador of Fate.”
Now, allowing for contrary winds, accidents, and a woman’s weakness, there are twelve days.”
“Monsieur,” replied Bertuccio, “it leads to the garden.”
He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.
“D’Artagnan and Porthos.”
“On what I could get.”
“Because she had been branded,” continued D’Artagnan.
Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
“Well, then?” asked Athos, in a low tone.
I hate this life of the fashionable world, always ordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper.
“My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty.
“May I ask how much he allows the young man?”
“He is accused,” said the commissary with his inflexible voice, “of having assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the Count of Monte Cristo.”
One doesn’t hit the bull’s-eye every time; it is something to hit inside the ring.
“There it is, my lord,” said the young man.
“You are the offended party, count.”
“Poor humanity!” murmured Monte Cristo.
The two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristo’s table and that of Signor Pastrini.
“Exactly so,” cried Aramis.
What will it signify if one, two, or three more are added?
To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power.
The carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in a court large, dark, and square.
“Upon our lackey’s horses, _pardieu_.
30123m
Stop there, madame, for this cannot last.
And then, sir, do you wish me to speak freely to you?” continued D’Artagnan, with his frank expression.
Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning.
He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine.
The noiseless door again turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.
“The Abbé Busoni!” exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he let fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied.
“Athos is right—you have my adoration,” said Aramis, in his turn pressing his hand.
D’Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but D’Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot upon it.
At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man.
What possessions, what reputation, what ‘pull,’ as Beauchamp says,—have I?
The two friends made an appointment for ten o’clock on the following day; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel, Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone.
“Oh, father, father!” murmured she, “courage!”
“Exactly.”
“Do you call that nourishment?” said Blaisois, pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table.
“You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,” continued Faria.
I understand.”
“I know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel.
“The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Condé, although I must add ’tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs.”
“It seems to me,” said D’Artagnan, “with a thousand livres each—I do not speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator—”
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable.
“What need you fear?” said Athos, recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced, by the aid of reason; “are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves?
Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before a mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a looking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him.
D’Artagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses; they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him.
I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the sound of your voice.”
There is but one person, or rather, one cause, to whom a man like me can be useful—that of the king.”
“No.”
But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate.
The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him.
Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left, and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation—he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness.
I can answer positively on that point, for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon, the substitute for Monsieur d’Artagnan, still holds his place.”
He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in M. Morrel’s salon.
“What are you doing?”
It was about eleven o’clock at night.
“What do you intend doing with me?”
At this sight the young man stopped short, not in admiration of Raphael’s picture, but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object.
The bell of Monte Citorio, which only sounds on the pope’s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was ringing a joyous peal.
“Hold your tongue!
Villefort retired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who is expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild.
When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her.
He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were guilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed.
With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,—all became a dream for Franz.
“And you, my dear companion,” said he, “you speak of the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?”
But to Dantès’ eye there was no darkness.
His name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal.
What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God?”
An instant after, Bazin made his appearance at the door.
“Yes, dear friend,” Athos replied, “but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable—it was noble and generous.
She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Athos.
“Friend,” said Athos, gravely, “remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth.
“Yes, count, it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you, but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man.
M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself in about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.
“Your majesty has given me the control of this business; we had better wait and see what they want.”
The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal; and four-and-twenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution.
“As to that,” said Athos, “I beg you to believe that I care very little about it.
All these proofs of an energetic resolution, which Albert did not fear on his own account, alarmed him for his mother.
“Marie Michon!” said Madame de Chevreuse, hastily.
“Be satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.
Bonacieux, raising her hands to her forehead, “I shall go mad!”
Henceforth, Valentine, you will never again be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find you.
“Explain yourself.”
“This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,” said Château-Renaud, “although my mother has some remarkable family jewels.”
“There is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar.”
Living, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your head and say, ‘I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first time, he has been compelled to break his word.’”
“_Ma foi!_” said Louis XVIII., “take it, such as it is, for I have not the time to procure you another.
“From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary.
“Were you pleased with Paris, sir?”
Aramis calmly drew his sword, which he had carried between his teeth as he swam.
And she took two or three steps forward.
“Well”, said Caderousse, “why don’t you come?
will you let me be killed?
But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?”
Reflect upon it.”
“Go on, monsieur.
And he drew nearer to her.
This time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the garrison.
D’Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.
All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.
“Why should I do that?”
These bitter-sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes, sometimes longer, but always finished thus:
Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and sat down close beside her.
He descended, or rather seemed to descend, several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular host, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of statues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.
If so, I will give you a letter of introduction to him.’
The commission might well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.
“Your engagement was for breakfast, then?” said the count.
The first row, seeing their sergeant stop, stopped in their turn, and so on to the very last.
“I hope so.”
We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being taken—when St. Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the _halali_—crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two-year-older.
“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”
“‘Let me see this diamond again,’ replied the jeweller; ‘the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone.’
The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea appeared quite unmoved.
“Directly.”
“We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting out of your carriage; we are supposed not to know each other.”
“Here it is,” replied Aramis.
“You will know that to-morrow evening,” said the coadjutor, smiling.
“Without doubt.”
“Sir,” said Franz, “I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never inquired the amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds mine.
“I?” replied Eugénie with her usual candor.
“There are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master,” cried the young emulator of the furious Tréville.
“Ah!
He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth, D’Artagnan’s confidence stopped there.
Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of Villefort trembled.
“Just under us.”
“Whom do you mean by they?”
“Yes, a base coward,” murmured D’Artagnan; “but she—she was very beautiful.”
“Besides,” said Athos, waiting till D’Artagnan, who went to thank Monsieur de Tréville, had shut the door, “besides, there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend.
“Well, if you die,” said she, “bequeath your fortune to others, for if you die I shall require nothing;” and, taking the paper, she tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room.
The rabbit died.
Cries of “Death!
“Oh, no,” said Morrel; “my sister is five-and-twenty, my brother-in-law is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy.
Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is still more enchanted with another.
And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.
“A visitor?” inquired Valentine, much agitated; “who is it?”
There he had a chair made on his own plan, and one day, visiting Anne of Austria in this chair, she asked him, charmed as she was with his wit, if he did not wish for a title.
“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred to all others if once known.
Will they not sign it?”
The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents relative to the Château d’If, giving him all the time he desired for the examination, while De Boville seated himself in a corner, and began to read his newspaper.
The three friends were likewise greatly delighted.
His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled.
Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone; “that imbecile lacked but one thing: to become a cardinalist.
“What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?”
At first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not resist his love of sport, and set out after dinner.”
“I shall soon return,” said the banker to Monte Cristo; “wait for me.
At length he advanced toward the group, the meaning of which he could not comprehend.
At this sigh Felton turned round.
“The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,” replied Franz.
The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him—a cry of admiration burst from every mouth.
“To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte, the queen’s _valet de chambre_.”
“Sir,” said De Guiche to his tutor, “we will precede you, and you can rejoin us on the road to Cambrin.”
Milady looked around her, as if in search of something.
“Who can tell?
The duke’s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world, but one of the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money.
“And grandpapa has become my physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.”
“Well, my husband would never live in it.”
He was quite alone; on one side was the vast wilderness of the Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris enshrouded in darkness.
“No, with the baron.”
“But where is such a lackey to be found?”
“Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency’s wish,” said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; “I have caused one to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.”
“Good; what o’clock is it?”
Albert rose to return to his place.
“Ah,” interrupted Morcerf, laughing, “Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that for the _Corsaire_ or the _Charivari_, but spare my future father-in-law before me.” Then, turning to Monte Cristo, “You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron?”
Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance, and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril.
“My good dame,” asked D’Artagnan, “can you tell me what has become of one of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago?”
“Decidedly, my dear Athos,” said D’Artagnan, “I should like better not to risk anything.”
“Are they both dead?” asked Lord de Winter, sternly.
Never!” said D’Artagnan.
“Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his mind.
on!” cried D’Artagnan; “there’ll be firing!
“And yet that villain, Benedetto, will escape!”
The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony.
“As I told you, everything can be attained, Porthos, women and doors, by proceeding with gentleness.”
I tell you that you know these things as well as I do, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a friend.”
“Do you know, my dear fellow, why master pastrycooks never work with their hands?”
Chapter 106.
de Saint-Méran had always expressed a desire, in case his death happened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought to the family vault.
“What are their names?”
“Yes,” said Danglars, “but I confess I didn’t quite comprehend its meaning.”
“Ho!
“Pray, sir, explain yourself,” said Villefort, more and more astonished, “I really do—not—understand you—perfectly.”
What would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men?”
So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant handkerchief, and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the period—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.
“Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere,” said D’Artagnan; “for the count must be furious.”
Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine, even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop.” His manner became more and more lofty every instant; then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was.
Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel.”
“True, monsieur le comte,” replied D’Artagnan, who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him.
Athos sprang up, but after an instant of motionless silence he said, to the astonishment of his friends, “Monsieur Mordaunt, a duel between us is impossible.
“How have I deceived you?”
“There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself,” said he.
If you go accompanied by any other person, or should anyone else go in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it.”
D’Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet without reply.
He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner, close to La Ramee’s heart, that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination.
“I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,” replied Eugénie.
Have you anything?”
And remember my life depends on your answer.
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance; but his father, a sun _pluribus impar_, left his personal splendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his courtiers.
Then he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought; but nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised.
The Ambassadors.
Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina.
“Fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!” said Peppino in Italian, and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place.
It was said Athos had met with great crosses in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man.
Look,” added he.
“And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune?
“Well, and if he were to lose them?” said Monte Cristo.
“I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.”

“Now, then, to breakfast,” said Beauchamp; “for, if I remember, you told me you only expected two persons, Albert.”
Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d’Angoulême, by Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Ré, where they still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée, as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle.

I hate you, and on my word you shall pay for this!”
“With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,” continued Danglars, “you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade.
If you do, you know that my hand stretches far, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me.”
mon Dieu!
“It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love.”

One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the next, so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.

His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors,—songs so clear and sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down,—he saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the desert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build a city.

As for you, illustrious descendant of William Tell, you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me, and go out quickly to another lodging.”
Milady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes when he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the expression of his face; if he seemed very amorous.
Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls, I believe, but very common among men.”
“Valentine,” said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, “give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused, and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain.

We will try and carry him on board the tartan.”
“Set your mind at rest,” replied Athos.
Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle.
“Well, sir,” said the queen, “what is your opinion of this riot?”
Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this, but did not recognize him.

The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon; then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment.
“The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does it not?” asked Caderousse.
Allow me, then, if you please, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.”
Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have his labor for his pains.
“You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.”

1.F.1.
“Ah, sir,” said Caderousse with a sigh, “it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest.” The abbé fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.
But, once started, he could not stop.

This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830.
“But tell me now, count,” exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo; “tell me truly whether you are in earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?”
Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge.
Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristo’s door.
But so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe.
They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aramis.
“Never mind; let’s sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night.”
“Well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,” said D’Artagnan.
“Did you know me better,” returned the count, smiling, “you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla podrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and swallows’ nests in China.

In a moment he had passed through them, and could see the house distinctly.
“How is it all the better?”
I know nothing about it.”
Who knows?
They found the carriage where they had left it.
What are you looking at there?
So much the better for me, sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness—for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am ruining myself by speaking the truth.

You talk of sacrilege!
They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they ought to have been.

She had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour; but Felton did not come.
Athos, who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts, took his arm and led him into the garden.

“Yourself.”
“That alters the case.
“And what will you do in that case?”
“See, the prince is pluming himself,” said one of the thieves.
“‘“Sir,” said the president, rising with gravity, “be careful what you say; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba, and have deceived us!
All the rest of the square was paved with heads.
“Well done!” said the Englishman.

From whom comes this letter?”

“Money.”
“Although,” said Villefort, “it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfather’s fortune, I do not think that M. d’Épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss.
“Do you possess that right over Bertuccio?”
The major will bring his son with him this evening, the _contino_, as we say in Italy; he confides him to my care.
“Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo knows everybody.”
I want to carry off my son from them, with yourself.

The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.
Where are your passports?”
28.
The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find.

“But,” observed the honest notary, “the count is, I think, mistaken; it is only fifty thousand francs, everything included.”
The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known.
In fact, it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far.
The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.
“Which?”
You are Madame’s brother, I learn—be it so; but fortunately you are not mine.”
Why did you not come down to breakfast?
“The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers.”
“And, my faith, the governor of the province—one of the gentlemen I expected today—seemed to have such a wish for him, that I gave him to him.”
He had passed the night standing, and without sleep.
“No, it has been stolen from you.”
Let us get down, count, and examine this rock.”
Bernouin, seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight, had made an examination of the orangery.
“Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years.”
Monte Cristo bowed, and left the house.
“‘“Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?”
“You see my position, madame,” said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile on Monte Cristo.
Mordaunt, pale and trembling with anger, rushed from the hall sword in hand, followed by six pikemen, pushing, inquiring and panting in the crowd; and then, having found nothing, returned.
I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message.
“You have never seen our Africans, count?” said Albert.
If, on the contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will cease, and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep.”
“Never fear, King Charles,” said Mordaunt, “the bullet pierced his heart.”
It was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned, for as soon as D’Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady were visible, one of them ran to announce him.
The countenance of this man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings, expressed the most perfect cordiality.
“M.
It was chance that threw me in your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends.”
“Where?”
“Father, I will,” said Maximilian.
This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will.
It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.”
“I swear it.”
The young man appeared on the threshold of the minister’s closet, in one hand holding his hat, in the other the letter.
He lodges at the Hôtel des Princes.
“I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man.”
“Ah, you knew that?” said Mordaunt.
The names of all, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio.
Oh, the train is well laid; the plot is clever.
The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed; the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps.
“I will do my best.”
“Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,” said she with feverish volubility; “I don’t know my way.
“That’s true,” said Kitty; “your son was the only heir of his uncle, and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune.”
“No, no,” said he.
“It is too long a time.
“Listen, Rochefort; let us make a compact.
There are the horses.
“If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape), will you leave him in prison?”
“You are wounded?” asked Buckingham, as he opened the letter.
In the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny, whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him.
“You acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?”
“Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight, but thoroughly awake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.”
Albert and Franz looked at each other, fearing really to abuse the count’s kindness.
“Then, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody must be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in his mother’s jewel case.”
Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
I have no influence with any one.
“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.”
“Certainly, we are friends,” he replied; “why should we not be?”
Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcerf.
“Indeed, they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the Bastille.”
“Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning over again.
“Ah, count,” said Albert, “I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them, for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.”
Aramis shook his head.
He was told that twenty citizens, headed by one man, had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal’s bodyguard; but a reinforcement having come up, the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings; the house was now being searched.
“You were right, my Lord,” said Felton, with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, “you were right, my Lord, and I was wrong.”
Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our Chimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans.
“Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the word) at M. de Villefort’s is that there is an assassin in the house!”
“And is it your cook who prepares these pills?” asked Beauchamp.
The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his side—not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria.
Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality.”
Albert was not deceived, for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner.
“What do I think?” said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question from his companion; “I think he is a delightful fellow, who does the honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is, like Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,” added he, sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, “that he has excellent cigars.”
Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear.
I tremble to give my permission.”
I will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself.”
He told me to watch you.”
Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints against your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this evening his Eminence is indisposed?
“And it was a fierce one?”
“How so?” inquired the abbé.
The procureur then told his wife to come up.
However proud you may be, you will not refuse to accept one of them, and to request your three companions to accept the others—that is, in order to make war against us.
“With the enmity of the government.”
“Horror!” cried D’Artagnan.
20035m
“Till then, God preserve your Majesty!”
“Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take the trouble of recopying it.
D’Artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it.
Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and pressing the hand of D’Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, “well: I will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be lost forever.
“Well, I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes, and that we shall see each other every day.”
“Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where he is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.”
The blush of pride mounted to the count’s forehead as this thought passed through his mind.
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then with a cord over the handkerchief.
Ah, if I knew!
At that moment D’Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a passing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.
“Ah, my dear friend!” he cried, “what bad stabling for my horses here.”
The witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he had not struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise.
“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.
Oh, if she betrayed your Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be quite another thing, and I should be the first to say, ‘No grace, sire—no grace for the guilty!’ Happily, there is nothing of the kind, and your Majesty has just acquired a new proof of it.”
She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and arrived at Boulogne without accident.
“Of what consequence?
How could I, then, return to Brussels?
I know you now.
All these women had been, or were, beautiful.
“Yes, brigadier.”
“Hear me, Maximilian,” said his father.
his health—hurrah!”
Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done so when he parted from Mercédès.
The musketeer, thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise, bowed, and drawing his sword, signified that he was ready.
“Let him be sent for instantly.”
“Now,” said the Gascon, “that is all well, I accept for Porthos and myself everything—thanks and compliments; we have plenty of time to spare.”
“As I was weeping and begging on the high road, a minister from Kingston took me in, instructed me in the Calvinistic faith, taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family.”
“There is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this woman is one of the cardinal’s spies, I am sure of that.”
“Willingly,” said the cardinal; “I will even ask the count to keep it for my sake.”
“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.
“That is possible,” said the countess, reflecting.
It was Porthos.
Asmodeus—that diabolical personage, who would have been created by every fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece—would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue Saint-Germain-des-Prés, while Debray was casting up his figures.
he will let you into the rooms in his tower,” said the curate.
He then turned to the left, down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends, but as he opened the door he paused, as if in thought.
“Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise was completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.”
Are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and the Rue Saint Antoine?”
“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”
“Poor Eugénie!” said Danglars; “do you know she is going to embrace a religious life?”
“Yes, the porter.”
What do you say?
“Well,” said Franz with a sigh, “do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.
“Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.”
“Oh,” cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, “what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?”

She must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal.
“Now we are getting on.
Before the door the traces were yet more apparent; these horsemen, whoever they might be, had halted there.
By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades.
The parents of little La Valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it; now they begin to look concerned.”
“Summer balls are fashionable.”
“Adieu, then, until five o’clock; be punctual, and we shall arrive at twelve or one.”
“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.
Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal.
Your letter has frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.”
“Yes—here we are,” said Porthos.
It was a tolerably fine winter’s day, and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.
And now, your excellency,” he added, bowing his head, “you know everything—you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?”
“You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell into his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me, recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a present of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.”
Lead me to him.”
Bonacieux, “so much happiness is not in store for me!”
This Frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes, that she could not doubt their influence even over Monsieur de Condé; and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified.
The queen, who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort than the cardinal himself, and who was almost as superstitious as he was, made him repeat word for word all La Ramee’s praises of his deputy.
“This mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you will be very glad to see him.”
“I am a Frondist from my heart.
Villefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace.
“Well, then, we shall go down into the court.”
You have done this—I hope so, at least.”
“Not yet.” said Aramis; “we have still a word to say to these gentlemen.”
The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and D’Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.
“Well, that is scarcely the question.
He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost.
Do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us?
You were among the first who tasted any of my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.” While speaking, Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.
“To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarin—the freshest news there is.”
“Planchet,” called out D’Artagnan, “take care of the lackey; I will manage the master.”
A transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister; he looked at the queen with anxiety.
“I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me.”
D’Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full length, and listened.
But we have not as yet declared war; perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions, therefore a solemn conference is indispensable.”
I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense of my danger.
Make inquiry.”
You wish to ask for liberty, and—I give it you.”
“I thought so, madame,” stammered the young girl.
May you not have been philandering a little also, Monsieur Bonacieux?
The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,—an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the place the appellation of _The Little Versailles_.
“You are not, then, a man of the people?” said Mazarin, astonished.
An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles.
Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.
“Yes, and I hear in bitter poverty.
Then, accustomed to passive obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at the end of twenty paces met D’Artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming to him.
Then, infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the inspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.
1.E.7.
The poor duke became perfectly giddy.
“I thank you, sir,” replied the prisoner, humbly.
besides, if they do, we can easily make an excuse; we came straight off a journey and are insurgents, too.”
Bonacieux’s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness.
“Silence!
Those wretches wanted to take away my sword!
Would you like to know how matters have progressed?
“That, you may be sure,” said the Gascon, “means something.”
“I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I have not lost sight of you.”
The House of Morrel & Son
“Why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?”
“I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me.
“Now,” said D’Artagnan, “I am going to call this soldier and talk to him.
“You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened?”
“No, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.”
“Is our little neighbor worse?” asked D’Artagnan, seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth.
Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on.
“I am he.”
The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades, and I have heard nothing of either of them since.
“You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.”
“Nay,” said Caderousse, “one can’t always work—one is not a dog.”
Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner.
But he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned; his haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some terrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections.
Beyond that hedge, that garden, and that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where Paris slept—a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points, the funeral stars of that hell!
“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his head, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”
It will be remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination.
“If your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy.”
“That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person.”
Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him, Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces.
“The cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.”
Raoul, on foot, for he had not time to mount his horse again, tired, like the guards, of distributing blows with the flat of his sword, had recourse to its point.
Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase.
He took his fowling-piece, and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids.
This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence on the part of the locksmith.
Then Dantès departed for Genoa.
“Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so—in the left side, and with a knife.
“Yes, true,” replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, “I remember now.”
“Nothing,” replied Milady.
“Have you, sir,” asked he, “a letter accrediting you to me?”
“Alas,” said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.
You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents, or what evil ways all these men of the church have, with whom I am obliged to live.
“Then the news I brought you is of value?”
A bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one corner.
“No,” said Felton, “it is nothing.”
“Impossible!
Although La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might appear—thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke, which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city—the blockade might last a long time yet.
“What was it then?”
“I shall have the order signed directly, sir, and with it two thousand pistoles; meanwhile, let me take these men away.”
“And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against your son?”
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain D’Artagnan, constantly in advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which in an instant he again departed from.
“No; the letter.”
“Is she there, Grimaud?” asked Athos.
“I would follow him to hell, and that is saying not a little, as I believe him entirely capable of the descent.”
“How so?”
Put your names into a hat and draw lots.”
For people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.
“These names are too numerous for me to remember them all, and I will content myself with the first,” said the queen, graciously.
“Yes, my lord, my mother,” replied the young man, advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter, and crossing his arms.
A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.
“Yes, they would have all been blown up.”
A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and joined the Musketeers.
“Don’t be uneasy on that score,” replied Villefort; “no ceremony will be neglected in my house.
D’Artagnan quietly pushed him in again, and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one, keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunt’s hands, who, however, knowing that it was useless, attempted no resistance.
The cardinal writes better than I thought.
The next morning he left that inn as he had left the Hôtel des Princes, without being noticed, walked down the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Ménilmontant, and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter’s absence.
The true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door, and even the second was passed easily enough; but at the third watched, besides the guard and the doorkeepers, the faithful Bernouin, a Cerberus whom no speech could soften, no wand, even of gold, could charm.
“Too ardently, perhaps; it is what I have just reproached you for.
If not, I will apply to the chancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I will move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I will bring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith of a gentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would a mad dog.’”
Those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames.
1.F.1.
But you guess it now, do you not?—or, rather, you remember it?
Besides, Maximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence over his father.
For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears, and I chose the latter; at any rate, it is a French word.
“If it should even compromise me a little,” said Monsieur de Comminges, with a smile, “still make your demand.
Athos, again struck by this name, which seemed to pursue him like an echo, hesitated for a moment, then slightly knitting his brows, he calmly said:
“M.
You have not played for a long time, D’Artagnan.”
“Please to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and M. Franz d’Épinay.
“Oh, what is the matter?” cried Dantès.
She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she would have seduced a saint.
“Therefore, whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf——”
She suited me in every respect, and I would have married her.”
“I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity, allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends.”
“No,” cried D’Artagnan, “no steel.
“Yes.
D’Artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but could not find Planchet in any of them.
The Suicide Chapter 93.
“‘Ah,’ said he.
“Yes, if your majesty releases them.”
“Dost thou know Noisy well?”
“I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?” Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man.
“‘The Abbé Busoni,’ said La Carconte.
“Patience!” said Athos; “I had a plan.
“Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness.”
“He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.”
The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his adherents.
Are you a doctor?”
The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was, and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream, but the sound died in her throat.
“I am a victim of the cardinal.
“You arrive in good time, monsieur,” said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a certain point, could not dissemble; “I have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers.”
There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the young man, that Milady felt reassured.
Villefort’s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and Franz was stupefied.
Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them.
“No,” interrupted Mercédès, “but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son.”
Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou, within two steps of the Luxembourg.
He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and he is disfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be pardoned.
“It is to be found for the searching.
“What has become of her, then?” asked Rochefort, eagerly.
Dantès, your health.”
But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything.”
Give me anything you like, it is of little consequence.”
“Neffer,” replied the Swiss, enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him anything.
“My friends,” said Parry, mounting the scaffold and standing beside them, “would you work a little more quietly?
I told you Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything, even his father.”
“Dear Benedetto,” said he, “I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend.”
Perhaps you will think, sir, that prosperity has spoiled me?”
“Oh, you need not avow this religious indifference, my Lord; your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it.”
“He—he—incur danger of death!
“Sixty.”
A rapid change took place in the young man’s feelings.
“Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said; but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have doubts.”
“Ah!
“He is calling you,” said the count; “he to whom you have confided your destiny—he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.
Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to no determination, and as nothing in the count’s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past, or wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum.
“Charge!” cried Porthos.
Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow, as he would have done to a young daughter.
“Ah, my dear sir!
“Well,” said Dantès, “mark this; if you refuse at least to tell Mercédès I am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool.”
If you go on so, his Eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks, and I to put the edicts in force in all their rigor.
He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking between the Château d’If and the tower of Planier.
“Ah, it is certainly you!” he cried.
No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he said:
Yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman.
Adieu!
I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and I say that it is horrible!”
I believed you dead; why did I survive you?
At the corner of the street they met the count’s steward, who was awaiting his master.
Why, people jest with death.”
It is you who have come to me.
The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber.
“Your father was fortunate, then?” said he.
“Oh, well,” said the count, “I do not think you have yet known the want of money.”
“And do you,” said Valentine, “depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa?”
“I, too,” said Porthos, who, faithful to the instructions, still held the cardinal’s arm.
“You are mistaken; it is because he has a wife and family, and ambitious desires for himself and them.
Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable boys had beaten him.
“And then,” said Aramis, with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God, “what is the use of thinking of it all?
Where am I, and why am I here?
if he troubles me too much I will crush him, the insect!
“But one.”
Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath.
“I will say,” continued the count, “that he followed and watched you the whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself.”
“M.

“No.”
“Mercédès?” said the old man.
“The devil!
Speak, I am ready to obey.”
“And has the unfortunate man wife or children?” inquired the abbé.

“Ah, come in, come in, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the cardinal, “and welcome your friend too.
When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously.
And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin.
Fortunately we have the great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart.”
There was nothing but felicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais.
“He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,” muttered the count.
“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his.
He thought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated.
“To me she seems overloaded,” observed Eugénie; “she would look far better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists.”
And now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the masters and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them.
He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire.
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk.”
What would your excellency like?”
You would love me as much if I were poor, would you not, Maximilian?”
“It does not signify, gentlemen,” continued the cardinal, without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started, “it does not signify, gentlemen.
Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp.
“Hush, the curtain is rising.
Why, there is nothing improper in our conversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it.”
“Will they never bring that emetic?” asked the doctor.
“Yes.”
“It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my thoughts,” said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.
“Well, now tell your story, Penelon.”
_Ma foi_, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.”
And then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead against the fence.
Towards the evening of the third day.
“My good friend,” said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre, “you seem determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please.”
Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort’s bedroom.
And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may have sent the letter itself!

“That of either our friends or our enemies,” said Milady, with her terrible coolness.
“And I can well understand,” said the countess, shrugging up her beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins, “that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him.”
He watched the effect of this question on the old man.
He converted his chamber into an observatory.
My life belongs to my cash.
You cannot be mistaken; there is but one.”
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow, while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.
“Well?” asked the young girl, with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before, and which startled him.
Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor, when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself, travel-stained, dirty, and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner.
He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage.
“Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?”
You have insulted a defenseless man.
He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived.
Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter:
According to the laws of dueling at that period, D’Artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased.
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step.
“And,” said Villefort, “is it at your house in the Champs-Élysées that you receive your visitors?”
Mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him and said:
“My son!” he exclaimed suddenly, “where is my son?—Edward, Edward!” and he rushed out of the room, still crying, “Edward, Edward!” The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up.
You are about to become captain at nineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone.”
“And you assisted and took part in this great battle, Bragelonne!” cried the former musketeer.
They seemed awaiting orders.
Noirtier?
“Buckingham?”
“Do you know then now what you are?”
“There is a Providence; there is a God,” said Monte Cristo, “of whom you are a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair, denying him, while I stand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating that God in whom you endeavor not to believe, while in your heart you still believe in him.”
“Under any circumstances,” he resumed, “you are welcome, my dear friend; you will help me to recover my spirits; to-morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain, which is a superb tract of land, or pursue the deer in my woods, which are magnificent.
“Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.”
“The one you bought will then become useless to you?”
Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Tréville and the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes, after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from the lawyer’s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less with Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.
“It is absurd,” said Debray.
On the doorsteps d’Avrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied—one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others.
“But delay may ruin our plan, sir,” replied the young man.
“Be satisfied, beautiful Constance.
In the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance, the duchess seemed to be looking for some one; at last she found out Raoul and her eyes sparkled; she perceived Athos and became thoughtful; she saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan.
and the man?”
just so.
“Exactly so.”
At the word _Notary_, Noirtier made a sign to her to stop.
What, then, have I to fear from him?”
“What do you think of all this?” said Athos, in a low tone to D’Artagnan, after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in English.
A small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If.
“Where are you going?” cried the young girl, extending her hand through the opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover’s calmness could not be real; “where are you going?”
I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you.
“I have read so in Petronius,” said the count.
Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen?”
“You should furnish him with some of course,” replied Monte Cristo.
Andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him.
Raoul really felt tired, but he was desirous of testing his strength, and, brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty-five leagues, he did not wish to fall far short of his model.
He pushed on toward him, but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley, into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it.
Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him; and one day after dinner he went to bed, calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned him.
Milady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.
Porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator’s wife in the cloister of St. Magloire.

“And how did the thing happen?
Oh, I assure you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures, destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three.
It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin, whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed.

“Very possibly.”
“And we shall answer?”

“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.
“Indeed.”
Athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking.
In fact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened; but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down.
But you come from England.
“Boulevard de l’Opéra,” said Beauchamp; “the second floor—a house with a balcony.
“Yes, gentlemen, the king in person, the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened.”
Gentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards.”
Felton entered.
“Here?

yes, of course, Mouston; nothing else.
“Those are all?” asked Grimaud.
Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison?”
I neither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action.
Athos!” cried Aramis, with an emotion very rare in him.
Bonacieux.
Guémené was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary, desired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to listen, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.
Tell me his name, and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Backson.
“In the cellar.”
“She can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had, indeed, the misfortune to——”
Hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them, and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them.
“But, oh, how I passed that time!
Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?”
“You’re right; yes, let us go.”
With the queen I double her risk; after the queen her departure would double mine; then, the court once safe, I might be forgotten.
Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness.
And besides, even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time; it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle.
“I say I am entirely of Porthos’s opinion,” replied Aramis.
“But wait a minute,” said M. de Tréville, stopping him.
“It is not Aramis!” cried he.
Your guest is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes.
Oh, no, he was afraid to encounter him face to face.”
This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it had been added since his confinement.
They pitied the young king, who was unconsciously ruining his country, and threw all the odium of his proceedings on Mazarin.
“Monsieur,” said Athos, letting him go, “you are not polite; it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance.”
The interview for which I ask is of us two alone, and I very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted.”
“What is that line?” cried Athos, whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi-tints of daybreak.
“Day for day, hour for hour,” said Albert; “that will suit me to a dot.”
“‘Not another step,’ he said, ‘or you are a dead man.’

The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by d’Avrigny.
Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the brief narrative.
“This vexes you?” said Athos.
“That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy one.”
But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could distinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed.
“And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?”
The Duke saluted and retired.
“Carlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak, and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest.
“At ten in the evening, if that suits you; by that time we shall have returned.”
“To wait,” replied Athos.

“Adieu, sir,” she said.
I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”
“Monseigneur, I swear to you that I never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you.
“And do you know,” said Valentine, “what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house.” Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence, but she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for Morrel.
The major looked anxiously around him.
if I had not the hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husband’s chest!”
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned, and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted.
The four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.
“And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for you.
When once I know the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over this fence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in which you will accompany me to my sister’s; there living, retired or mingling in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep, which only defend themselves by sighs.”
Acknowledge it, Beauchamp; your courage cannot be doubted.”
“I never like upstarts.”
Lord de Winter went out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting the door after him.

“You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?”
“See,” said the count, “how very ungrateful women are.
“It is unnecessary for you to understand.
“If you wish it, my son,” said the major; and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each rested his head on the other’s shoulder.
“What!” said he, “you have just lost one woman, whom you call good, charming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.”
After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos.
As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments.
He hastened to open the _secrétaire_, and found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter of credit.
“Sir, you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever received.
“By Heaven and earth!
Some of these boats were dark and mysterious, others noisy and lighted up with torches.
Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase.
As for myself, I neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect the very judicious example of Athos, who has none any more than I have.”

In the name of that young lady you love, and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!” cried the bandit, throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand—for he began to lose his strength with his blood.
He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin; he will consider us as brothers.
Monte Cristo bent his head.
The bird on the branch, the dog in his kennel, the sheep in the field, the boats moored in the Loire, even, became alive and vocal.
Villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto death, gnashing his teeth in his wound.
Come!
“It seems, sir steward,” said he, “that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price.”
Loose, half-drunk, imposing, the king’s Musketeers, or rather M. de Tréville’s, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public walks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches, clanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing in the open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports; sometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged; often killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de Tréville being there to claim them.
“But my purse will be exhausted.”

“Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!”
“Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall I tell you the cause of all these stupidities?
Supposing it had been thrown aside, it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this examination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.”
Is being in love conspiring?
Emmanuel, go with them, and see that my orders are executed.”
Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so.
“I was not aware of it,” replied Albert, “but I can readily believe it.”
“It is true; but in everything, friend, one must always return to the same question—a stupid one, I admit, but very necessary—have you any money?”
We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort.
“Alas!
We take him to the other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at Bourges.”
Albert sprang from the porter’s lodge to the steps.
“Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.”
I never was romantic, and am no melancholy hero.
“One moment,” said the prisoner, in French.
Bonacieux.
I pretended to pour out water from the jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass.
“Do you wish anything?”
Finally, the prince led the right wing, resting on Aunay.

They have selected a field of battle on which I am an abler general than they—that of a conference.
D’Artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way, and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Athos.
The prince smiled; he despised flatterers, but he appreciated enthusiasts.
Then, as we have said, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier.
What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall?
But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her, Mme.
Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you, existence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream.
“And what misfortune could happen to me?
“Ah, things go on gaily, then,” said Porthos.
The three friends hastened on, but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace.
“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”
As soon as she was seated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet.
“That happens just lucky, your excellency!
“To be sure!—to be sure!” cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table; “let us go directly!”
I know, because it is my office to know everything.
If it is God’s justice, instead of his anger, which is walking through that house, Maximilian, turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose.”
“Yes, my Lord, I accept them,” said D’Artagnan; “and if it please God, we will make a good use of your presents.”
They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries.
“You have guessed rightly, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling; “in a week I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit the vengeance of Heaven lived happily, while my father perished of hunger and grief.”
The hostess, who knew D’Artagnan’s skill with the sword, began to weep and tear her hair.
“I know it will serve me as it did when we came over.”
“You are late.”
“I know it,” said Château-Renaud; “I narrowly escaped catching a fever there.”
“However,” replied the abbé, with an affable smile, “when that report is in accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police as well as all the rest.”
No, I grieve not on my own account, I shall always find a resource; my books, my pencils, my piano, all the things which cost but little, and which I shall be able to procure, will remain my own.
Aramis obeyed.
“This Rochefort,” cried Porthos, “if I were the esquire of poor Chalais, should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me.”
“And that is situated?”
Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment, and Peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel, after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter, who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol at his fullest speed.
“They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow.
The soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward.
“What do I see in it?”
The two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one another.
The young officer preserved silence.
“You will, by and by,” said Debray.
“You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each other.”
Then the cardinal put out the waxlight, slipped it into his pocket, and taking up the lantern: “Now,” he said, “for Monsieur de la Fere.”
tell them to order Number 25 to come downstairs.”
“Exactly; but that is not all.
“You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan, with chagrin.
“Oh,” said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable.
As little sensitive as was the heart of D’Artagnan, he was touched by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his projects, above all to this one, to change the program which he had laid out in advance.
Some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt.”
“Yes and no.”
Sit down, my dear friend, and let us talk.” And Aramis pushed forward a large easy-chair, in which D’Artagnan stretched himself out.
“And for pirates?”
“No, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I bought it with the contents of my own purse,” answered he whom they designated by the name Porthos.
The baroness took advantage of her husband’s absence to push open the door of her daughter’s study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugénie, started up like a jack-in-the-box.
“No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no matter, I can fancy it.” And he shouted with laughter.
When he was quite a child, and only a shepherd, I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he, in order to repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of arms.
“Your blessing, your holiness, before you go, I beseech you!” he cried.
“Yes,” said Porthos; “my air is excellent.”
Both men entered Monte Cristo’s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No.
“First and foremost, dear D’Artagnan, we have no title such as count here.
“The traitor!” murmured Mme.
However, he had not ventured thus far to draw back.
“The Abbé d’Herblay,” resumed De Winter, “is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII., of whom I have spoken to you, madame.” Then turning to Athos, he continued, “And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere, whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty.”
“His eminence sent me.”
At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast.
“You are much pleased with yourself,” said he to Raoul when they were alone, “are you not?”
You are right,” cried the affrighted Mme.
This time my determination is irrevocably taken.
“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “it is just as I thought; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d’Épinay into personal contact.
“Not a bad idea!” said Athos, emptying and refilling his glass.
‘I have not enough,’ you said, when you had more than you before possessed, and you committed a third crime, without reason, without excuse.
The Flight.
Let us go and have a game at tennis, La Ramee.”
Athos smiled and opened the window.
“I propose to defend no one but myself, and I shall defend myself vigorously, I give you warning.”
“Stop,” cried Athos, extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted; “you will soon know what to expect, for here he is.”
Do you hear—not a single creature!
Hasten to Monte Cristo—avail yourself of the fortune—for you have indeed suffered long enough.”
what?” asked his friend.
“Perfectly sure.”
But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him.
“Where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council.”
“And the crew?” asked Morrel.
The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before.
“Well, on the faith of a minister.”
“And then I have thought that considering three months’ lodging, about which I have said nothing—”
“Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost make me believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father will curse me—he is inflexible—he will never pardon me.
D’Artagnan mounted the box, having a pair of pistols in his belt, a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.
The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother, was let to a very mysterious person.
Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little terrace commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke’s chamber.
Groslow, on the question being interpreted, answered, “Three, without counting myself.”
She evidently interrogated him by her look.
Grimaud rose.
The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court, receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered, and all the honor due to his rank.
“You are unjust to a great poet, it seems to me,” Raoul ventured to say.
The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself.
Morrel smiled mournfully.
So that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut out from observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain.
From his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught.
As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the anchor to be weighed.
“It is, indeed,” said Danglars.
“Well?” asked Peppino of his friend.
I lost him then, with all his appointments and furniture.”
“Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.”
That cousin of Aramis, that Marie Michon, that needlewoman, notwithstanding her low condition, had acquaintances in the highest rank; she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend, and the queen—proud as she is, in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniard—called her her sister.”
“But at any rate, you know where he is, Monsieur d’Artagnan?” asked Raoul, somewhat comforted.
“Holloa!
“What doest thou here, good-for-nothing?” she said, “and why art thou not at Notre Dame?”
Chapter I.
This pretended D’Artagnan—was he not an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce into Tréville’s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances?
On their way they met Grimaud.
“As long as I live.”

A similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat appeared, rowed by four men.
The Absolution.
Franz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire.
“Ah, you have reflected!” said the prisoner, sitting down in her armchair, with a smile of disdain; “and I also have reflected.”
“What are they?”
“I love you, I?”
“He is a coward, indeed,” grumbled the host, drawing near to D’Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before.
It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not sit still in her seat.

“Simply this,” said the coadjutor.

“A retired baker?” asked the fruiteress.
Then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de Tréville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a Guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.

They stopped him at the door.
“I dare not write to his majesty.”
A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview, and therefore he had suggested it.

The agent of Thomson & French had not been again seen at Marseilles; the day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had disappeared; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor, the inspector of prisons, and M.

If no obstacle occurs we will both charge together, force the enemy’s line and throw ourselves into the Tyne, which we must cross, either by fording or swimming; if, on the contrary, any repulse should take place, you and your men must fight to the last man, whilst we and the king proceed on our road.

He sends me for that purpose, and here I am.”
“He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at home.”
no, madame,” answered De Winter; “but the case is provided for and I am come to France to seek allies.”
“Well?”
“How unfortunate I am!” said she; “I have been here six months without the shadow of recreation.
You have heard what I said?
“I have suffered deeply, madame,” answered Monte Cristo.
“Speak, speak, signora,” said Albert, “I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say.”
“But I have seen them drink it.”
“Yes, a chef d’oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini,” replied Athos.
“Monsieur, monsieur!” cried a hostler, running out and looking after the stranger, “monsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat!
“You are going to Madame de Morcerf’s, are you not?”
“Do you love her much?”
“Have I the honor of addressing the Abbé Busoni?” asked the visitor.
Oh, ’tis here—’tis here—’tis over—my sight is gone—my senses fail!
“It is you, Bernouin,” she said.
“Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you promised to be patient.”
“I think it is a fine country,” said Haydée, “but I see France as it really is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous.”
The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition, was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy.
“Adieu, my dear cousin.
She did not please; she intoxicated.
“Oh, pray do, for heaven’s sake, tell us all about—is he a vampire, or a resuscitated corpse, or what?”
The young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone could comprehend.
“Well, then,” said Cromwell, “I promise, as far as lies in my power, to grant your request; proceed.”
“Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value?” asked the cardinal, with a smile of disdain.

“Nay, count,” said the baroness, “it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.”
Had this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for when the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the _bourgeoisie_, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily, Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high price; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places, and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place, the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves, and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their number, but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue; and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance, to combine to indemnify him for his loss.

“Your Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la Feronnerie?”
Monte Cristo arose and approached her, took her hand, and said to her in Romaic:
“Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it in the post.
But the abbess, on her part, maintained a reserve still more prudent, contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Eminence.
“He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris to establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.”
“‘I thought that my entreaties——’
At this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter, anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him, had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself.
“What else have you done.”
“We are going, then, we two with our swords, you with daggers.
“And no evil has happened to the young Count de Guiche?” she asked; “for not only is he our servant, as you say, sir, but more—he is one of our friends.”
“Where?
“The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?”
I wished to live,” said Athos.
“The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General Quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”

Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded, and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by enchantment.
“I thank you, gentlemen.
A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her with a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered.
Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left.
“The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you, Madame Bonacieux, and I should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks.”
Napoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him; but of Clement VII.
“‘I follow you.’
“So much the better; they must be good animals, then.”
Everyone held the accusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack.
It became necessary, therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism—a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling.
Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period, and Porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a Musketeer.
“Well,” said Morcerf, impatiently, “what does all this mean?”
“Ah!” he said, wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead, “how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty!”
I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing.
“So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.”
25; the other in the Rue de la Harpe, No.
“Without doubt,” she murmured.
“Listen!
I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend.
“What have they done to you?”
“She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care.”
“Surrounded, I suppose, only by clodhoppers, with whom you could not associate.”
Patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels, however, were not meat and drink, and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent.
We immediately drew, and at the first pass I laid him stark dead.”
“That is, you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions, to quit France and be an exile.”

“Beauchamp,” said Albert, “it is of your journal that I come to speak.”
His countenance, usually so pale, was purple with heat and passion.

“My dear sir,” said Château-Renaud, “allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.
“Ah, ha,” thought Danglars, “this is not so much like Paris, except that I shall probably be skinned!
In a word, the island was inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of God.
I have not been in bed for two nights; but then look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and nights.
Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother’s bed.
“True.
he has the true military style.”
“I never swear, my lord, I say yes or no; and, as I am a gentleman, I keep my word.”
“Scarcely ever; she had business to transact with linen drapers, to whose houses I conducted her.”
The four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful.
“The right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,” said Tréville, who was determined to have the last word, “and my Musketeer is innocent.
And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop.
“What fault do you find with the fellow?”
No one answered to his first knocking.
“The punishment of death,” replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice.
“And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?” inquired Monte Cristo.
“Very well; and you—what will you do?”
“Hush!” said Athos, putting a finger on his lips, with the sad smile peculiar to him; “let us talk no more of Mordaunt—it will bring bad luck.” And Athos set forward toward Charenton, followed closely by Aramis.
His eyes took a strange expression, and with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and attracted the attention of the Musketeers.
The street of Saint Honore, when the cardinal and his party passed through it, was crowded by an assemblage who, standing in groups, discussed the edicts of that memorable day.
Continue to be the good, sweet girl you are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.”

“More determined than ever.”

“I will inquire,” said Morrel.
It was about half-past nine.
“You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o’clock.
It would be impossible to describe Mousqueton’s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching, followed by a sergeant with a dozen men.
“While his name is not Morcerf.”
Whitehall.
To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among mankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always accorded to wealth—that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man.
Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen.
He started, and the prisoner saw that start—for though her eyes were cast down, nothing escaped her.
“That woman—that woman!”
“Master Edward is not downstairs, sir,” replied the valet.
“I never rightly understood those men,” said the queen, as she watched him retiring from her presence; “and it is now too late, for in a year the king will be of age.”
And what did the officers do?”
“By the by, I thank you for the horse you have brought me.”
“Very well,” said the prince; “give it to me later.

After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart, and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a doctor would have done—I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them, and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and cried feebly.
My God, my God, my God!”
Make no allusion to the past; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or ill-fated mother.”
What is proposed to me would be, in fact, almost an abdication, and an abdication requires reflection.”
Ah, yes, it is indeed strange!”
“This time,” said Athos, first breaking the silence, “D’Artagnan has given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.”
May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars?”
“What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and if he chooses to reply, that is his affair.”
Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation.
“And Aramis?”
“Here!
the accusation?”
“My lord, if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago.”
“Ah,” said Mme.
“You told him that?” said Porthos, a broad smile spreading over his honest face.
I felt some degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said.

“And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,” said the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister.
How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten.
The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Bethune.
If you deprive me of that, take away my life also.”
He took the papers, and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence.”
“Oh, sir, if you know who this man is,” cried D’Artagnan, “tell me who he is, and whence he is.
“I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,” said Monte Cristo; “but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear.
Dantès had spoken of Mercédès, and Villefort instantly recognized her.
“If,” replied the duchess, with a meaning look, “you do not say too much against her.”
“Faugh!” he exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.
On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young comrade.
M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in France.

“The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain.
The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety.
“No; but she has become queen of Paris, ad interim, and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the Tuileries, she is installed at the Hotel de Ville, where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke.”
“Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,” replied the young man; “speak, I beg of you.”
A large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth.
“I fancied myself despised, betrayed.
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive.
Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much as poor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.
“It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me.
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door; she had recognized the voice of D’Artagnan.
“Dear D’Artagnan!
“I know you, gentlemen,” said the cardinal, “I know you.
“A Puritan, yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in France.”
D’Artagnan breathed again.

Aramis returned, laughing, one hat on his head and the other in his hand; and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent.
“How?
“How much?”
But still further, his education had been so little neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this time among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which Aramis sported and which Porthos pretended to understand.
Villefort and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.
Grimaud bowed in thanks.
Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket, against which one of the keepers was leaning.
“Why, Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles, and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty, we should be pretty near the amount.”

A dull and heavy sound was heard, and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over on his back.
“Come, come, my little fellow, don’t be angry.
Then, to justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this would cause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the Mediterranean.
“Noirtier the Girondin?—Noirtier the senator?”
“Do you know,” observed Franz, “that with such stories you make me think of Ali Baba’s enchanted cavern?”
One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was coming out as she was going in, and she showed him to me.”
D’Artagnan turned, mechanically looking behind him, and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God.
But he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.
“But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman?”
I am going home.
I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure.
Haydée looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristo’s voice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative.
“Sir,” said Athos, turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt, “here is my sword; have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison.
“Tomorrow, my angel!”
“Poor fellow!” remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart.
“This diamond!” said D’Artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.
“Because that young man, so handsome, so elegant, so polished——”
Mazarin coughed a little.
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin, who paid them numerous compliments, and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired, namely, D’Artagnan his captaincy, Porthos his barony.
“Where?”
For the first time in his life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists in the mind of every human creature, arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart, “Thou shalt die!”
“You prefer, then,” said the abbé, “that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?”
“Very good,” replied Albert; “that is all I wished to know.”
So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket.
Who could ever have believed it!”
But eloquent as he might be, the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV.
“Thomson & French are perfectly solvent,” replied Danglars, with an almost mocking smile; “but the word _unlimited_, in financial affairs, is so extremely vague.”
It was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti’s solicitude, his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his admiration.
“Woman’s, yes; my mother is not woman, but _a_ woman.”
“No, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.”
Well, the poison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however, by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were not, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in favor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of whom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance, the worthy Abbé Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly.”

All eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse.
“Or rather, we are very clever,” said D’Artagnan.
There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which D’Artagnan bowed, as a sign that he listened.
As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual.
“By me; and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any information.”
Ah!

The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richelieu.
“Adieu, Valentine,” repeated Morrel.
As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France.
“And here he comes, by Jupiter!
“Tell us about it.”
Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse.
Unfortunately for D’Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his Eminence’s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it.

In his escape alone, apart from his plans for the future, which, it must be admitted, were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain, there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart.

I am sorry, if you die, that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me.”
This last obstacle having been overcome, the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor; but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace; three of them stopped after an hour’s gallop, and one fell down.
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow.
The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and, shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman.

“We are for the king and the princes,” added Athos.
“What have I to fear, except from you?”
You are too charming,” said D’Artagnan, sorrowfully; “and you abuse my love.”
Morrel was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves.
“Indeed?”
Morrel called her, and she ran to the gate.
Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but the gesture might pass for assent.
“You terrify me, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan.
I, too, would give up that good Monsieur Broussel, dead or alive, and all would be at an end.”
This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment’s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.

“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès.
“Oh, I am a Christian,” cried Dantès, guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him.
The fit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.
The movement was executed in silence and with precision.

“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”

Their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages.
Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers.
How can I tell?
The jailer went away shaking his head.
“Ah!” exclaimed Athos, turning pale.

The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators.

The two friends repaired to Athos’s, and he, faithful to his vow of not going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them.
Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart.
“Do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?”
“Is it true,” asked Gondy, feigning astonishment, “that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion?”
He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether acting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not remain motionless without great impediments; but whence did these impediments arise?
At first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.

A Nightly Patrol.
But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough.”
D’Artagnan, in two steps, was engaged with the foe, whom, according to custom, he attacked impetuously, but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause.
“Good heavens!” cried D’Artagnan, “is the poor fellow worse, then?”

“Let us see,” said D’Artagnan.
“Good!

“Alas, sir,” said he, “I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.”
“You are speaking, you scoundrel!” said Athos, rising upon his elbow, and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.
“Let me see,” said the count; “are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti?”
It was midnight.
Danglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he had seen groaning on his bed.
“No,” said Villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve the—the—oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!” and the procureur again becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.
Grimaud drew out a pistol.
Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in broken words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow.

However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness.
The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house, which D’Artagnan occupied with authority.
We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have plenty of time, and it will be more correct.
“What are these things?” replied Anne, with queen-like dignity, extending toward the open coffer an arm, despite the lapse of years, still beautiful.
Athos smiled.
I am, indeed, to be pitied.
“What a question!”
At six o’clock the curate of St. Merri was announced.
“It means,” replied Mazarin, trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt, “that our parts are changed, and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs; but, gentlemen, I warn you, unless you kill me, your victory will be of very short duration; people will come to the rescue.”
Monte Cristo turned around; Haydée was standing pale, motionless, looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.
“Very well!”
This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him.

It seemed like the _fête_ of Jack-o’-lanterns.
“Yes.”
“And where do you come from?”
“The cardinal?” cried Mme.
“How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?”

oh!” he said, “I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of Orleans.
Let us now go into the adjoining chamber, which is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.”
This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne.

Her attitude, though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect.
Monte Cristo, on stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under an arbor of Virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers, he saw Mercédès seated, with her head bowed, and weeping bitterly.

The latter smiled.

Now, by way of having a resting-place during his excursions, avoiding the wretched cookery—which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months, while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years,—and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber, Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital, he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name.

“My end will be achieved before I grow old.”
M. de Tréville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant of his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to convey his desires to his comrades.

“No.”
“Which?”
Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers, which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.
